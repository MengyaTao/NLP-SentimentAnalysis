"This short technical note presents an attempt to develop a new climatic variable Z for assessing climate change ( global warming) with respect to the built environment. Principal component analysis of long-term (30-year) dry-bulb temperature (DBT), wet-bulb temperature and global solar radiation data was conducted in the 5 major climate zones in China. It was found that while the long-term trend was increasing for the DBT in all 5 major climates, hot summer and warm winter climate zone showed a decreasing trend (though slightly) in the annual and seasonal average Z values. This suggests that climate change might not necessarily result in higher cooling loads in buildings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"As ice caps expanded during each of the last five glaciations, sea level fell at least 120 m below current levels, exposing continental shelves worldwide to create vast areas of new land. As a result of this exposure, the ecology, climate, pedology, and geology of global shorelines were dramatically transformed, which in turn altered the carbon cycle and biodynamics of this new landmass. In this paper, we focus on a little-known hydrogeological phenomenon that may have had profound influences on biodiversity, human evolution, and carbon storage during periods of severe climatic stress of the Pleistocene Ice Ages. We propose that freshwater springs appeared on emerged continental shelves because falling sea level not only drew down and steepened the coastal water table gradient, thus increasing the hydrostatic head on inland groundwater aquifers, but also removed up to 120 m of hydrostatic pressure on the shelf, further enhancing groundwater flow. We call this phenomenon the ""coastal oasis"", a model based on three well-established facts. (1) In all coastal areas of the world, continental aquifers discharge a continuous flow of fresh water to the oceans, (2) Many submarine sedimentary and morphological features, as well as seepages and flow of fresh water, are known on and below the shelves from petroleum explorations, deep-sea drilling programs, and mariners' observations. (3) Hydraulic principles (Darcy's law) predict increased groundwater flow at the coast when sea level drops because the piezometric head increases by the equivalent depth of sea-level lowering. Sea level is presently in a relatively high interglacial position. Direct observation and verification of our model is difficult and must rely on explorations of terrain that are now deeply submerged on continental shelves. For this reason, we draw parallels between our predicted model and simple, well-exposed terrestrial hydrological systems, such as present-day springs that appear on the exposed shores of lakes whose free-air water levels fell during periods of aridity. Such modem examples are seen in the Caspian Sea and Dead Sea, the Afar Depression, and the Sahara Desert. These modem analogues demonstrate the likelihood that underground water will be more abundant on emerged shelves during sea-level fall, causing springs, oases, and wetlands to appear. Our model creates an apparent paradox: in tropical and subtropical arid lands, such as most of Africa, sea-level fall during hyperarid glacial phases would produce abundant fresh water flow onto emerged continental shelves as the continental interior desiccated. Thus, emergent shoreline springs provided new habitats for terrestrial vegetation and animals displaced from the interior by increasingly and conditions, shrinking ecosystems, and dwindling water supplies, Such a scenario would have had a profound influence on the vegetation that spreads naturally to colonize the emerged shelves during glacio-eustatic sea-level lowstands, as well as creating new habitats for terrestrial mammals, including early humans.

"Determining the capacity of organisms to acclimate and adapt to increased temperatures is key to understand how populations and communities will respond to global warming. Although there is evidence that elevated water temperature affects metabolism, growth and condition of tropical marine fish, it is unknown whether they have the potential to acclimate, given adequate time. We reared the tropical reef fish Acanthochromis polyacanthus through its entire life cycle at present day and elevated (+5 and+3.0 degrees C) water temperatures to test its ability to thermally acclimate to ocean temperatures predicted to occur over the next 50-100 years. Fish reared at 3.0 degrees C greater than the present day average reduced their resting oxygen consumption (RMR) during summer compared with fish reared at present day temperatures and tested at the elevated temperature. The reduction in RMR of up to 69 mg O-2 kg-1 h-1 in acclimated fish could represent a significant benefit to daily energy expenditure. In contrast, there was no acclimation to summer temperatures exhibited by fish reared at 5 degrees C above present day temperatures. Fish acclimated to +3.0 degrees C were smaller and in poorer condition than fish reared at present day temperatures, suggesting that even with acclimation there will be significant consequences for future populations of tropical fishes caused by global warming.",0
"Epiphytes are one of the most ubiquitous elements of tropical forest canopies, including seasonally dry tropical forests. Given the temporal variation in weather conditions in the latter, epiphyte populations may be subject to wide temporal variation in seedling recruitment, reproductive success, vegetative propagation and mortality rate. In this study, we use a 3-y demographic data set for Tillandsia brachycaulos to project its long-term population dynamics through the use of average and periodic matrices, as well as stochastic simulations. The results show that demographic behaviour varied over the 3 years of study, apparently in relation to rainfall. The first 2 years yielded a low lambda value (0.79 and 0.80 - although only the former was significantly lower than unity), while the third year resulted in a lambda = 08 (not significantly different from 0). When incorporating this demographic variation in an average matrix, a periodic matrix and stochastic simulations, the resulting overall lambda was below unity in all three cases. The projections of the stochastic simulations suggest that the population would be able to persist in the long run only if the frequency of 'good' years (defined here as those with an August rainfall above 200 mm) was above 0.6, which appears unlikely given that global warming might result in a lower frequency of rainy years in tropical dry forests.",0
" Interannual-decadal variability in the equatorial Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) induces climate changes at global scale, but its potential influence during past global climate change is not yet well constrained. New high-resolution eastern equatorial Pacific proxy records of thermocline conditions present new evidence of strong orbital control in ENSO-like variability over the last 275,000 years. Recurrent intervals of saltier thermocline waters are associated with the dominance of La Nina-like conditions during glacial terminations, coinciding with periods of low precession and high obliquity. The parallel dominance of delta(13)C-depleted waters supports the advection of Antarctic origin waters toward the tropical thermocline. This ""oceanic tunneling'' is proposed to have reinforced orbitally induced changes in ENSO-like variability, composing a complex high- and low-latitude feedback during glacial terminations.",0
"Most glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere reached their postglacial maximum in recent times, that is, after the medieval period. During the last 100 or 150 years a significant retreat has taken place, and there is little sign that this is coming to an end. The current worldwide shrinkage of glaciers is considered to be a strong indication of global warming. However, glacier retreat should be judged against the natural variability of glacier systems. Numerical glacier models can be used to quantify this variability. I have studied the natural variability of three glaciers for which long historic records of glacier length exist: Nigardsbreen, Norway; Rhonegletscher, Switzerland; and FranzJosefGlacier, New Zealand. Integrations for a 10 000 year period, driven by random forcing of a realistic strength, show that the current retreat cannot be explained from natural variability in glacier length and must be due to external forcing.",0
"Decomposer fungi are primary decomposing agents in terrestrial soils. Their mycelial networks play an important role in nutrient mineralisation and distribution, but are also nutritious resources for various soil invertebrates. Global climate change is predicted to alter the diversity and community composition of these soil fauna. To understand whether changes in invertebrate species diversity are likely to affect fungal-mediated decomposition, this study compared the grazing potentials of different invertebrate taxa and functional groups. Specifically, the grazing impacts of seven invertebrate taxa on the growth and spatial distribution of six basidiomycete fungi growing from beech wood blocks in soil microcosms were explored. Wood decay rates by fungi were also compared. The consequences of grazing were both taxon- and species-specific. Generally, macro-invertebrates caused the greatest damage, while meso- and micro-invertebrates often stimulated mycelial growth. Invertebrate size, preferences and population dynamics are likely to influence grazing potentials. Effects of grazing varied between fungi, with mycelial morphology and biochemistry possibly influencing susceptibility. Heavy grazing indirectly increased fungal-mediated wood decomposition. Changes in invertebrate community composition are predicted to have consequences for fungal growth, activity and community structure in woodland soils. Abiotic climate change factors including CO(2) and temperature affect mycelial productivity directly, but the indirect effects, mediated through changes in the soil invertebrate community, may be equally important in controlling ecosystem functioning.",0
"Using a geographic information system (GIS), by analysis of the relationship between the spatial distribution of cattle density and the risk factors temperature, altitude and rainfall, we defined geographical habitats enabling optimal development and competence of Culicoides spp. to transmit Bluetongue-Virus (BTV). Risk zones (low, high, highest risk) were identified mainly in Baden-Wurttemberg, Hessen and Rheinland-Pfalz. If persistently infected ruminants are imported into these zones in summer (June to August mainly), based on the current climatic conditions, BTD outbreaks are considered a real possibility. Overwintering of the virus seems unlikely. However, global warming will lead to a steady increase of the size of the risk zones. In addition,the possibility of primary outbreaks increases. The reason for this is not only the expected northern shift of Culicoides imicola, but in addition an increasing vector competence of domestic Culicoides species. We therefore recommend the storage of vaccines as well as conducting ecological studies analysing the presence of Culicoides vectors. Using the data from these studies, it will be possible to produce updated quantitative risk assessment via GIS.",0
"Based on an exceptionally long modern ecological dataset (41 years), it has been possible to show that warm weather in England associated with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index causes the spring migration of the green spruce aphid (Elatobium abietinum), a pest species of spruce trees (Picea) to start earlier, continue for longer and contain more aphids. An upward trend in the NAO index during the period 1966-2006 is associated with an increasing population size of E. abietinum. It is important to understand the mechanisms behind the population fluctuations, because this aphid causes considerable damage to Picea plantations. Present day weather-associated fluctuations in forest insect pests may be useful analogues in understanding past pest outbreaks in forests. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.",0
"Uncertainty about predicted effects of global warming on freshwater ecosystems led us to manipulate the thermal regime of a shallow groundwater ecosystem. The study area was separated into a control and treatment block using a sheet-metal groundwater divide to a depth of 1 m. Temperatures were increased according to General Circulation Model (GCM) projections for Southern Ontario, Canada. We examined the response of the groundwater chironomid community during pre-manipulation, manipulation and recovery periods. We found that warming decreased the total abundance of chironomids whereas no significant change in taxonomic richness was apparent. Interestingly, taxon composition changed markedly during both the manipulation and the recovery period. Whereas Heterotrissocladius disappeared during the manipulation in the treatment block, other coldstenothermal taxa such as Micropsectra, Parametriocnemus and Heleniella remained unaffected. Conversely, Corynoneura, Polypedilum and Thienemannia gracilis disappeared but were not reported as coldstenothermal. The chironomid community composition in the system changed from a Heterotrissocladius, Brillia, and Tanytarsini-dominated community during the pre-manipulation towards one dominated by Parametriocnemus, Polypedilum, Orthocladius/Cricotopus and Corynoneura during the recovery. Although increased temperature had a strong effect, chironomid occurrence was also influenced by a number of other abiotic variables, such as dissolved oxygen, depth, ammonia concentration and TDS (Total dissolved solids).",0
"Both the general public and governmental agencies highly prioritize resource optimization (energy and material) and environmental issues such as ozone, acid rain and global warming in the life-cycle context. Disassembly and recycling are also increasingly important in most industrial countries due to the significant increase in the quantity of used products being discarded. Disassembly of used products has been recognized as necessary to make recycling economically viable in current state-of-the-art reprocessing technology. This emerging trend requires incorporating environmental considerations into design strategies. This study presents a graph-based heuristic method for disassembly analysis of end-of-life products, which incorporates the Eco-Design concept. Product components and their assembly relationships from the bill of material BOM are adopted to split the graph into sub-graphs denoting modular sub-assemblies. The life-cycle analysis LCA is then used to analyze disassembly trees, from which a disassembly sequence can be derived. Designers can use the analytical results to evaluate the dis-assemblability and recyclability of products when they are designed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"In introducing the complex subject of global warming, books and papers usually use the zero-dimensional greenhouse model. When the ratio of the infrared radiation energy of the Earth's surface that is lost to outer space to the non-reflected average solar radiation energy is small, the model admits an accurate approximate analytical solution - the resulting energy balance equation of the model is a quartic equation that can be solved analytically - and thus provides an alternative solution and instructional strategy. A search through the literature fails to find an analytical solution, suggesting that the solution may be new. In this paper, we review the model, derive the approximation and obtain its solution. The dependence of the temperature of the surface of the Earth and the temperature of the atmosphere on seven parameters is made explicit. A simple and convenient formula for global warming ( or cooling) in terms of the percentage change of the parameters is derived. The dependence of the surface temperature on the parameters is illustrated by several representative graphs.",0
"We propose that past abrupt climate changes were probably a result of rapid and extensive variations in sea-ice cover. We explain why this seems a perhaps more likely explanation than a purely thermohaline circulation mechanism. We emphasize that because of the significant influence of sea ice on the climate system, it seems that high priority should be given to developing ways for reconstructing high-resolution (in space and time) sea-ice extent for past climate-change events. If proxy data can confirm that sea ice was indeed the major player in past abrupt climate-change events, it seems less likely that such dramatic abrupt changes will occur due to global warming, when extensive sea-ice cover will not be present.",0
"Some areas have experienced recent dramatic warming due to climate change, while others have shown no change at all, or even recent cooling. We predicted that patterns of selection on life history would differ between southern and northern European populations of a long-distance migratory bird, the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, because global patterns of weather as reflected by large-scale weather phenomena such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the El NiA +/- o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have different effects on environmental conditions in different parts of the world frequented during the annual cycle. We investigated relationships between mean arrival date, dispersal rate and yearling survival rate among years, using two long-term population studies in Spain and Denmark. We found evidence of a difference in the effects of normalized difference vegetation index in North and West Africa on mean arrival date of male barn swallows, with the effect differing significantly between populations. Second, there was a significant interaction between ENSO and population on dispersal rate, showing that conditions in Africa during winter differentially affected dispersal in the two populations. Finally, the NAO index in winter had an effect on yearling survival that differed between populations. These findings highlight the divergent patterns of response to climate change among populations, and they suggest that climate change can differentially affect important life history traits with potential implications for maintenance of viable populations and gene flow among populations.",0
"The forest cover in the hill country river catchment areas of Sri Lanka has been reduced to isolated patches on hilltops and a handful of reserves above the 1524 m (5000 ft) contour. Most of the land that was under forest cover at the turn of the nineteenth century is now covered with plantation crops. The districts of Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Ratnapura and Kegalle are the main hill country plantation areas. Within a period of less than half a century most of the forests in the hill country were cleared for plantation crops. Shifting cultivation was responsible for deforestation in the drier parts of the hill country. At the time of the British conquest of the hill country, the population of the whole island was not more than 3/4 to 1 million and they had settled in isolated villages at elevations below 1066 m. Subsistence agriculture was the main occupation of this predominantly rural population. During the first phase (1830-1880) of the plantation industry, large tracts of mostly forest land were cleared for coffee cultivation. By 1878, the extent of the coffee plantations reached its maximum of 111 336 ha most of which was situated in the wet zone hill country. The second phase of plantation agriculture began as the coffee industry was completely wiped out by a leaf disease. Most of the abandoned coffee plantations and the remaining forests were converted to tea, rubber and cinchona estates. The first two crops managed to survive price fluctuations in the world market, while the latter collapsed because of over production. During the period of large-scale deforestation in the hill country, the climate also underwent changes as exemplified by rainfall and temperature trends. However, these trends are not uniform everywhere in the plantation areas of the hill country. The temperature has risen a few degrees over a period of about a century and quarter in the hill country stations, while rainfall has declined significantly at some stations. These changes seem to be a result of the interaction of both global and local factors. Although some of these changes would have been a result of global warming, land use change would also have contributed to regional disparities. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
"The number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) formed as a result of anthropogenic emissions is a key uncertainty in the study of aerosol indirect forcing and global climate change. Here, we use a global aerosol model that includes an empirical boundary layer nucleation mechanism, the use of primary-emitted sulfate particles to represent sub-grid scale nucleation, as well as binary homogeneous nucleation to explore how nucleation affects the CCN concentration and the first aerosol indirect effect (AIE). The inclusion of the boundary layer nucleation scheme increases the global average CCN concentrations in the boundary layer by 34% when no primary-emitted sulfate particles are included and by 5.3% when they are included. Particle formation with the boundary layer nucleation scheme decreases the first indirect forcing over ocean, and increases the first indirect forcing over land when primary sulfate particles are included. This suggests that whether particle formation from aerosol nucleation increases or decreases aerosol indirect effects largely depends on the relative change of primary particles and SO2 emissions from the preindustrial to the present day atmosphere. Including primary-emitted sulfate particle significantly increases both the anthropogenic fraction of CCN concentrations and the first aerosol indirect forcing. The forcing from various treatments of aerosol nucleation ranges from -22 to -2.03 w/m(2). This large variation shows the importance of better quantifying aerosol nucleation mechanisms for the prediction of CCN concentrations and aerosol indirect effects.",0
"We propose a methodology combining a biophysical site index model and a seed source transfer model based on both temperature and precipitation to estimate white spruce plantation yield under present and future global warming conditions. The biophysical site index model predicts dominant height at 25 years, which is further used to estimate plantation yield using yield tables. The transfer model shows that, on average, seed sources are best adapted to the temperature conditions where they presently grow, and give maximum yield under these conditions. However, this model also shows that transfer of seed sources to drier sites could improve plantation yield. To predict site index values under climate change conditions, values obtained from the biophysical site index model are corrected by a factor estimated using the seed source transfer model. Our simulation results predict that global warming should favour a slight increase in white spruce plantation yield in southern Quebec. However, one cannot expect to obtain similar yields from a seed source rapidly exposed to warmer conditions compared with a seed source that is presently growing under climatic conditions to which it has become adapted. It would take several generations (adaptation lag) for a seed source to adapt to warmer conditions. We believe that the method we propose will be helpful in identifying the most productive seed source to be used at any given location in the province, and in revising seed source transfer rules.",0
"Four populations of Phragmites australis collected from geographically distinct areas in Europe were propagated in outdoor experimental plots at four sites with dissimilar climate (Denmark, The Netherlands, Spain and Czech Republic). During the second growing season the photosynthetic characteristics of Phragmites leaves were evaluated under controlled conditions for each site, each population, and their interaction, and related to tissue nutrient and pigment content. The light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (P-max), dark respiration rate (R-d), light compensation point (I-c), and apparent quantum efficiency (phi (i)) were significantly affected by growth site, whereas differences between populations were less pronounced. Plants grown in the more northerly climates appeared to be more photosynthetically limited through lower P-max values and lower phi (i) levels, reflecting phenotypic acclimation to the lower summer temperatures and irradiance levels at the northern growth sites. The higher P-max levels in the southern climate were correlated with higher nutrient levels in the tissue of leaves. The study shows that the four genetically distinct populations of P. australis exhibited high phenotypic plasticity in photosynthetic response to climatic change. The degree of photosynthetic plasticity within P. australis genotypes is large, and generally larger than the genetically determined differences between European populations. The results are discussed in relation to the prospected global climate change. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Rising global carbon dioxide levels may lead to profound changes in plant composition, regardless of the degree of global warming that may result from the accumulation of this greenhouse gas. We studied the interaction of a CO2 doubling and two levels of nitrogen fertilizer on the growth and chemical composition of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreber cv. KY-31) when infected and uninfected with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams. Two-year-old plants were harvested to 5 cm every 4 weeks, and after 12 weeks of growth plants grown in twice ambient CO2 concentrations: photosynthesized 15% more; produced tillers at a faster rate; produced 53% more dry matter (DM) yield under low N conditions and 61% more DM under high N conditions; the % organic matter (OM) was little changed except under elevated CO2 and high N when %OM increased by 3%; lignin decreased by 14%; crude protein (CP) concentrations (as %DM) declined by 21%; the soluble CP fraction (as %CP) increased by 13%; the acid detergent insoluble CP fraction (as %CP) increased by 12%, and in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility declined by 5% under high N conditions but not under low N. Plants infected with the endophytic fungus: photosynthesized 16% faster in high N compared with under low N; flowered earlier than uninfected plants; had 28% less lignin in high N compared with under low N; and had much smaller reductions in CP concentration (as %DM) and smaller increases in the soluble CP fraction (as %CP) and the acid detergent insoluble CP fraction (as %CP) under elevated CO2. Such large and varied changes in plant quality are likely to have large and significant effects on the herbivore populations that feed from these plants.",0
"Coastal zones are widely recognised as being particularly vulnerable to future environmental change. Although a significant number of previous papers warn of an increasing tendency in the appearance of eutrophication processes in such systems, very few papers have evaluated the influence of global climate change on eutrophication. In the Mar Menor lagoon (SE Spain), the high biomass of the main primary producer, Caulerpa prolifera Forsskal (Lamououx), covers most of the bottom, and has probably increased the resistance of the lagoon to eutrophication processes through the high uptake of nutrients from the water column and their retention in the sediments, avoiding high phytoplankton densities. Nevertheless, if climate change predictions become true, the current status of the lagoon is likely to collapse, since future environmental conditions could make C. prolifera unable to reach values of net photosynthesis greater than zero, and eutrophication processes are expected to appear.

"Despite a growing appreciation of the need to protect sensitive deep sea ecosystems such as cold-water corals, efforts to map the extent of their distribution are limited by their remoteness. Here we develop ecological niche models to predict the likely distributions of cold-water corals based on occurrence records and data describing environmental parameters (e.g. seafloor terrain attributes and oceanographic conditions). This study has used bathymetric data derived from ship-borne multibeam swath systems, species occurrence data from remotely operated vehicle video surveys and oceanographic parameters from hydrodynamic models to predict coral locations in regions where there is a paucity of direct observations. Predictions of the locations of the scleractinian coral, Lophelia pertusa are based primarily upon ecological niche modelling using a genetic algorithm. Its accuracy has been quantified at local (similar to 25 km(2)) and regional scales (similar to 4000 km(2)) along the Irish continental slope using a variety of error assessment techniques and a comparison with another ecological niche modelling technique. With appropriate choices of parameters and scales of analyses, ecological niche modelling has been effective in predicting the distributions of species at local and regional scales. Refinements of this approach have the potential to be particularly useful for ocean management given the need to manage areas of sensitive habitat where survey data are often limited.

"The larger-foraminifera turnover (LIFT) during the Paleocene-Eocene transition constitutes an important step in Paleogene larger-foraminifera evolution, involving a rapid increase in species diversity, shell size, and adult dimorphism. A platform-to-basin transect in Egypt provides new data on timing and causal mechanisms through correlation with planktic biozonations and through integration with regional paleoenvironmental data. The LFT coincides with the boundary between shallow benthic biozones SBZ4 and SBZ5 and closely correlates with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Enhanced oligotrophy from the late Paleocene onward favored the diversification of K-strategist larger foraminifera. We suggest that a short-term eutrophication during the PETM led to a temporary decline of extreme K-strategist larger-foraminifera species, providing opportunities for new taxa, with different ecological strategies to develop. During post-PETM oligotrophic conditions, these new taxa were able to evolve rapidly and soon dominated early Eocene larger-foraminifera assemblages, whereas many Paleocene taxa gradually disappeared. The success of larger foraminifera during the early Paleogene appears climatically controlled. Because of the vulnerability of corals to high surface-water temperatures, the late Paleocene to early Eocene global warming may have favored larger foraminifera at the expense of corals as the main carbonate-producing component on carbonate platforms at lower latitudes.",0
"Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is an important sulfur-containing atmospheric trace gas of marine biogenic origin. DMS emitted from the oceans may be a precursor of tropospheric aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thereby affecting the Earth's radiative balance and possibly constituting a negative feedback to global warming, although this hypothesis is still somewhat controversial. The revised conceptual model of the marine pelagic food web gives a central role to planktonic bacteria. Recent experiments have shown that consumption of dissolved DMS by microbial metabolism may be more important than atmospheric exchange in controlling its concentration in surface waters and hence its ventilation to the atmosphere. In this paper we investigate the effect of the marine food web on cycling of dissolved DMS in surface waters during a phytoplankton bloom episode. A nitrogen-based flow network simulation model has been used to analyze the relative importance of the various biological and chemical processes involved. The model predictions suggest that the concentration of DMS in marine surface waters is indeed governed by bacterial metabolism. Environmental factors that affect the bacterial compartment are thus likely to have a relatively large influence on dissolved DMS concentrations. The ecological succession is particularly sensitive to the ratio of phytoplankton to bacterial nutrient uptake rates as well the interaction between herbivore food chain and the microbial loop. Importantly for the design of field studies, the model predicts that peak DMS concentrations are achieved during the decline of the phytoplankton bloom with a typical time lag between peak DMS and peak phytoplankton biomass of 1 to 2 days. Significantly, the model predicts a relatively high DMS concentration persisting after the phytoplankton bloom due to excretion from large protozoa and zooplankton, which may be an additional ''planation for the lack of correlation between DMS and chlorophyll a field measurements. Comparison of the model predictions has been made with tank algal bloom experiments.",0
"The history of life is written in the ocean, and the history of the ocean is written in DNA. Geologists have shown us that hundreds of millions of years of ocean history can be revealed from records of a single phylum in cores of mud from abyssal plains. We are now accumulating genetic tools to unravel the relationships of hundreds of phyla to track this history back billions of years. The technologies demonstrated by the Census of Marine Life (CoML) mean that the ocean is no longer opaque or unknowable. The secrets of the largest component of the biosphere are knowable. The cost of understanding the history of ocean life is not cheap, but it is also not prohibitive. A transparent, open ocean is available for us to use to understand ourselves. This article develops a model of biodiversity equilibration in a single, physically static ocean as a step towards biodiversity in physically complex real oceans. It attempts to be quantitative and to simultaneously account for biodiversity patterns from bacteria to whales focusing on emergent proper-ties rather than details. Biodiversity reflects long-term survival of DNA sequences, stabilizing ""ecosystem services"" despite environmental change. In the ocean, mechanisms for ensuring survival range from prokaryotes maintaining low concentrations of replicable DNA throughout the ocean volume, anticipating local change, to animals whose mobility increases with mass to avoid local change through movement. Whales can reach any point in the ocean in weeks, but prokaryotes can only diffuse. The high metabolic costs of mobility are offset by the dramatically lower number of DNA replicates required to ensure survival. Reproduction rates probably scale more or less inversely with body mass. Bacteria respond in a week, plankton in a year, whales in a century. We generally lack coherent theories to explain the origins of animals (metazoans) and the contributions of biodiversity to ecosystems. The One Ocean Model suggests that mobile metazoans paved the way for their own energetic life styles by decreasing the amount of primary production sinking to feed the benthic anaerobic prokaryotes. Increasing metazoan mobility and diversity ensured that less and less production sank and accelerated development of the aerobic oceans they require. High biodiversity among middle-sized organisms stabilizes the system, but rapid environmental changes can decrease diversity in a positive feedback loop ending in mass extinction events and the return of the anaerobes. The oceans have gone through this cycle several times. Global warming may be a mild flu compared to ""the revenge of the microbes"". (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Within-population variation in phenology of boreal trees indicates their adaptability to climatic variations. Although interannual variations in date of bud burst have been widely discussed, little is known about within-population variation, the key determinants for this variation and the effects of this variation on estimates of trends in bud burst date. Over a period of nine years, we monitored timing of bud burst daily in 30 mature white birch (Betula pendula Roth) trees in a naturally regenerated stand. Our results revealed not only large interannual variation but also considerable intraannual variation among individual trees in date of bud burst, the maximum within-population variation being four weeks. Bud burst can be accurately predicted by the date when a threshold value of temperature sum in spring is reached (base temperature +5 degrees C). Based on this temperature sum and past temperature records, we estimated the trend in date of bud burst. The linear trend estimate based on the years 1926-2005 is an advancement of 2 days per decade (95% confidence interval, +/- 0.7 days), which is much less than that predicted by time series based on coarser time intervals. We conclude that, because of large interannual differences, and large annual within-population variations in bud burst, estimates of bud burst date based on measurements made over a period of only a few decades are unreliable.",0
"Three typical constructed wetlands (CWs) including Vertical Flow (VF), Free Water Surface (FWS), and Subsurface Flow (SF), and combined VF-SF-FWS constructed wetlands were investigated for the treatment of domestic wastewater with low C/N ratio. The performance of nutrient removal and the characteristics of greenhouse gas emissions, such as CH(4) and N(2)O, from these CWs were compared. The results indicated that the four types of CWs had high removal efficiencies for organic matter and suspended solid (SS). The combined wetland also showed a comparatively good performance for nitrogen and phosphorus removal, and the removal efficiencies for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were 83% and 84.5%, respectively. The combined CWs had a comparative lower global warming potential. The FWS CW had the highest tendency to emit CH(4) and led to a higher global warming potential among the four types of CWs, which was about 586 mg CO(2)/m(2).h.",0
This paper tests whether climate has an impact on per capita rural income. The study finds that total (agricultural and nonagricultural) income in rural counties and municipios in the US and Brazil are affected by climate. The study demonstrates that this income effect is due to changes in the net value of agriculture. Regions with better climates for agriculture support higher rural incomes and regions with poor climates have more rural poverty. The results also suggest that global warming will likely increase rural poverty.,0
"In 1989 the seasonal cycles of most common decapod larvae in Continuous Plankton Recorder samples taken in the North Sea were significantly different from those described for 1947-1951 and for 1981-1983. In all cases where the differences were significant the larvae occurred earlier in 1989 than in previous years. Zoeae of Atelecyclus rotundatus were found in the Southern Bight in the spring. The winter of 1988-1989 was exceptionally mild with air temperatures over Great Britain 2-3-degrees-C above average and positive temperature anomalies persisted through the year. The sea surface temperatures in the North Sea were also mainly higher than usual. The events were treated as a ''natural experiment'' to examine effects of the high temperatures on seasonal cycles of decapod larval production and the implications of these effects for marine communities with reference to predicted global warming. The relationships between timing of occurrence of the larvae in the plankton and parameters of sea temperatures were generally consistent with previous results from studies of geographical variations, and possible causal mechanisms are discussed in the light of the 1989 data.",0
"Predictions of effects of global climate change include decreased runoff for many parts of the world, which will result in drying of streams. Information of the effects of drought on aquatic ecosystems is limited and little is known of the effects on ecosystem functions. Our main objective was to measure the direct effects of drought on leaf litter breakdown by invertebrate shredders in a controlled laboratory experiment. We hypothesized a decreased breakdown at high drought level. Single-species and multi-species treatments with three shredder species (Asellus aquaticus, Limnephilus bipunctatus, and L. flavicornis) were set up in an experiment with three drought level treatments, control, medium, and high drought (6 cm water level, 1 cm water level, and water level below sediment surface, respectively). Breakdown measured as leaf litter loss was significantly lower in both medium and high drought treatments compared to the control. Previously, decreased breakdown due to drying has been reported, but attributed to low densities of invertebrate shredders. We show that even when shredders are present, drought decreases the breakdown. Drought treatments also induced earlier pupation for the caddisfly L. flavicornis. Shifts in species phenology due to drought, e.g., earlier emergence, may affect species ability to adult survival and reproduction. Shifts in timing of emergence may also affect terrestrial food webs, where emerging aquatic insects may constitute an important food subsidy. Our knowledge of the complex effects of droughts in aquatic systems is limited with an urgent need of extended knowledge of the ecological effects of droughts on freshwater ecosystem functioning.",0
"Several ""Great Salinity Anomalies'' have been observed to propagate around the North Atlantic sub-polar gyre over the past 40 years. These could be a response to global warming, or part of the natural variability of the climate system. Here, we find ""Great Salinity Anomalies'' in the HadCM3 coupled climate simulation of pre-industrial climate, suggesting they are not a response to recent climatic change. In concurrence with observed events, the HadCM3 simulation produces events which originate in both the Greenland and Labrador Seas.",0
"This paper presents a small-scale version of an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) of global climate change, which is based on a global, regionally differentiated computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with endogenous technological change. This model can be viewed as a basic framework for analyzing a broad range of economic issues related to climate change, in particular since technological change is represented in two ways: on the one hand, there is learning-by-doing (LbD) in non-fossil energy supply technologies, and on the other hand there is research and development (R&D)-driven energy-saving technical progress in production. Computational experiments are added for illustrating the role of technological innovation in a world both with and without cooperation in the solution of the global climate problem.

"Recent global climate model simulations for the IPCC Fourth Assessment report show a realistic North Pacific storm track and Aleutian Low for present-day climate conditions. Under climate change, the storm track and Aleutian Low move northward and intensify. These changes shift precipitation northward along the Pacific coast of North America. In particular, precipitation is intensified over the Pacific Northwest. Results from a statistical downscaling model suggest that precipitation may become more intense both due to the increased frequency of large-scale storms and due to changes in the interaction of these storms with the local terrain.",0
"Aerosols are known to influence the climate system in a range of ways; they affect radiation budgets, cloud formation and circulation patterns, and contribute to local biogeochemical cycling and ecology. Despite this recognized role for marine aerosol, however, recent research has emphasized the impact of global climate change on coastal environments rather than the other way around. This occurs in part because most methods for sampling marine aerosol are expensive and studies tend to occur only on specialized marine stations and ocean-crossing research vessels. This project tests a new method for aerosol sampling, specifically designed for use in local studies of coastal environments and costing little to set up. It also reports the results of a pilot study in Alderney (Channel Islands) where changes in both aerosol abundance and aerosol composition, including fractionation effects, were observed using the new method and linked to local meteorological conditions.",0
"Aim Many species are currently expanding their ranges in response to climate change, but the mechanisms underlying these range expansions are in many cases poorly understood. In this paper we explore potential climatic factors governing the recent establishment of new palm populations far to the north of any other viable palm population in the world. Location Southern Switzerland, Europe, Asia and the world. Methods We identified ecological threshold values for the target species, Trachycarpus fortunei, based on gridded climate data, altitude and distributional records from the native range and applied them to the introduced range using local field monitoring and measured meteorological data as well as a bioclimatic model. Results We identified a strong relationship between minimum winter temperatures, influenced by growing season length and the distribution of the palm in its native range. Recent climate change strongly coincides with the palm's recent spread into southern Switzerland, which is in concert with the expansion of the global range of palms across various continents. Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that the expansion of palms into (semi-)natural forests is driven by changes in winter temperature and growing season length and not by delayed population expansion. This implies that this rapid expansion is likely to continue in the future under a warming climate. Palms in general, and T. fortunei in particular, are significant bioindicators across continents for present-day climate change and reflect a global signal towards warmer conditions.",0
"The garden tiger moth (Arctia caja) was once widespread and common in the UK. Data collected using the standard light-traps of the Rothamsted Insect Survey over Great Britain from 1968 to 1998 showed that A. caja abundance fluctuated near 4.2 captures per site until 1983, and then fell 28% to an average of 3.0 captures per site after 1984. The collated index, frequently used to monitor UK butterfly abundance, was not suitable to detect this large, 1-year population change. Four years after the sudden decrease in abundance, the proportion of sites occupied also fell rapidly from an average of 0.60 to an average of 0.42 (30%). Contrary to most UK butterflies, which are expected to increase under the UK climate change scenarios of global warming, linear regression modelling showed that warm, wet winters and springs may be detrimental to A. caja and it is therefore predicted to decrease further.

"Large mammals re-introduced into harsh and unpredictable environments are vulnerable to stochastic effects, particularly in times of global climate change. The Mongolian Gobi is home to several rare large ungulates such as re-introduced Przewalski's horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) and Asiatic wild asses (Equus hemionus), but also to a millennium-old seminomadic livestock herding culture. The Gobi is prone to large inter-annual environmental fluctuations, but the winter 2009/ 2010 was particularly severe. Millions of livestock died and the Przewalski's horse population in the Gobi crashed. We used spatially explicit livestock loss statistics, ranger survey data and GPS telemetry to provide insight into the effect of a catastrophic climate event on the two sympatric wild equid species and the livestock population in light of their different space use strategies. Herders in and around the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area lost on average 67% of their livestock. Snow depth varied locally, resulting in livestock losses following an east-west gradient. Herders had few possibilities for evasion, as competition for available winter camps was high. Przewalski's horses used three different winter ranges, two in the east and one in the west. Losses averaged 60%, but differed hugely between east and west. Space use of Przewalski's horses was extremely conservative, as groups did not attempt to venture beyond their known home ranges. Asiatic wild asses seemed to have suffered few losses by shifting their range westwards. The catastrophic winter 2009/ 2010 provided a textbook example for how vulnerable small and spatially confined populations are in an environment prone to environmental fluctuations and catastrophes. This highlights the need for disaster planning by local herders, multiple reintroduction sites with spatially dispersed populations for re-introduced Przewalski's horses, and a landscape-level approach beyond protected area boundaries to allow for migratory or nomadic movements in Asiatic wild asses.",0
"Iceberg discharges from continental ice sheets are widely believed to have exerted a great influence on global climate, but an iceberg discharge regime in early glacial periods after intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG) remains largely unclear. Here we present high-resolution rock magnetic records during the period from 2.1 to 2.75 Ma after intensification of NHG, reconstructed from the subpolar North Atlantic. Although the establishment of the middle Pliocene chronology of North Atlantic sediments is often a serious problem, we overcame it based on findings concerning the properties of magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma radiation. Reconstructed rock magnetic records indicate that millennial-scale iceberg surges were dominant features in the early glacial periods. Additionally, the millennial-scale iceberg surges occurred within glacial stages during intervals when ratios of global oxygen isotope stack from benthic foraminifera (LR04 delta O-18 stack) surpassed approximately 3.5 parts per thousand. These are comparable to the climatic and environmental changes in Pleistocene glacial periods as represented by last glacial Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, suggesting that continental ice sheets have oscillated and calved icebergs in a similar manner since intensification of NHG.",0
"Breeding at the right time is essential for animals in seasonal climates in order to ensure that the energy demands of reproduction, particularly the nutritional requirements of growing young, coincide with peak food availability. Global climate change is likely to cause shifts in the timing of peak food availability, and in order to adapt successfully to current and future climate change, animals need to be able to adjust the time at which they initiate breeding. Many animals use environmental cues available before the breeding season to predict the seasonal peak in food availability and adjust their phenology accordingly. We tested the hypothesis that regulation of breeding onset should reflect the scale at which organisms perceive their environment by comparing phenology of three seabird species at a North Sea colony. As predicted, the phenology of two dispersive species, black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and common guillemot (Uria aalge), correlated with a large-scale environmental cue (the North Atlantic Oscillation), whereas a resident species, European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), was more affected by local conditions (sea surface temperature) around the colony. Annual mean breeding success was lower in late years for European shags, but not for the other two species. Since correlations among climate patterns at different scales are likely to change in the future, these findings have important implications for how migratory animals can respond to future climate change.",0
"The activities associated with raw milk production on dairy farms require an effective evaluation of their environmental impact. The present study evaluates the global environmental impacts associated with milk production on dairy farms in Portugal and identifies the processes that have the greatest environmental impact by using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The main factors involved in milk production were included, namely: the dairy farm, maize silage, ryegrass silage, straw, concentrates, diesel and electricity. The results suggest that the major source of air and water emissions in the life cycle of milk is the production of concentrates. The activities carried out on dairy farms were the major source of nitrous oxides (from fuel combustion), ammonia, and methane (from manure management and enteric fermentation). Nevertheless, dairy farm activities, which include manure management, enteric fermentation and diesel consumption, make the greatest contributions to the categories of impact considered, with the exception of the abiotic depletion category, contributing to over 70% of the total global warming potential (1023 kg CO(2) eq. per tonne of milk), 84% of the total photochemical oxidation potential (0.2 kg C(2)H(4) eq. per tonne of milk), 70% of the total acidification potential (20.4 kg SO(2) eq. per tonne of milk), and 41% of the total eutrophication potential (7.1 kg PO(4)(3-) eq. per tonne of milk). The production of concentrates and maize silage are the major contributors to the abiotic depletion category, accounting for 35% and 28%, respectively, of the overall abiotic depletion potential (4 Sb eq. per tonne of milk). Based on this LCA case study, we recommend further work to evaluate some possible opportunities to improve the environmental performance of Portuguese milk production, namely: (i) implementing integrated solutions for manure recovery/treatment (e.g. anaerobic digestion) before its application to the soil as organic fertiliser during maize and ryegrass production; (ii) improving manure nutrient use efficiency in order to decrease the importation of nutrients; (iii) diversifying feeding crops, as the dependence on two annual forage crops is expected to lead to excessive soil mobilisation (and related impacts) and to insignificant carbon dioxide sequestration from the atmosphere; and (iv) changing the concentrate mixtures.

"Thufur, 42-200 cm long and 9-27 cm high, are distributed in a summit crater of Mt Halla where freeze-thaw days occur over 70 times annually. The cryogenic mounds are frozen as a hard solid mass during winter and their lower part remains frozen until late April even though they begin to thaw in mid-March. Since the water content of thufur increases and exceeds a liquid limit during March and April, thufur soils may be subject to cryoturbation. An exfoliating terrace in a northwestern grassland of Mt Halla retreated at a rate of 22.2 mm/year from 2002 to 2004. Frost action is the process contributing most to turf exfoliation, with the maximum retreat rate observed from late March to early May. Thufur and turf exfoliation indicate that the subalpine grassland of Mt Halla is likely to be situated in a periglacial environment. However, global warming has affected these periglacial features through vegetation changes. The withering of alpine shrubs is partly responsible for the formation of crater-like thufur and subsequent rupture of thufur, while the rapid spread of Sasa quelpaertensis checks the retreat of turf terraces.",0
"A life cycle inventory analysis has been conducted to assess the environmental load, specifically CO2 (fossil) emissions and global warming potential (GWP), associated to the production of hydrogen by the steam reforming of hydrocarbon feedstocks (methane and naphtha) and vegetable oils (rapeseed oil, soybean oil and palm oil). Results show that the GWPs associated with the production of hydrogen by steam reforming in a 100 years time frame are 9.71 and 9.46 kg CO2-equivalent/kg H-2 for natural gas and naphtha, respectively. For vegetable oils, the GWP decreases to 6.42 kg CO2-equivalent/ kg H-2 for rapeseed oil, 4.32 for palm oil and 3.30 for soybean oil. A dominance analysis determined that the part of the process that has the largest effect on the GWP is the steam reforming reaction itself for the fossil fuel-based systems, which accounts for 56.7% and 74% of the total GWP for natural gas and naphtha, respectively. This contribution is zero for vegetable oil-based systems, for which harvesting and oil production are the main sources of CO2-eq emissions.",0
"STEP (solar thermal electrochemical production) theory is derived and experimentally verified for the electrosynthesis of energetic molecules at solar energy efficiency greater than any photovoltaic conversion efficiency. In STEP the efficient formation of metals, fuels, chlorine, and carbon capture is driven by solar thermal heated endothermic electrolyses of concentrated reactants occuring at a voltage below that of the room temperature energy stored in the products. One example is CO2, which is reduced to either fuels or storable carbon at a solar efficiency of over 50% due to a synergy of efficient solar thermal absorption and electrochemical conversion at high temperature and reactant concentration. CO2-free production of iron by STEP, from iron ore, occurs via Fe(III) in molten carbonate. Water is efficiently split to hydrogen by molten hydroxide electrolysis, and chlorine, sodium, and magnesium from molten chlorides. A pathway is provided for the STEP decrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to pre-industial age levels in 10 years.",0
"Amorphous fluorinated carbon (a-C:F) films with low-dielectric constant were,prepared using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) from C4F8 (octafluorocyclobutane) gas, C4F6 (hexafluoro-1,3-butadiene) gas, and C5F8 (octafluorocyclopentene) gas. C4F8 is now mainly used in ultra large scale integrated (ULSI) processes, and C4F6 are expected to be substitutional gases in these processes due to their low global warming potential (GWP). Here, the effect of C-CF bond ratio in a-C:F films on the dielectric constant and thermal stability of the films was studied. In all the films, both the orientational polarization and total dielectric constant decreased with decreasing C-CF bond ratio. High C-CF bond ratio of the film, however, resulted in higher residual film thickness after vacuum annealing. Based on these results, films with low dielectric constant that also have thermal and mechanical stability are difficult to achieve. Stable film properties, such as leakage current, at high temperature is not less related to the C-CF bond ratio than to the parent gas.",0
"Background: Understanding the factors that generate and maintain biodiversity is a central goal in ecology. While positive species interactions (i.e., facilitation) have historically been underemphasized in ecological research, they are increasingly recognized as playing important roles in the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. Dominant habitat-forming species (foundation species) buffer environmental conditions and can therefore facilitate myriad associated species. Theory predicts that facilitation will be the dominant community-structuring force under harsh environmental conditions, where organisms depend on shelter for survival and predation is diminished. Wind-swept, arid Patagonian rocky shores are one of the most desiccating intertidal rocky shores ever studied, providing an opportunity to test this theory and elucidate the context-dependency of facilitation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Surveys across 2100 km of southern Argentinean coastline and experimental manipulations both supported theoretical predictions, with 43 out of 46 species in the animal assemblage obligated to living within the matrices of mussels for protection from potentially lethal desiccation stress and predators having no detectable impact on diversity. Conclusions/Significance: These results provide the first experimental support of long-standing theoretical predictions and reveal that in extreme climates, maintenance of whole-community diversity can be maintained by positive interactions that ameliorate physical stress. These findings have important conservation implications and emphasize that preserving foundation species should be a priority in remediating the biodiversity consequences of global climate change.",0
"Life cycle assessments of bio-based polymer resin and products historically have shown favorable results in terms of environmental impacts and energy use compared to petroleum-based products. However, calculation of these impacts always depends on the system and boundary conditions considered during the study. This paper reports a cradle-to-cradle Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) in comparison with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(styrene) (PS) thermoformed clamshell containers, used for packaging of strawberries with emphasis on different end-of-life scenarios. It considers all the inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and seed corn required for the growing and harvesting of corn used for manufacturing PLA. For PET and PS, the extraction of crude oil and the entire cracking processes from crude oil through styrene and ethylene glycol and terephathalic acid are considered. Global warming, aquatic acidification, aquatic eutrophication, aquatic ecotoxicity, ozone depletion, non-renewable energy and respiratory organics, land occupation and respiratory inorganics were the selected midpoint impact categories. The geographical scope of the study reflects data from Europe, North America and the Middle East. PET showed the highest overall values for all the impact categories, mainly due to the higher weight of the containers. The main impacts to the environment were the resin production and the transportation stage of the resins and containers. This implies that the transportation stage of the package is an important contributor to the environmental impact of the packaging systems, and that it cannot be diminished. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"An attempt has been made to construct a novel economy-climate model by combining climate change research with agricultural economy research to evaluate the influence of global climate change on grain yields. The insertion of a climate change factor into the economic C-D (Cobb-Dauglas) production function model yields a novel evaluation model, which connects the climate change factor to the economic variation factor, and the performance and reasonableness of the novel evaluation model are also preliminarily simulated and verified.",0
"CO2 ocean sequestration is one of the promising options to reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere because the ocean has vast capacity for CO2 absorption. Therefore, in the present investigation, calculations for solubility and dissolution behavior of liquid CO2 droplets released at 1000 m and 1500 m deep in the ocean from a moving ship and a fixed pipeline have been carried out in order to estimate the CO2 dissolution characteristics in the ocean. The results show liquid CO2 becomes CO2 bubble at around 500 m in depth, and the solubility of seawater is about 5% less than of pure water. Also, it is shown that the injection of liquid CO2 from a moving ship is a more effective method for dissolution than from a fixed pipeline, and the presence of hydrate on liquid CO2 acts as a resistant layer in dissolving liquid CO2.",0
"We analyse the new ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) D2 cloud data to ascertain whether or not a connection between cosmic ray flux and cloud cover exists. Our results indicate that only the low-level cloud follows solar activity over the full period, 1983-1994. Using several proxies for solar activity and the radiative forcing for the ISCCP cloud types, we estimate the possible impact that such a solar-terrestrial connection may have on climate. We conclude that, possibly excluding the most recent decades, much of the warming of the past century can be quantitatively accounted for by the direct and indirect effects of solar activity.",0
"Major and trace elements as well as strontium isotopic composition have been analyzed on the acid-insoluble (Al) phase of the loess-paleosol sequence from Luochuan, Shaanxi Province, China. Results show that the chemical composition of Al phase of loess and paleosols is distinctive to the average composition of upper continental crust (UCC), characterized by depletion of mobile elements Na, Ca and Sr. The distribution pattern of elements in Al phase reveals that initial dust, derived from a vast area of Asian inland, has suffered from Na- and Ca-removed chemical weathering compared to UCC. Some geochemical parameters (such as CIA values, Na/K, Rb/Sr and Sr-87/Sr-88 ratios) display a regular variation and evolution, reflecting that the chemical weathering in the source region of loess deposits has decreased gradually since 2.5 Ma with the general increase of global ice volume. This coincidence reflects that the aridity of Asian inland since the Quaternary is a possible regional response to the global climate change.",0
"Late Palaeozoic glacigene deposits forming the base of the Gondwana megasequence are present along the entire length of the Tethyan margin of Gondwana. The lithology of the deposits in these sequences was controlled largely by the prevailing climate and this influence was imposed also upon early diagenesis. The change from the cold, glacial climate to the cool temperate, postglacial environment is reflected by a change from a mineralogically immature composition (arkosic chloritic) of the glacial periglacial sediments, to a mature, kaolinite pyrite quartz dominated lithofacies of the deglaciation deposits. A typical feature of the latter period is the appearance of black, kaolinitic lutites, usually with a high organic C content. From the many occurrences, only a few examples of typical deglaciation sequences are discussed in this paper, including Tanzania, southern Oman, the Lesser Himalaya, northwestern Australia and southwest China. Microflora and fauna demonstrate that all these deglaciation sequences are of Late Asselian to Early Sakmarian age, indicating that deglaciation along the Tethyan margin of Gondwana was, within the limit of the dating methods, a synchronuous event. A peak in sea level in the Late Sakmarian/Early Artinskian, experienced in all but one of the sections described, supports this statement. The high content of organic matter in the deglaciation deposits was caused by the sudden increase of bioproduction stimulated by higher temperatures and a high CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. A high input of organic material, combined with glacially overdeepened basin geometries, were responsible for the dominance of euxinic conditions during that period. The swift and synchronuous climatic amelioration cannot be explained by shifting pole positions, but only by rapid and substantial global warming. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Limited.

"Whether microevolution on small islands differs from that on larger landmasses is a key question in biology with substantial implications for species conservation. However, due to the difficulties faced in producing adequately replicated samples and in controlling for confounding variables, prior attempts to examine evolutionary questions relating to habitat area and population size have produced equivocal results. Here we show, using experimental design criteria that reduce the potential for such confounding, that bird species on larger landmasses have higher rates of molecular evolution. The study involves a global dataset of 48 independent contrasts for the cytochrome b gene encompassing all possible paired sister species comparisons (from seven orders and 17 families) that were available at the time of dataset assembly. A more rapid evolutionary tempo in larger areas has important ramifications for biodiversity conservation because it indicates a new imperative, beyond that of simply maintaining preexisting genetic diversity, for securing large areas for threatened species. This result suggests that the trend of confining species to limited refugia is likely to be slowing the tempo of microevolution. That effect might constrain the potential for adaptive shifts in response to changing environments such as those associated with global warming.",0
"Nation-wide phenological observations have been made in Switzerland since 195 In addition to these observation programmes, there are two very long phenological series in Switzerland: leaf bud burst of horse-chestnut trees has been observed in Geneva since 1808 and full flowering of cherry trees in Liestal since 1894. In addition to the presentation of these two long phenological series, trends for 896 phenological time series have been calculated with national data from 1951 to 1998. The earlier bud burst of horse-chestnut trees in Geneva can be attributed mainly to the city effect (warmth island). This phenomenon was not observed with the cherry tree flowering in Liestal. A clear trend towards earlier appearance dates in spring and a weak tendency towards later appearance dates in autumn could be shown with data from the national observation network. It must be noted that different phenophases and plant species react differently to various environmental influences.",0
"Effects of elevated temperature, in combination with exposure to the fungicide fenarimol, on reproduction in the deposit-feeding Baltic amphipod Monoporeia affinis were investigated. Previously, fenarimol was found to cause endocrine disruption in other crustacean species, via the ecdysteroid system. M. affinis were exposed to elevated temperature and/or fenarimol in soft-bottom microcosms during sexual maturation and mating. Elevated temperature and fenarimol (0.7 mg l(-1)) acted synergistically and increased the number of females with dead eggs, with a more than 4-fold incidence compared to exposure to one of the stressors (24 vs. < 5 %). Exposure to both stressors also resulted in a negative intrinsic rate of increase, which might indicate a population decline in the field. Elevated temperature impaired sexual maturation in males and females, lowered the number of fertilised females, reduced fecundity and altered embryogenesis. Exposure to fenarimol resulted in a 40 % decrease in ecdysteroid levels in sexually mature males and an increase in heat shock protein 60 expression. Ecdysteroid levels were not affected by temperature in either sex or stage of sexual maturation. Our results suggest that increase in the water temperature due to, e.g., global warming would impair reproduction and possibly increase the sensitivity of M affinis to toxicants.",0
"Global temperatures are rising, and are expected to produce a poleward shift in the distribution of many organisms. We quantified changes in fish assemblages within seagrass meadows of the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) between the 1970s and 2006-2007, and observed changes consistent with this forecast. During 2006-2007 we sampled seagrass meadows using the same gears and methods previously employed by R. J. Livingston in coastal waters of northwest Florida throughout the 1970s. Comparisons between datasets revealed numerous additions to the fish fauna during 2006-2007 that were completely absent in the 1970s, including: Lutjanus synagris (lane snapper), Epinephelus morio (red grouper), Chaetodon ocellatus (spotfin butterflyfish), Mycteroperca sp (grouper, non gag), Centropristis philadelphica (rock sea bass), Fistularia tabacaria (bluespotted cornetfish), Ocyurus chrysurus (yellowtail snapper), Thalassoma bifasciatum (bluehead wrasse), Abudefduf saxatilis (sergeant major), Acanthuridae spp. (surgeonfishes) and Sparisoma viride (stoplight parrotfish). Several other species showed large increases in abundance during the interval between 1979 and 2006, including Mycteroperca microlepis (gag grouper, up similar to 200 x), Lutjanus griseus (gray snapper, up similar to 105 x), and Nicholsina usta (emerald parrotfish, up similar to 22 x). All of these are tropical or subtropical species that now make up a greater percentage of seagrass-associated fish assemblages in the northern GOM than in the past. Additionally, we observed regional increases in air and sea surface temperatures (>3 degrees C) during the similar to 30 years that separate Livingston's samples and ours that correlate with northern shifts in the distribution of warm-water fishes. Documenting these range shifts is a critical first step in investigating the consequences of global warming for endemic marine communities and fishery production in the northern GOM.",0
"THROUGHOUT the Northern Hemisphere the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide rises in winter and declines in summer, mainly in response to the seasonal growth in land vegetation(1-4). In the far north the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, peak to trough, is between 15 and 20 parts per million by volume(5). The annual amplitude diminishes southwards to about 3 p.p.m. near the Equator, owing to the diminishing seasonality of plant activity towards the tropics. In spite of atmospheric mixing processes, enough spatial variability is retained in the seasonal cycle of CO2 to reveal considerable regional detail in seasonal plant activity(6). Here we report that the annual amplitude of the seasonal CO2 cycle has increased by 20%, as measured in Hawaii, and by 40% in the Arctic, since the early 1960s. These increases are accompanied by phase advances of about 7 days during the declining phase of the cycle, suggesting a lengthening of the growing season. In addition, the annual amplitudes show maxima which appear to reflect a sensitivity to global warming episodes that peaked in 1981 and 1990. We propose that the amplitude increases reflect increasing assimilation of CO2 by land plants in response to climate changes accompanying recent rapid increases in temperature.",0
"The retreat of glaciers in Iceland due to climate warming during the last century has resulted in changed hydrological conditions at glacial margins and in larger sandy areas. Subsequently, aeolian processes have become more active. The aim of this research was to study wind erosion south of Langjokull glacier and the development of encroaching sand, as well as the influence of macro and micro topography on the processes. Automatic instruments and aeolian dust traps were used to monitor wind erosion and to estimate its dependence on surface roughness. Digital elevation model was used to analyse the effect of macro topography on sand encroachment. The study indicates that large quantities of sand have moved southwards from the glacial moraine and drained lakes. The spatial distribution of the sand confirms a dominating aeolian transportation by northerly dry winds. The topography influences wind directions and the flux of aeolian materials. Threshold velocities (wind speed measured at 2m height) ranged from 6.2ms(-1) on level land to 10.7ms(-1) on rough surfaces. Flux can exceed 1000kg m(-1)hr(-1) at 17 m s(-1) wind speed. Slopes exceeding 7 per cent reduce or halt sand movement. Rough surfaces immobilize the aeolian material until accumulated material has leveled the surface, after that the flux continues. The intensified aeolian processes have buried previously vegetated areas and it is likely that continued glacier retreat due to climate warming will cause further land degradation in this area.

"The migratory behaviour of many bird species is currently changing, evidently in connection with global warming; in general there is a shift towards sedentariness. Because experimental studies indicate that all crucial aspects of migration are under direct genetic control, it is unlikely that the observed changes result from phenotypic plasticity. Equally improbable is the assumption of more numerous mutations in the same direction. Instead, the cause may well be rapid processes of selection and microevolution, which are demonstrable in the field and experimentally reproducible. An ideal initial situation for selection processes is partial migration. Such birds' genetic predisposition for both migration and nonmigration amounts to a kind of turntable, from which migrants, residents and partial migrants with various proportions of migratory and nonmigratory individuals can be selected. Partial migration is not only the most common Life form among birds, but is a widespread type of behaviour that developed early in the evolution of plants and animals. The new bird migration theory postulates that birds either evolved partial migration very early or inherited it from avian ancestors, like other characteristics of migration such as compasses and fat deposition. In any case, birds thus possess a fundamental control mechanism which, depending on the environmental situation, permits the rapid emergence of phenotypic migrants or residents or transitional mixed populations comprising various combinations of migrant and resident individuals. This simple new theory allows us to dispense with the previous concept that migratory birds arose polyphyletically from nonmigrants by mutational ""behavioural jumps""-a concept that cannot explain, for instance, the currently increased shift away from migratory behaviour.",0
"Natural wetlands form the largest source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Emission of this powerful greenhouse gas from wetlands is known to depend on climate, with increasing temperature and rainfall both expected to increase methane emissions. This study, combining our field and controlled environment manipulation studies in Europe and North America, reveals an additional control: an emergent pattern of increasing suppression of methane (CH4) emission from peatlands with increasing sulfate (SO42-S) 4 deposition, within the range of global acid deposition. We apply a model of this relationship to demonstrate the potential effect of changes in global sulfate deposition from 1960 to 2080 on both northern peatland and global wetland CH4 emissions. We estimate that sulfur pollution may currently counteract climate-induced growth in the wetland source, reducing CH4 emissions by approximate to15 Tg or 8% smaller than it would be in the absence of global acid deposition. Our findings suggest that by 2030 sulfur pollution may be sufficient to reduce CH4 emissions by 26 Tg or 15% of the total wetland source, a proportion as large as other components of the CH4 budget that have until now received far greater attention. We conclude that documented increases in atmospheric CH4 concentration since the late 19th century are likely due to factors other than the global warming of wetlands.",0
"Sand temperature can play an important role in the survival of pre-emergent sea turtle hatchlings. High sand temperatures may inhibit coordinated muscle action in the ascent process to the sand surface and also may cause a decline in oxygen levels within the nest. These factors can increase mortality of hatchlings prior to emergence. In this study we analyze the effects of sand temperature on pre-emergent Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas) hatchlings in Tortuguero, Costa Rica. We also analyze the relationship between sand temperature and egg incubation period, hatching success and hatchling emergence percentage. Nests were selected from June to August 2000, so that hatchlings would emerge during two distinct periods: a period of low temperatures and abundant rainfall mainly during August (wet period, WP) and a period of higher temperatures and lower rainfall mainly during September and early October (dry period, DP). Air and sand temperatures were significantly higher in the DP. Increases in sand temperature reduced incubation period from 58.6 +/- 0.6 days in the WP to 56.4 +/- 0.5 days in the DP. Mean hatching success and emergence percentage were 86 +/- 3% and 96 +/- 1%, respectively, and were not associated with the nest initiation date. However, a negative association was found between the emergence percentage and the mean sand temperature at 40 cm depth in the pre-emergence days. Pre-emergent hatchlings may experience increased mortality when sand temperatures at the egg chamber neck level exceed 33 degrees C. When one takes into account global warming projections, hatchling mortality during pre-emergence days could increase and pose a serious threat to this green sea turtle population.",0
"This paper deals with the influence of R12 working fluid replacements on energy efficiency and global warming expressed by values of Coefficient of Performance (COP) and Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI). Experimental investigations are presented which relate the use of refrigerants R134a, R401A, R409A, R22 and the mixture of R134a with R12 to the values of COP and TEWI of refrigerating system in comparison with R12 application. It is shown that the use of R134a, R401A and R409A refrigerants enables the increase of COP coefficient and significantly reduces the value of TEWI in comparison with R12 application.

"Geographic and ecological distributions of three Lutzomyia sand flies that are cutaneous leishmaniasis vectors in South America were analysed using ecological niche modelling. This new tool provides a large-scale perspective on species' geographic distributions, ecological and historical factors determining them, and their potential for change with expected environmental changes. As a first step, the ability of this technique to predict geographic distributions of the three species was tested statistically using two subsampling techniques: a random-selection technique that simulates 50% data density, and a quadrant-based technique that challenges the method to predict into broad unsampled regions. Predictivity under both test schemes was highly statistically significant. Visualisation of ecological niches provided insights into the ecological basis for distributional differences among species. Projections of potential geographic distributions across scenarios of global climate change suggested that only Lutzomyia whitmani is likely to be experiencing dramatic improvements in conditions in south-eastern Brazil, where cutaneous leishmaniasis appears to be re-emerging; Lutzomyia intermedia and Lutzomyia migonei may be seeing more subtle improvements in climatic conditions, but the implications are not straightforward. More generally, this technique offers the possibility of new views into the distributional ecology of disease, vector, and reservoir species. (C) 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

"We estimated recent growth of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Metahogrammus aeglefinus) larvae collected on the southern flank of Georges Bank in May 1992-94 from the ratio of RNA to DNA (RID) and water temperature. Growth of both species increased with water temperature to about 7degreesC and then decreased. The highest growth rates were observed in May 1993 at water temperatures around 7degreesC. These data confirm an earlier observation of comparable temperature optima for growth of Atlantic cod and haddock larvae in the north-West Atlantic. Comparisons of field growth rates and temperature optima with data for larvae cultured at high temperatures and prey densities in the laboratory suggest that growth may have been food-limited at higher temperatures on Georges Bank. Given that 7degreesC is the long-term mean water temperature on the southern flank in May and that climate models predict a possible 2-4degreesC rise in water temperatures for the western North Atlantic, our findings point to a possible adverse effect of global warming on Atlantic cod and haddock.",0
"In regions with severe winters, global warming may be expected to cause earlier onset of breeding in most animals, yet no documentation of such a trend exists in North America. In a study of marked individuals of the Mexican jay (Aphelocoma ultramarina) in southeastern Arizona, from 1971 to 1998, the mean Julian date of first clutch in the population declined significantly by 10.1 days. The date of the first nest in the population also became earlier, by 10.8 days. These changes were associated with significant trends toward increased monthly minimum temperatures on the study area, traits that are associated with the onset of breeding in this population, Significant trends from 1971 to 1997 toward warmer minimum temperatures in the months before and during the initiation of breeding were observed. These trends parallel changes in minimum temperatures and community composition in a recent study of grassland ecology in the western United States. Together, they suggest that more attention should be given to the possible ecological importance of global change in minimum temperatures.",0
"Greenland ice mass loss is one of the most serious phenomena of present-day global climate change. In this context, both the quantification of overall deglaciation rates and its spatial localization are highly significant. We have thoroughly investigated the technique of point-mass modeling in order to derive mass-balance patterns from GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) gravimetry. The method infers mass variations on the Earth's surface from gravitational signals at satellite altitude. In order to solve for point-mass changes, we applied least-squares adjustment. Due to downward continuation, numerical stabilization of the inversion process gains particular significance. We stabilized the ill-posed problem by Tikhonov regularization. Our simulation and real data experiments show that point-mass modeling provides both rational deglaciation rates and high-resolution spatial mass variation patterns.",0
"To understand the characteristics of the diurnal variation in soil respiration and its response to temperature, we used root exclusion plots, and buried CO(2) sensors in situ during the late growing season in northwestern China. Soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition and root respiration dynamics were quantified. In our study, we found that the diurnal variations in root respiration and soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition showed a contrasting diurnal pattern. SOC decomposition peaked in the afternoon and was in phase with an increase in soil temperature at 10 cm; whereas root respiration decreased from similar to 08:00-09:00 and was minimal at similar to 17:00-18:00 despite an increase in soil temperature. Furthermore, an exponential function explained the diurnal variation in total soil respiration and SOC decomposition (r(2) > 0.6, n = 504), but not so for root respiration (r(2) < 0.3, n = 504). The fitted Q (10) value of 4.3 for SOC decomposition was significantly higher than the Q (10) value of 3.1 for root respiration. This result suggested that the root respiration rate had a different temperature sensitivity to the microbial respiration rate. In addition, we observed a significant (p < 0.001) clockwise hysteretic effect for SOC decomposition with respect to soil temperature at 10 cm over a 24 h period, with higher rates when soil temperature was increasing and lower rates when soil temperature was decreasing. By contrast, the diurnal hysteresis in root respiration with soil temperature at 10 cm was always counter-clockwise, with lower rates when soil temperature was increasing than when soil temperature was decreasing. This study emphasizes that root respiration and SOC decomposition have different responses to changing soil temperature. Therefore, modeling the impact of global climate change on soil carbon efflux should consider simultaneously, but separately, the impact of the two components.",0
"Based on monthly averaged surface air temperature data of 733 stations in China during 1951 2002, after rejecting 86 stations in the large cities, we analyze the consistencies and differences of the trends in surface air temperatures over eastern, western China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and discuss their causes. The results show that there are close connections and consistency in variations of annual and seasonal mean surface air temperatures in eastern and western China. Warming trends are all significant in eastern and western China with a rate of 0.26 degrees C/10a in eastern China and 0.18 degrees C/10a in western China, respectively. Seasonally, mean temperatures also tended warm but the warmest trends appeared in winter in both eastern and western China. The annual mean warming trend in eastern China is more obvious than that in western China. In winter and spring, warming trends in eastern China are greater than those in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and western China, while in summer and autumn they are smaller in eastern China. The consistency of warming trends in eastern and western China suggests that surface air temperatures in both eastern and western China are influenced by global warming background. Whereas, the fact that the warming trend in eastern China is more obvious than that in western China implies that topography also plays an important role in regional temperature variations.",0
"The release of vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere as a result of clathrate destabilization is a potential mechanism for rapid amplification of global warming. Previous studies have calculated the enhanced warming based mainly on the radiative effect of the methane itself, with smaller contributions from the associated carbon dioxide or ozone increases. Here, we study the effect of strongly elevated methane (CH(4)) levels on oxidant and aerosol particle concentrations using a combination of chemistry-transport and general circulation models. A 10-fold increase in methane concentrations is predicted to significantly decrease hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations, while moderately increasing ozone (O(3)). These changes lead to a 70% increase in the atmospheric lifetime of methane, and an 18% decrease in global mean cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC). The CDNC change causes a radiative forcing that is comparable in magnitude to the long-wave radiative forcing (""enhanced greenhouse effect"") of the added methane. Together, the indirect CH(4)-O(3) and CH(4)-OHaerosol forcings could more than double the warming effect of large methane increases. Our findings may help explain the anomalously large temperature changes associated with historic methane releases.",0
"Seasonal patterns of climate and vegetation growth are expected to be altered by global warming. In alpine environments, the reproduction of birds and mammals is tightly linked to seasonality; therefore such alterations may have strong repercussions on recruitment. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a satellite-based measurement that correlates strongly with aboveground net primary productivity, to explore how annual variations in the timing of vegetation onset and in the rate of change in primary production during green-up affected juvenile growth and survival of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in four different populations in two continents. We indexed timing of onset of vegetation growth by the integrated NDVI (INDVI) in May. The rate of change in primary production during green-up ( early May to early July) was estimated as ( 1) the maximal slope between any two successive bimonthly NDVI values during this period and ( 2) the slope in NDVI between early May and early July. The maximal slope in NDVI was negatively correlated with lamb growth and survival in both populations of bighorn sheep, growth of mountain goat kids, and survival of Alpine ibex kids, but not with survival of mountain goat kids. There was no effect of INDVI in May and of the slope in NDVI between early May and early July on juvenile growth and survival for any species. Although rapid changes in NDVI during the green-up period could translate into higher plant productivity, they may also lead to a shorter period of availability of high-quality forage over a large spatial scale, decreasing the opportunity for mountain ungulates to exploit high-quality forage. Our results suggest that attempts to forecast how warmer winters and springs will affect animal population dynamics and life histories in alpine environments should consider factors influencing the rate of changes in primary production during green-up and the timing of vegetation onset.",0
"Data and computer simulations are reviewed to help better define the timing and magnitude of human influence on sediment flux-the Anthropocene epoch. Impacts on the Earth surface processes are not spatially or temporally homogeneous. Human influences on this sediment flux have a secondary effect on floodplain and delta-plain functions and sediment dispersal into the coastal ocean. Human impact on sediment production began 3000 years ago but accelerated more widely 1000 years ago. By the sixteenth century, societies were already engineering their environment. Early twentieth century mechanization has led to global signals of increased sediment flux in most large rivers. By the 1950s, this sediment disturbance signal reversed for many rivers owing to the proliferation of dams, and sediment load reduction below pristine conditions is the dominant signal today. A delta subsidence signal began in the 1930s and is now a dominant signal in terms of sea level for many coastal environments, overwhelming even the global warming imprint on sea level. Humans have engineered how most water and sediment are discharged into the coastal ocean. Hyperpycnal flow events have become more common for some rivers, and less common for other rivers. Bottom trawling is now widespread, suggesting that even continental shelves have received a significant but as yet quantified Anthropocene impact. The Anthropocene attains the level of a geological climate event, such as that seen in the transition between the Pleistocene and the Holocene.",0
"Earlier spring onset and the associated extension of the growing season in high latitudes belong to the most obvious consequences of global warming. The natural dynamics of growing-season properties during past climate shifts however, are extremely difficult to reconstruct since temperature reconstructions are hardly ever seasonally resolved and the applied proxies such as chirinomid or pollen analysis are mainly sensitive to summer temperatures. Here we apply a newly developed leaf cuticle-based proxy to reconstruct growing degree-days (GOD) in a quantitative way and to estimate changes in the timing of spring onset over the last deglaciation. Cuticle analyses of fossil birch leaves preserved in lake sediments from southern Germany reveal extremely low GDD values during the Late Pleniglacial, which are rapidly increasing at the onset of the Bolling/Allerod interstadial. While temperature and GDDs show a simultaneous warming during deglaciation, a GDD decline precedes lowering of summer temperatures during the Older Dryas cooling. Later bud-burst dates support the hypothesis of a shortening the growing season during this cool pulse. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Emission of organochlorine chemicals in urban, agricultural and industrial regions of the world has resulted in a substantial influx to the Canadian Arctic. Long-range atmospheric transport and what has been referred to as 'global distillation' transport many chemicals from warm source areas to cold, polar regions. Organochlorines are detected in Arctic air, water, and snow, with substantial accumulations in animals, marine mammals, and humans. This has led to concern regarding health effects to native people who consume traditional foods. Speculations on future trends of organochlorines in the Arctic is presented and related to global warming effects and the physical chemistry of the compounds of interest. It is conceivable that high levels of certain contaminants in the Arctic environment may persist for decades despite recent reductions in global emissions.",0
"We used Tasmania as a case example to question the consensus that few marine species have recently become extinct or are approaching extinction. Threats to marine and estuarine species primarily in the form of climate change, invasive species, fishing, and catchment discharges-are accelerating, fully encompass species ranges, and are of sufficient magnitude to cause extinction. Our ignorance of declining biodiversity in the marine environment largely results from an almost complete lack of systematic broad-scale sampling and an overreliance on physicochemical data to monitor environmental trends. Population declines for marine species approaching extinction will generally go unnoticed because of the hidden nature of their environment and lack of quantitative data.",0
"Devastating magnitudes of flood disasters have been occurring in various areas of Japan, and their impact has been increasing in recent years. Looking ahead, it is foreseen that rainfall and its patterns will be altered due to the climate change accompanied by global warming, and there is concern that the intensity and frequency of flood disasters might be exacerbated. This paper aims to introduce flood characteristics and management policies in Japan that have been undertaken for a long time in order to mitigate these recurrent flood disasters. It also highlights extremely devastating floods in some areas that occurred under recent climate variability, and to address the progress in the assessment of hydro-meteorological tendencies and in the promotion of dialogue among climatologists and hydrologists. Lastly, a new initiative to establish an international centre on water-related hazards and its risk management is presented.",0
"Mass mortality events of benthic invertebrates in the temperate north-western (NW) Mediterranean Sea have been observed in recent seasons. A 16 month in situ study in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea) demonstrated that the occurrence of Paramuricea clavata mortality episodes were concomitant to a condition of prolonged high sea surface temperatures, low chlorophyll concentrations and the presence of culturable Vibrio spp. in seawater. The occurrence of Vibrio spp. at the seasonal scale was correlated with temperature; with few vibrios retrieved on specific media when the temperature dropped below 18 degrees C and a sharp increase of vibrios abundance (up to 3.4 x 10(4) MPN I(-1)) when the temperature was greater than or equal to 22 degrees C. Phylogenetic and phenotypic analysis of Vibrio isolates associated with healthy and diseased P clavata colonies collected during a mortality episode showed that these bacteria were significantly more abundant in diseased than in healthy corals and were related to the V. harveyi, V. splendidus and V. coralliilyticus groups, the latter only identified in diseased organisms. Inoculation of bacterial isolates from these groups onto healthy P. clavata in aquaria caused disease signs and death in a range of Vibrio concentrations, temperature values and trophic conditions consistent with those recorded in the field. It is concluded that Vibrio infections may act as an additional triggering mechanism of mass mortality events in the coastal Mediterranean Sea and that their occurrence is climate-linked. Predicted global warming leading to long-lasting hot summer periods together with stratification resulting in energetic constraints represent a major threat to the survival of benthic invertebrates in the temperate NW Mediterranean Sea due to potential disease outbreak associated with Vibrio pathogens.",0
"Northern peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle representing a significant stock of soil carbon and a substantial natural source of atmospheric methane (CH(4)). Peatland carbon cycling is affected by water table position which is predicted to be lowered by climate change. Therefore we compared carbon fluxes along a natural peatland microtopographic gradient ( control) to an adjacent microtopographic gradient with an experimentally lowered water table ( experimental) during three growing seasons to assess the impact of water table drawdown on peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange. Water table drawdown induced peat subsidence and a change in the vegetation community at the experimental site. This limited differences in carbon dioxide (CO(2)) exchange between the control and experimental sites resulting in no significant differences between sites after three seasons. However, there was a trend to higher respiration rates and increased productivity in low-lying zones (hollows) and this was coincident with increased vegetation cover at these plots. In general, CH(4) efflux was reduced at the experimental site, although CH(4) efflux from control and experimental hollows remained similar throughout the study. The differential response of carbon cycling to the water table drawdown along the microtopographic gradient resulted in local topographic high zones ( hummocks) experiencing a relative increase in global warming potential (GWP) of 152%, while a 70% reduction in GWP was observed at hollows. Thus the distribution and composition of microtopographic elements, or microforms, within a peatland is important for determining how peatland carbon cycling will respond to climate change.",0
"Results from eight ocean-atmosphere general circulation models are used to evaluate the influence of the projected changes in the oceanic stratification on the first baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation in the ocean, associated with atmospheric CO2 increase. For each of the models, an oceanic state corresponding to the A1B stabilization experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of 720 ppm) is compared to a state corresponding to the preindustrial control experiment (with atmospheric CO2 concentration of 280 ppm). In all of the models, the first baroclinic Rossby radius increases with increasing oceanic stratification in the warmer climate. There is, however, a considerable range among the models in the magnitude of the increase. At the latitudes of intense eddy activity associated with instability of western boundary currents (around 35 degrees-40 degrees), the increase reaches 4 km on average, or about 15% of the local baroclinic Rossby radius. Some of the models predict an increase of the baroclinic Rossby radius by more than 20% at these latitudes under the applied forcing. It is therefore suggested that in a plausible future warmer climate, the characteristic length scale of mesoscale eddies, as well as boundary currents and fronts, may increase. In addition, since the speed of long baroclinic Rossby waves is proportional to the squared baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, the results suggest that the time scale for large-scale dynamical oceanic adjustment may decrease in the warmer climate, thereby increasing the frequency of long-term climate variability where the oceanic Rossby wave dynamics set the dominant period. Finally, the speed of equatorial Kelvin waves and Rossby waves, carrying signals along the equator, including those related to ENSO, is projected to increase.",0
"Many Holarctic bird species have been shown to be laying progressively earlier in response to global warming. Most studies have been conducted on small-bodied species at northern latitudes. In Italy, black kite Milvus migrans populations are concentrated near large pre-Alpine lakes, whose water temperatures have been increasing steadily in recent decades. Annual black kite laying dates have become 10-11 days earlier during the last nine years. This shift was related to temporal variations in spring air temperatures, with earlier laying in warmer springs. The progressive advancement in laying dates was not associated with an increase in population level productivity, despite the fact that productivity declined with laying date at the individual territory level within years. Avian response to climate change may be occurring more rapidly than previously thought, even in relatively long-lived species, and not only at the most northern latitudes or highest elevations. Because this change has occurred so rapidly, and because laying dates match annual variations in spring temperatures, the response must be facultatively driven by prevailing conditions, rather than genetic in response to natural selection.",0
"The primary production in the Greenland Sea, Fram Strait, Barents Sea, Kara Sea and adjacent Polar Ocean was investigated through the physically-biologically coupled, nested 3D SINMOD model with 4 km grid size for the years 1995-2007. The model had atmospheric forcing from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data. Three basic gross primary production (GPP) domains were distinguished: (i) an extensive domain dominated by Atlantic Water, (ii) an elongated domain roughly corresponding to the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) and (iii) a compact perennial ice zone (> 100, between 100 and 30 and < 30 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively). The interannual coefficient of variation for GPP in domain (i) was < 0.1, and increased northwards towards > 0.6 in the northwesternmost and northeasternmost fringe of the SIZ. The primary production in the northern sector of the European Arctic Corridor (EAC) region prior to 2007 was characterised by limited interannual variability, on average 75.2 +/- A 10% and 24.0 +/- A 16% g C m(-2) year(-1) for the EAC region at 74-80 and > 80A degrees N, respectively. The main primary production anomalies were found early in the productive season and in sections of the SIZ, generally in regions with low GPP. There was no significant trend of increasing GPP in the 1995-2007 time interval.",0
"Global climate change may reduce leaf area in crop plants due to factors such as increasing occurrence of pests and diseases. The aim of this work was to estimate the impact of leaf area reduction on agronomic traits in corn. An experiment simulating leaf area reduction was carried out in a tropical region of Brazil. The agronomic performance of corn plants was evaluated at different percentages of leaf loss. It was observed that leaf area reductions over 401% significantly harm yield, mass of 1000 grains, cob density, and stem and root quality Crop improvement programs should take into account the development of genotypes resistant to factors that cause leaf area reduction in tropical crops.",0
"Climate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution of wildfire, a complex abiotic process that responds to a variety of spatial and environmental gradients. How future climate change may alter global wildfire activity, however, is still largely unknown. As a first step to quantifying potential change in global wildfire, we present a multivariate quantification of environmental drivers for the observed, current distribution of vegetation fires using statistical models of the relationship between fire activity and resources to burn, climate conditions, human influence, and lightning flash rates at a coarse spatiotemporal resolution (100 km, over one decade). We then demonstrate how these statistical models can be used to project future changes in global fire patterns, highlighting regional hotspots of change in fire probabilities under future climate conditions as simulated by a global climate model. Based on current conditions, our results illustrate how the availability of resources to burn and climate conditions conducive to combustion jointly determine why some parts of the world are fire-prone and others are fire-free. In contrast to any expectation that global warming should necessarily result in more fire, we find that regional increases in fire probabilities may be counter-balanced by decreases at other locations, due to the interplay of temperature and precipitation variables. Despite this net balance, our models predict substantial invasion and retreat of fire across large portions of the globe. These changes could have important effects on terrestrial ecosystems since alteration in fire activity may occur quite rapidly, generating ever more complex environmental challenges for species dispersing and adjusting to new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the potential for widespread impacts of climate change on wildfire, suggesting severely altered fire regimes and the need for more explicit inclusion of fire in research on global vegetation-climate change dynamics and conservation planning.",0
"We present palaeomagnetic and cosmogenic radionuclide records of the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion in Lake Pupuke, a maar lake in Auckland, New Zealand. Laschamp was identified by a combination of relative palaeointensity, (10)Be and (14)C data from the lake sediments and represents the first such record from the Southern Hemisphere. Despite the high organic carbon content, which causes relatively weak natural remanent magnetisations, the geomagnetic intensity minimum associated with the Laschamp excursion is identifiable as a relative palaeointensity minimum that is synchronous with (i) a peak in (10)Be concentration and (ii) an anomaly in Delta(14)C. The Lake Pupuke time scale, provided by (14)C data calibrated with INTCAL09, places the (10)Be maximum at the same time as a (10)Be maximum in Greenland ice cores when secured to the GICC05 time scale. The central age of the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion in Lake Pupuke as defined by the (10)Be prediction peak is c. 41 kyr, which confirms its global application as a palaeomagnetic isochron. Anomalous palaeomagnetic directional data at c. 32 kyr in the Lake Pupuke sediments may represent the Mono Lake geomagnetic excursion, but tephra layers caused by frequent eruptions in the Auckland volcanic field during this excursion probably disrupted the palaeointensity signal. The study highlights the value of combining traditional palaeomagnetic methods with measurements of cosmogenic radionuclides in the quest for accurate and precise geochronologies during MIS3, a time of rapid global climate change.

"This study analyzed the environmental impacts of a single-story residential building using different exterior wall systems. The environmental impacts over the complete life cycle of the residential buildings were determined and compared using the following indicators: air pollution index, energy consumption (embodied and operational), global warming potential, resource use, solid waste emissions, and water pollution index. The exterior wall systems analyzed were concrete block, poured in-place concrete, insulated concrete, traditional 0.05 mx0.1 m by 0.4 m (2 in.x4 in. by 16 in.) on center wood frame, traditional 0.05 mx0.15 m by 0.6 m (2 in.x6 in. by 24 in.) on center wood frame, and steel stud framing. Additionally, structural insulated panels were modeled for the operational energy of the building. For each scenario, the designs were based on the minimum R value required by the International Building Code. ATHENA, a life-cycle assessment software tool, and eQuest, an energy usage modeling software tool that calculated the operational energy of the building, were used to evaluate the environmental impacts of the building, during the construction, use, and end of life phases, for each scenario. The results show that in the preuse phase, the insulated concrete buildings produce the greatest impact on the environment followed by the concrete block, poured in-place concrete, and steel stud buildings. Traditional wood frames had the fewest environmental impacts when considering only the preuse phase. In the use phase, the insulated concrete buildings had the lowest impacts to the environment because they required less operational energy, whereas concrete block, poured in-place concrete, traditional 0.05 mx0.15 m by 0.6 m (2 in.x6 in. by 24 in.) on center wood frame, traditional 0.05 mx0.1 m by 0.4 m (2 in.x4 in. by 16 in.) on center wood frame, and steel stud framing had progressively larger environmental impacts. The end of life phase was negligible with respect to the other phases. In the complete life-cycle assessment (LCA), 50-year life span, insulated concrete exterior walls used around 700 GJ (5%) less energy than traditional wood 0.05 mx0.15 m by 0.6 m (2 in.x6 in. by 24 in.) on center wall systems. The results also indicate the importance of exterior wall's thermal mass for the energy performance of a building, especially for a city located in a hot climate zone such as Phoenix, Arizona, and the importance of a holistic approach, such as LCA, to properly assess the negative environmental impact of different technologies.",0
"To study how global warming and eutrophication affect water ecosystems, a multiplicative growth Monod model, modified by incorporating the Arrhenius equation, was applied to Lake Taihu to quantitatively study the relationships between algal biomass and both nutrients and temperature using long-term data. To qualitatively assess which factor was a limitation of the improved model, temperature variables were calculated using annual mean air temperature (AT), water temperature (WT), and their average temperature (ST), while substrate variables were calculated using annual mean total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and their weighted aggregate (R), respectively. The nine fitted curves showed that TN and AT were two important factors influencing algal growth; AT limited growth as algal photosynthesis is mainly carried out near the water surface; N leakage of phytoplankton and internal phosphorus load from sediment explains why TN was the best predictor of peak biomass using the Monod model. The fitted results suggest that annual mean algal biomass increased by 0.145 times when annual mean AT increased by 0 degrees C. Results also showed that the more eutrophic the lake, the greater the effect AT had on algal growth. Subsequently, the long-term joint effect of annual temperature increase and eutrophication to water ecosystems can be quantitatively assessed and predicted.",0
"The effect of model resolution on projected climatological features of tropical cyclones (TCs) was investigated via 25-year present-day and future global warming projections using the Japan Meteorological Agency/Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model with four resolutions ranging from TL95 (180-km mesh) to TL959 (20-km mesh). The finest resolution (TL959) showed the highest skills in terms of TC intensity and interannual and seasonal variations in TC genesis number. Resolutions of TL319 (60-km mesh) and finer showed a significant future increase in the frequency of intense TCs, whereas resolutions coarser than TL319 showed no such change, indicating that TL319 is the critical resolution in projecting future change in the frequency of intense TCs. Overall, high model resolution is preferable for realistic and reliable climate projections. Resolutions of TL159 (120-km mesh) and finer showed similar skills, biases, and future changes in the spatial pattern of TC genesis frequency (TGF) and TC genesis number, indicating the potential use of lower model resolutions for minimizing uncertainties in future changes in the mean state of TGF and TC genesis number.",0
"Climate in mainland China can be divided into the monsoon region in the southeast and the westerly region in the northwest as well as the intercross zone, i.e.,the monsoon northernmost marginal active zone that is oriented from Southwest China to the upper Yellow River, North China, and Northeast China. In the three regions, dry-wet climate changes are directly linked to the interaction of the southerly monsoon flow on the east side of the Tibetan Plateau and the westerly flow on the north side of the Plateau from the inter-annual to inter-decadal timescales. Some basic features of climate variability in the three regions for the last half century and the historical hundreds of years are reviewed in this paper. In the last half century, an increasing trend of summer precipitation associated with the enhancing westerly flow is found in the westerly region from Xinjiang to northern parts of North China and Northeast China. On the other hand, an increasing trend of summer precipitation along the Yangtze River and a decreasing trend of summer precipitation along the monsoon northernmost marginal active zone are associated with the weakening monsoon flow in East Asia. Historical documents are widely distributed in the monsoon region for hundreds of years and natural climate proxies are constructed in the non-monsoon region, while two types of climate proxies can be commonly found over the monsoon northernmost marginal active zone. In the monsoon region, dry-wet variation centers are altered among North China, the lower Yangtze River, and South China from one century to another. Dry or wet anomalies are firstly observed along the monsoon northernmost marginal active zone and shifted southward or southeastward to the Yangtze River valley and South China in about a 70-year timescale. Severe drought events are experienced along the monsoon northernmost marginal active zone during the last 5 centuries. Inter-decadal dry-wet variations are depicted by natural proxies for the last 4-5 centuries in several areas over the non-monsoon region. Some questions, such as the impact of global warming on dry-wet regime changes in China, complex interactions between the monsoon and westerly flows in Northeast China, and the integrated multi-proxy analysis throughout all of China, are proposed.",0
"Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on our planet. Scleractinian corals function as the primary reef ecosystem engineers, constructing the framework that serves as a habitat for all other coral reef-associated organisms. However, the coral's engineering role is particularly susceptible to global climate change. Ocean warming can cause extensive mass coral bleaching, which triggers dysfunction of major engineering processes. Sub-lethal bleaching results in the reduction of both primary productivity and coral calcification. This may lead to changes in the release of organic and inorganic products, thereby altering critical biogeochemical and recycling processes in reef ecosystems. Thermal stress-induced bleaching and subsequent coral mortality, along with ocean acidification, further lead to long-term shifts in benthic community structure, changes in topographic reef complexity, and the modification of reef functioning. Such shifts may cause negative feedback loops and further modification of coral-derived inorganic and organic products. This review emphasises the critical role of scleractinian corals as reef ecosystem engineers and highlights the control of corals over key reef ecosystem goods and services, including high biodiversity, coastal protection, fishing, and tourism. Thus, climate change by impeding coral ecosystem engineers will impair the ecosystem functioning of entire reefs.",0
"Understanding the ecological impacts of climate change is a crucial challenge of the twenty-first century. There is a clear lack of general rules regarding the impacts of global warming on biota. Here, we present a metaanalysis of the effect of climate change on body size of ectothermic aquatic organisms (bacteria, phyto- and zooplankton, and fish) from the community to the individual level. Using long-term surveys, experimental data and published results, we show a significant increase in the proportion of small-sized species and young age classes and a decrease in size-at-age. These results are in accordance with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature-size relationships (i.e., Bergmann's rule, James' rule and Temperature-Size Rule). Our study provides evidence that reduced body size is the third universal ecological response to global warming in aquatic systems besides the shift of species ranges toward higher altitudes and latitudes and the seasonal shifts in life cycle events.",0
"The 2D/3D cloud model complex with explicit microphysics and radiation described in Part I is used to simulate the development of a midlatitude cirrus cloud? including interaction with radiation. To account for the effects of the interaction of various scales of motion on cloud development, a synoptic-scale vertical velocity field is superimposed on the mesoscale velocity field generated by the model, mimicking the effects of an upper-level shortwave trough. The main results under the conditions simulated here are the following. Cirrus cloud growth is much slower than assumed previously, because the process of vapor deposition to ice crystals is far from instantaneous: the crystal phase relaxation time (i.e., the characteristic time of vapor absorption by crystals) takes 0.5-2.0 h. Even after 1 h of cloud development, supersaturation with respect to ice can remain 5%-10%, while the condensed ice is only 40%-60% of the amount that would be realized assuming that all excess vapor is transformed into ice in typical model time steps. Although experimental and theoretical studies have produced widely divergent longwave mass absorption coefficients alpha(m)(abs), ranging from 100 to 3500 cm(2) g(-1), model results show that a single ""representative"" value of alpha(m)(abs) is inappropriate. Vertical profiles typically exhibit values of similar to 800-1000 cm(2) g(-1) in the upper cloud region containing the smallest particles, in contrast to similar to 100-300 cm(2) g(-1) for the larger crystals in the main cloud. The optical scattering coefficients behave similarly, with typical values of similar to 2000-2500 cm(2) g(-1) in the upper cloud regions and similar to 300-500 cm(2) g(-1) in the lower cloud regions. A strong horizontal variability is also a characteristic feature of these coefficients. Many GCM and climate models use seemingly overestimated alpha(m)(abs) values (e.g., 1000 cm(2) g(-1)). Sensitivity tests show that the use of such values increases cooling in the upper cloud and heating in the lower cloud, which can lead to an unwarranted increase in upper-tropospheric static instability. The postulated effects of the positive feedbacks between clouds and greenhouse gas-induced global warming would likely be different in magnitude (or in sign) if the more realistic approach of using cloud microstructure-dependent absorption and scattering coefficients could be adopted. Consideration of microphysics also shows that the decrease in the shortwave radiative balance (albedo effect) in the simulated midlatitude cirrus cloud exceeds the net gain in the longwave balance (greenhouse effect) near midday, due to the abundance of relatively small crystals in the upper cloud region where cloud regeneration is taking place.",0
"Simulated daily discharge derived front a relatively high-resolution (approximately 1-degree) general Circulation model was used to investigate Future projections of extremes in river discharge Under global warming. The frequency of floods was projected to increase over many regions, except those including North America and central to western Eurasia. The drought frequency was projected to increase globally, while regions such as northern high latitudes, eastern Australia, and eastern Eurasia showed a decrease or no significant changes. Changes in flood and drought are not explained simply by changes in annual precipitation, heavy precipitation, or differences between precipitation and evapotranspiration. Several regions were projected to have increases in both flood frequency and drought frequency. Such regions show a decrease in the number of precipitation days, but an increase in days with heavy rain. Several regions show shifts in the flood season from springtime snowmelt to the summer period of heavy precipitation.",0
"Background, Aims and Scope. During the combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW), energy is produced which can be utilized to generate electricity. However, electricity production from incineration has to be evaluated from the point view of the environmental performance. In this study, environmental impacts of electricity production from waste incineration plant in Thailand are compared with those from Thai conventional power plants. Methods. The evaluation is based on a life cycle perspective using life cycle assessment (LCA) as the evaluation tool. Since MSW incineration provides two services, viz., waste management and electricity production, the conventional power production system is expanded to include landfilling without energy recovery, which is the most commonly used waste management system in Thailand, to provide the equivalent function of waste management. Results. The study shows that the incineration performs better than conventional power plants vis-a-vis global warming and photochemical ozone formation, but not for acidification and nutrient enrichment. Discussion. There are some aspects which may influence this result. If landfilling with gas collection and flaring systems is included in the analysis along with conventional power production instead of landfilling without energy recovery, the expanded system could become more favorable than the incineration in the global warming point of view. In addition, if the installation of deNO(x) process is employed in the MSW incineration process, nitrogen dioxide can be reduced with a consequent reduction of acidification and nutrient enrichment potentials. However, the conventional power plants still have lower acidification and nutrient enrichment potentials. Conclusions. The study shows that incineration could not play the major role for electricity production, but in addition to being a waste management option, could be considered as a complement to conventional power production. To promote incineration as a benign waste management option, appropriate deNO(x) and dioxin removal processes should be provided. Separation of high moisture content waste fractions from the waste to be incinerated and improvement of the operation efficiency of the incineration plant must be considered to improve the environmental performance of MSW incineration. Recommendations. This study provides an overall picture and impacts, and hence, can support a decision-making process for implementation of MSW incineration. The results obtained in this study could provide valuable information to implement incineration. But it should be noted that the results show the characteristics only from some viewpoints. Outlook. Further analysis is required to evaluate the electricity production of the incineration plant from other environmental aspects such as toxicity and land-use.",0
"InfoCrop, a generic crop model, simulates the effects of weather, soils, agronomic management (planting, nitrogen, residues and irrigation) and major pests on crop growth, yield, soil carbon, nitrogen and water, and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents results of its evaluation in terms of its validation for rice and wheat crops in contrasting agro-environments of tropics, sensitivity to the key inputs, and also illustrates two typical applications of the model. Eleven diverse field experiments, having treatments of location, seasons, varieties, nitrogen management, organic matter, irrigation, and multiple pest incidences were used for validation. Grain yields in these experiments varied from 2.8 to 7.2 ton ha(-1) in rice and from 3.6 to 5.5 ton ha(-1) in wheat. The results indicated that the model was generally able to explain the differences in biomass, grain yield, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides, and long-term trends in soil organic carbon, in diverse agro-environments. The losses in dry matter and grain yield due to different pests and their populations were also explained satisfactorily. There were some discrepancies in the simulated emission of these gases during first few days after sowing/transplanting possibly because of the absence of tillage effects in the model. The sensitivity of the model to change in ambient temperature, crop duration and pest incidence was similar to the available field knowledge. The application of the model to quantify multiple pests damage through iso-loss curves is demonstrated. Another application illustrated is the use of InfoCrop for analyzing the trade-offs between increasing crop production, agronomic management strategies, and their global warming potential.

"We have synchronized records of ice-rafted rock debris deposits of three sediment cores from the Norwegian Sea and the Irminger Basin during the last glacial period from 10 to 50 ka by combining the use of radiocarbon dates and adjustments of physical properties. Our synchronized records indicate that layers rich in ice-rafted debris were deposited throughout the Nordic regions at times near to synchronous with the major collapses of the Laurentide ice sheet: during the Heinrich events. There are also millennial-scale, coherent and near to synchronous deposits of ice-rafted rock debris into the Norwegian Sea related to repetitive changes of the flux of icebergs from the Fenno-Scandinavian. The correlation with the cold phases of the Dansgaard-Oeschger temperature record points to a close coupling between atmospheric temperature oscillations and variations of iceberg fluxes into the Norwegian Sea during the last glacial. Variations in atmospheric circulation patterns bringing moisture supply to high latitudes and the distribution of this moisture over the different Northern Hemisphere coastal ice sheets and ice shelves could be controlling both the timing of ice sheet advances and the flux of iceberg to the open ocean.

"Forest gap models have been used widely in the study of forest dynamics, including predicting long-term succession patterns and assessing the potential impacts of climate change on forest structure and composition. However, little effort is devoted to predict forest dynamics in the high elevation areas, although they have the sensitive response to global climate change. In the present study, based on a modified height-diameter function, we developed a new version (FAREAST-GFSM) of the forest patch model, FAREAST for simulating the changes of subalpine forests. The observed data from the Gongga Mt. Alpine Station were also used to test model precision. With the improved performance of FAREAST-GFSM, we explored the impact of three warming scenarios on subalpine forest on the eastern Tibetan plateau within a 100-year period. The study result indicates that the effects of climate change were evident on subalpine forests in the high elevation areas. The response of different species to the warming climate might eventually transform the subalpine Abies fabric forest into Betula utilis forest similar to that which is now widely distributed in the eastern Tibetan Plateau mountainous areas with the relatively lower elevation. Subalpine forests could move to higher and colder areas, which are currently tundra.",0
"Diel temperature oscillations are a nearly ubiquitous phenomenon, with amplitudes predicted to change along with mean temperatures under global-warming scenarios. Impact assessments of global warming have largely disregarded diel temperature oscillations, even though key processes in ecosystems, such as decomposition, may be affected. We tested the effect of a 5 degrees C temperature increase with and without diel oscillations on litter decomposition by fungal communities in stream microcosms. Five temperature regimes with identical thermal sums (degree days) were applied: constant 38 and 8 degrees C; diel temperature oscillations of 5 degrees C around each mean; and oscillations of 9 degrees C around 8 degrees C. Temperature oscillations around 8 degrees C (warming scenario), but not 3 degrees C (ambient scenario), accelerated decomposition by 18% (5 degrees C oscillations) and 31% (9 degrees C oscillations), respectively, compared to the constant temperature regime at 8 degrees C. Community structure was not affected by oscillating temperatures, although the rise in mean temperature from 38 to 8 degrees C consistently shifted the relative abundance of species. A simple model using temperature-growth responses of the dominant fungal decomposers accurately described the experimentally observed pattern, indicating that the effect of temperature oscillations on decomposition in our warming scenario was caused by strong curvilinear responses of species to warming at low temperature, particularly of the species becoming most abundant at 8 degrees C (Tetracladium marchalianum). These findings underscore the need to consider species-specific temperature characteristics in concert with changes in communities when assessing consequences of global warming on ecosystem processes.",0
"Range shifts are among the most conspicuous effects of global warming. Marked changes in distribution are recorded both for highly mobile species of insects, which are capable of flight, and wing-dimorphic species with predominantly short-winged individuals. One of these species is the bush-cricket Metrioptera roeselii, which occasionally produces long-winged individuals. However, there is little known about the locomotory behaviour of wing-dimorphic insects. Yet to be able to predict potential range shifts it is necessary to know the dispersal potential of macropters. Therefore, an experiment was conducted in which individually marked M. roeselii were released at four sites. Different movement parameters, such as daily movement, activity radius, dispersal range, net displacement and crowding rate, were calculated. The statistical analyses showed that the movement of long-winged and short-winged individuals did not differ, but the percentage of individuals that were not seen again was twice as high for long-winged bush-crickets. These results suggest that most of the long-winged individuals that were seen again did not fly; i.e., they had the same basic mobility as the short-winged individuals. However, the comparatively low number of long-winged individuals that were seen again suggests that at least some macropters are long-distance dispersers, which is relevant for the dispersal process. The comparison of sexes showed that males were significantly more mobile than females. This sex-specific locomotory behaviour in M. roeselii might depend on a complex series of social interactions and physiological conditions.",0
"In this paper, the physical mechanism of the polar halocline catastrophe (PHC) is reexamined with emphasis on the role played by the surface heat flux. It is argued that, in a coupled ocean-atmosphere system, thermal changes in the atmospheric state in response to changes in heat flux from the ocean weaken the feedback responsible for the PHC. So far, the PHC has been observed in models that use mixed boundary conditions; that is, the freshwater flux is specified, but the surface temperature is relaxed to a specified value. Previous explanations of the PHC have focused on the role of the freshwater flux in establishing a freshwater cap and shutting off the deep convection. However, the establishment of a freshwater cap reduces the depth of the water column that is cooled by surface heat loss. As a consequence, the surface temperature is reduced. Since the difference between this and atmospheric restoring temperature is now less, there is a corresponding reduction in the surface heat loss to the atmosphere, and this acts to further stabilize the water column. We examine the importance of this reduction in surface heat loss by considering two numerical experiments that are identical except that one is run under mixed boundary conditions and the other under a flux boundary condition applied to temperature as well as salinity. In each case, the surface fluxes are diagnosed from an experiment run to equilibrium using restoring boundary conditions on both fields. This also provides the initial state for both experiments. A PHC is easily induced in the mixed boundary condition case but not in the case using flux boundary conditions. By reducing the magnitude of the heat flux but not its sip, a pool of fresh water appears at the surface, but its effect is weaker than that under mixed boundary conditions and, in particular, there is no collapse of the meridional overturning circulation. A pool of fresh water also appears in an experiment in which a small, positive heat flux is added at all latitudes, a situation of relevance to global warming. This leads to an initial cooling in a shallow layer at the surface of the polar oceans, before heating at lower latitudes leads to a collapse of this state. These experiments show that the reduction in the surface heat flux that occurs when the PHC develops under mixed boundary conditions is an essential feature of the PHC. The use of mixed boundary conditions assumes that the atmospheric state is fixed and does not respond to changes in heat flux from the ocean. If the atmosphere were allowed to adjust to changes in this heat flux, then a PHC would be less likely to occur. This has been demonstrated by coupling the ocean model to the zero-heat-capacity atmospheric model used by Schopf. This is justified, following Bretherton, because of the large horizontal scale of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the experiments. The authors were unable to induce a PHC with this model. In reality, the atmospheric boundary condition seen by the ocean lies somewhere between the two extremes of mixed boundary conditions, on the one hand, and Schopf's model on the other. We have investigated this intermediate region by conducting experiments in which SST anomalies are damped on successively shorter time scales. These show that if the damping time is reduced sufficiently, a PHC can again be induced.",0
"Global climate change is affecting Africa, as it is every other continent and region of the world. The absolute poverty of a large proportion of the continent's people renders them highly vulnerable to changes in climate. Mitigation of climate change is a global imperative. However, numerous other changes continue apace, notably population growth, natural resource degradation, and rural-urban migration. Probably 50% or more of the continent's population rely on groundwater. This paper explores the relative impacts of changes in climate, demography and land use/cover on groundwater resources and demands. It concludes that the climate change impacts are likely to be significant, though uncertain in direction and magnitude, while the direct and indirect impacts of demographic change on both water resources and water demand are not only known with far greater certainty, but are also likely to be much larger. The combined effects of urban population growth, rising food demands and energy costs, and consequent demand for fresh water represent real cause for alarm, and these dwarf the likely impacts of climate change on groundwater resources, at least over the first half of the 21st century.",0
"Due to global warming, southern hyperbenthic species were expected, which extend their distribution range northwards. It was also expected that alien species would have invaded the surf zone hyperbenthos. Therefore, the species composition of the hyperbenthos occurring along the Belgian coast was determined, and spatial and temporal patterns in community composition were assessed. The hyperbenthos was sampled with a hand-pushed sledge on 10 sandy beaches during summer 1995, winter 1996, summer 2009 and winter 2010. Neither alien species nor any southern species which recently extended its distribution range northwards were observed during the present study, indicating that alien species and global warming did not yet affect the species composition of the surf zone hyperbenthos along the Belgian coast. The hyperbenthic community was dominated by Mysida, while Amphipoda were the most diverse group. Multivariate analysis revealed that temporal patterns dominated over spatial patterns: winter and summer hyperbenthic communities clearly differed in species composition and different species assemblages were also observed between the first and the recent sampling campaigns. Although for several other groups, a decline in species richness has been observed closer to the mouth of the Westerschelde, no spatial gradient could be recognised for the surf zone hyperbenthos. Instead, it was found that species richness was positively related to beach width. It could be concluded that the species composition and the total abundance of surf zone hyperbenthic communities along sandy beaches of the Belgian coast strongly vary in space, but especially in time.",0
"We compared the Q(10) relationship for root-derived respiration (including respiration due to the root, external mycorrhizal mycelium and rhizosphere microorganisms) with that of mainly external ectomycorrhizal mycelium and that of bulk soil microorganisms without any roots present. This was studied in a microcosm consisting of an ectomycorrhizal Pinus muricata seedling growing in a sandy soil, and where roots were allow to colonize one soil compartment, mycorrhizal mycelium another compartment, and the last compartment consisted of root- and mycorrhiza-free soil. The respiration rate in the bulk soil compartment was 30 times lower than in the root compartment, while that in the mycorrhizal compartment was six times lower. There were no differences in Q(10) (for 5-15degreesC) between the different compartments, indicating that there were no differences in the temperature relationship between root-associated and non-root-associated organisms. Thus, there are no indications that different Q(10) values should be used for different soil organism, bulk soil or rhizosphere-associated microorganisms when modelling the effects of global climate change.",0
"Spring and autumn frost tolerance was measured using material from a range-wide (50-67 N, 38-158 E) provenance trial of four Russian larch species (Larix sukaczewii Dyl., L. sibirica Ledeb., L. gmelinii Rupr. and L. cajanderi Mayr.) growing in northern Sweden. Shoots were collected in early May and late September and frozen at -8, -12, -16 and -20C. Cambial damage was assessed visually after development under ideal conditions for 2 weeks. Differences in frost damage among provenances were highly significant in both spring and autumn. Autumn frost damage was significantly correlated with provenance latitude and longitude and spring frost damage was significantly correlated with provenance longitude but not latitude. Frost damage was not correlated with provenance elevation. North-western provenances showed the least damage and far-eastern provenances the greatest damage in both spring and autumn. A possible explanation for less spring frost damage to north-western provenances is adaptation to maritime conditions in proximity to the Barents Sea, which is often ice free in late winter. This would counteract early loss of frost tolerance and bud flushing if warm spells occurred in late winter. North-eastern Siberian provenances did not show similar adaptation and may exhibit increased spring frost damage if global warming eventually results in the Arctic Ocean north of Siberia becoming ice free in late winter.",0
"The HadGEM2 global climate model is employed to investigate some of the linear contrail effects on climate. Our study parameterizes linear contrails as a thin layer of aerosol. We find that at 100 times the air traffic of year 2000, linear contrails would change the equilibrium global-mean temperature by +0.13 K, corresponding to a climate sensitivity of 0.3 K/(Wm(-2)) and a climate efficacy of 31% (significantly smaller than the only previously published estimate of 59%). Our model suggests that contrails cause a slight warming of the surface and, as noted by most global warming modelling studies, land areas are affected more than the oceans. Also, unlike the contrail coverage and radiative forcing, the contrail temperature change response is not geographically correlated with air traffic patterns. In terms of the contrail impact on precipitation, the main feature is the northern shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone. Finally, our model strongly indicates that the contrail impact on both the diurnal temperature range and regional climate is significantly smaller than some earlier studies suggested.

"This paper deals with the modelling of the global and northern and southern hemispheric anomaly temperature time series using a novel technique based on segmented trends and fractional integration. We use a procedure that permits us to estimate linear time trends and orders of integration at various subsamples, where the periods for the changing trends are endogenously determined by the model. Moreover, we use a non-parametric approach (Bloomfield P, Biometrika, 60:217-226, 1973) for modelling the I(0) deviation term. The results show that the three series (global, northern and southern temperatures) can be well described in terms of fractional integration with the orders of integration around 0.5 in the three cases. The coefficients associated to the time trends are statistically significant in all subsamples for the three series, especially during the final part of the sample, giving then some support to the global warming theories.",0
"Global climate change models predict reduced cloud water in tropical montane forests. To test the effects of reduced cloud water on epiphytes, plants that are tightly coupled to atmospheric inputs, we transplanted epiphytes and their arboreal soil from upper cloud forest trees to trees at slightly lower elevations that are naturally exposed to less cloud water. Control plants moved between trees within the upper site showed no transplantation effects, but experimental plants at lower sites had significantly higher leaf mortality, lower leaf production, and reduced longevity. After the epiphytes died, seedlings of terrestrial gap-colonizing tree species grew from the seed banks within the residual mats of arboreal soil. Greenhouse experiments confirmed that the death of epiphytes can result in radical compositional changes of canopy communities. Thus, tropical montane epiphyte communities constitute both a potentially powerful tool for detecting climate changes and a rich arena to study plant/soil/seed interactions under natural and manipulated conditions. This study also provides experimental evidence that the potential effects of global climate change on canopy and terrestrial communities can be significant for cloud forest biota. Results suggest there will be negative effects on the productivity and longevity of particular epiphytes and a subsequent emergence of an emerging terrestrial component into the canopy community from a previously suppressed seed bank.",0
"This review examines contributions of interdisciplinary (ID) research to understanding interactions between environmental quality, food production and food security. Global patterns of food insecurity and crop production are reviewed in relation to climate, land use and economic changes, as well as potential productivity increases compatible with environmental conservation. Interactions between food production and global processes make food insecurity a complex problem that requires ID analysis at local to global scales. Census and satellite data contribute to understanding of global cropland distribution. Analysis of land-use change exemplifies research between natural and social sciences. Quantitative modelling of global climate change impacts indicates relatively greater potential food insecurity in developing countries. International food security is increasingly interconnected through economic globalization and incentives for increased food production are required. Societies may not be able to expand available cropland without significant environmental risks; enhanced land and water productivity are the major opportunities available to increase food production. This requires renewed efforts in ID work to design and implement sound and efficient agricultural management practices. Models need to be informed by data from field experiments, long-term measurements and watershed monitoring by ground and remote sensing methods. Agricultural intensification may spare natural land but lead to increased pollution and water demand; reconciling conservation and productivity is a critical need. ID work provides many opportunities for synergies including conservation agriculture at the local level, efficient use of inputs, smarter land use taking into account spatial patterns and landscape ecology principles, and improved water management at field, system, watershed and basin levels. Goal-directed ID research is crucial, since producers, practitioners and policy makers should be involved. Geospatial, biotechnological and precision agriculture technologies linked with models can help inform strategies to achieve sustainable food production increases that maintain environmental quality. Implementation also requires ID work to overcome impediments due to human factors and facilitate adoption by farmers.",0
"Climate modelling studies have predicted an increase in fire frequency with global warming as well as suggesting a longer fire season occurring later in the year. We used 160 years of fire scars in Pinus banksiana Lamb. dating from 1831 to 1948 and written fire records from 1927 to 1995 for Prince Albert National Park in the southern boreal forest to look for evidence of changes in the duration and timing of the fire season (defined as the months when large areas burn) that may have accompanied past changes in fire frequency. The Park's time-since-fire distribution had indicated two such changes: one around 1890 and the other around 1945, both in the direction of decreasing fire frequency. Both fire scars and written fire records indicated that the dominance of the spring fire season (April-June) has remained unchanged over the past 160 years. A small number of scars suggested that the fire season may have extended slightly into the summer (July) prior to 1890 when the fire cycle was much shorter and that the fire season may have shifted to a slightly earlier spring start after 1945 when the fire cycle was much longer.",0
"Climate model global warming simulations predict large regional changes in tropical rainfall, including regions of drought. Qualitatively similar changes occur during El Nino interannual variability. Using an intermediate climate model, we have identified a mechanism that creates regional reductions in precipitation at the margins of convection zones during warming. In this ""upped-ante mechanism'', a warm troposphere increases the value of surface boundary layer moisture required for convection to occur. In regions of plentiful moisture supply, moisture simply rises to maintain precipitation, but this increases the moisture gradient relative to neighboring subsidence regions. Reductions in rainfall then result for those margins of convection zones that have strong inflow of air from the subsidence regions and less frequently meet the increased ""ante'' for convection. In simulations analyzed here, this new mechanism is the leading cause of tropical drought in the global warming case and is dominant in certain El Nino drought regions.",0
"Emissions of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO,) from spent mycelia of the mold Penicilium notatum and sludge from the effluent treatment facility (ETPS) of a pharmaceutical industry were estimated twice during a two-week composting before vermicomposting. These wastes are dumped in landfills or sometimes used in agricultural fields and no reports are available on their greenhouse gas producing potentials. The solid wastes contained appreciable organic carbon and nitrogen while very high Fe, Mn and Zn were found in ETPS only. Pure wastes did not support germination of Vigna radiata L. while mixing soil with ETPS and spent mycelia at the ratios of 12:1 and 14:1 led to 80% and 50% germination, respectively. The wastes were mixed with cowdung at the ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 3:1 for composting. Carbon dioxide emissions were always significantly higher than CH4 emissions from all the treatments due to prevalence of aerobic condition during composting. From some treatments, CH4 emissions increased with time, indicating increasing activity of anaerobic bacteria in the waste mixtures. Methane emissions ranged from 26 to 237 mu g m(-2) day(-1) while CO2 emissions were greater than thousand times at 39.8-894.8 mg m(-2) day(-1). The amount of C emitted as CH4-C and CO2-C from ranged from 0.007% to 0.081% of total C composted. Cowdung emitted highest CH4 followed by spent mycelia and ETPS while ETPS emitted more CO2 than spent mycelia but lesser than cowdung. Global warming potential of emitted CH4 was found to be in the range of 10.6-27.7 mg-CO2-equivalent on a 20-year time horizon. The results suggest that pharmaceutical wastes can be an important source of CH4 and CO2 during composting or any other stockpiling under suitable moisture conditions. The waste mixtures were found not suitable for vermicomposting after two weeks composting and earthworms did not survive long in the mixtures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Near surface, atmospheric voltage gradients [E-z] measured at 31 sites of the Kennedy Space Center [KSC], between Aug. 1997 and Dec. 2005, averaged 162.5 +/- 3.5 V/m, positive upward, with a standard deviation of 24 V/m and an apparent trend of + 0.40 +/- 04 %/ yr. That is, no significant positive trend, predicted to be a consequence of global warming, yet rises above the noise. The correlation of E-z with a monthly index of galactic cosmic rays at Haleakala, Hawaii, was - 0.07 +/- 0.18, for periods between 2 and 25 months. That is, no significant short-period effect of solar-magnetically modulated cosmic-ray flux on E-z was observed at KSC, during this epoch.",0
"Annual and seasonal cycles of convectively important atmospheric parameters for North America have been computed using the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) Global Climate Model using a decade of CCSM3 data. Results for the spatial and temporal distributions of environments conducive to severe convective weather qualitatively agree with observational estimates from NCAR/NCEP global reanalyses, although the model underestimates the frequency of occurrence of severe weather environments. This result demonstrates the possibility for future studies aimed at determining possible changes in the distribution of severe weather environments associated with global climate change.

"Climate change is one of the main factors that will affect biodiversity in the future and may even cause species extinctions. We suggest a methodology to derive a general relationship between biodiversity change and global warming. In conjunction with other pressure relationships, our relationship can help to assess the combined effect of different pressures to overall biodiversity change and indicate areas that are most at risk. We use a combination of an integrated environmental model ( IMAGE) and climate envelope models for European plant species for several climate change scenarios to estimate changes in mean stable area of species and species turnover. We show that if global temperature increases, then both species turnover will increase, and mean stable area of species will decrease in all biomes. The most dramatic changes will occur in Northern Europe, where more than 35% of the species composition in 2100 will be new for that region, and in Southern Europe, where up to 25% of the species now present will have disappeared under the climatic circumstances forecasted for 2100. In Mediterranean scrubland and natural grassland/steppe systems, arctic and tundra systems species turnover is high, indicating major changes in species composition in these ecosystems. The mean stable area of species decreases mostly in Mediterranean scrubland, grassland/steppe systems and warm mixed forests.",0
"Ecosystems at high elevations may be especially sensitive to global warming, because productivity is limited to a snow-free growing season, and warming is expected to cause earlier snowmelt. Here we report on vegetation responses to experimental warming in a subalpine meadow in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. We found no evidence that the plant community changed during four years of warming. Species composition in warmed plots did not change more through time than in control plots, nor did warmed plots diverge from adjacent control plots through time. Contrary to an earlier report, we found no evidence that warming facilitated adults or seedlings of sagebrush, a shrub characteristic of lower elevation ecosystems; nor did it facilitate short-lived plant species as a group. Total vegetation cover, as well as cover of graminoids, forbs, and shrubs, did not differ between control and warmed plots, nor did species richness or species' distributions along a small elevational gradient within each plot. Shrub cover tended to increase more, and forb cover to decrease more, in warmed than in control plots during one summer season, but not significantly so. This lack of detectable plant community response contrasts with pronounced responses to warming in some arctic and alpine ecosystems over similar time spans. Warming in these ecosystems is thought to act indirectly via increased mobilization of soil nutrients. One possible reason for the lack of response in our system is that drying of soil limits microbial activity, photosynthesis, and plant growth sooner in the season in warmed plots, canceling out effects of earlier snowmelt. If this is correct, and if summer precipitation patterns are unchanged under global warming, then vegetation in arid high-elevation ecosystems may change only slowly.",0
"order to estimate the past groundwater recharge rates from deep borehole temperature data, observed temperature-depth profiles are compared with the profiles calculated from heat conduction-convection equation under the condition of linear increase in surface temperature due to global warming and urbanization in Tokyo metropolitan area. The results show the increase in groundwater recharge rate from the 1890s to 1940s, and it decreased from the 1940s to 1990s. These estimations agree well with the precipitation record in Tokyo during the last 100 years. Therefore, the deep borehole temperature data can be used for estimating not only surface temperature history but also the past groundwater recharge rate in Tokyo area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

"During the last few decades, Mediterranean epibenthic assemblages have been involved in mass mortality events, in which sea fans were one of the most threatened groups. Explants of the most common Mediterranean gorgonians (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella cavolinii, E. singularis, and E. verrucosa, 40 explants from each species) were transplanted in the field in order to evaluate the response to transplantation, survival and growth rate of the cuttings during an annual cycle, from February 2003 to March 2004. Colonies of each species overcame transplantation stress and during the first three months they showed a mean survival rate of 98% and an average positive growth rate of 7.65%. In the summer season 2003, during the heatwave that affected the Mediterranean basin, the experimental cuttings suffered, showing a mean negative growth rate and a reduction of survival. At the end of the stress event, P. clavata revealed the worst recovery while all Eunicella species showed a good ability to recover. In particular, E. singularis evidenced the highest resilience among the species. The transplant method described here could be employed to try to recover sea fan populations in the precoralligenous and coralligenous communities in possible future projects of restocking, where anthropic activities (anchoring and/or fishing) and global warming are deeply compromising their survival. Moreover, a species-specific capability to recover was identified after the stress event concomitant to the increase of the sea temperature.",0
"This paper reviews both the changing global climates as the Palaeozoic progressed and also our progressive understanding of them over the past two hundred years of increasing geological awareness. There were two glacial intervals, a short (about half a million years) Hirnantian one at the end of the Ordovician and a very much longer one which lasted for much of the Carboniferous and the lower part of the Permian. There were also periods of global warming; for example, the late Ordovician (Middle Ashgill) Boda Event immediately preceded the Hirnantian glaciation. Much has been deduced about Palaeozoic climatic variation for about two hundred years, but it is only since the advent of the understanding of plate tectonics in the 1960 s that a coherent picture is beginning to emerge of palaeoclimates around the globe. Although the terms themselves are somewhat misleading, recognition of alternating `greenhouse' and `icehouse' states provides effective models for global climate analysis, both today and in the Palaeozoic.",0
" Quantitative subtidal surveys of fishes, macro-invertebrates and sessile organisms at 33 sites within the Lord Howe Island Marine Park revealed a rich fauna and. ora, including 164 fishes, 40 mobile invertebrate taxa, 53 coral and other sessile invertebrate taxa, 32 algal taxa, and two seagrasses. The biota in this newly-zoned marine park was overwhelmingly tropical when species lists were tabulated; however, species with distributions centred on temperate coasts of eastern Australia and New Zealand occurred in disproportionately high densities compared with the tropical species. 2. Lord Howe Island reefs were generally in good condition. Virtually no bleached coral was observed (0.2% of the reef surface; 0.8% of total hard coral cover). Living scleractinian coral comprised the predominant group of organisms growing on reef surfaces, with 25.5% cover overall. Other major taxa observed were brown algae (18.8% cover) and red algae (16.9% cover). 3. Three distinctive community types were identified within the marine park-coral reefs, macroalgal beds and an offshore/open coast community. The distribution of these community types was strongly related to wave exposure, as indicated by an extremely high correlation with the first principal coordinates axis for biotic data (R(2) = 50.80). 4. The close (<3 km) proximity of tropical coral and temperate macroalgal community types off Lord Howe Island is highly unusual, with localized patterns of nutrient enrichment suggested as the primary cause. The macroalgal community type is only known from a small area off the south-western coast that is not protected from fishing. This community is considered highly susceptible to threats because of potential impacts of global warming and the possibility of expansion of sea urchin barrens. Coral bleaching and ocean acidification associated with global climate change also threaten the coral reef community, which includes relatively high numbers of endemic and near endemic fish species.

"Soil respiration, R(S), the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux(1-3). However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained(4,5). Ecosystem warming experiments(6,7), modelling analyses(8,9) and fundamental biokinetics(10) all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.",0
"A study of upper Paleocene-lower Eocene (P-E) sediments deposited on the Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean reveals relatively high abundances of terrestrial biomarkers. These include dehydroabietane and simonellite derived from conifers (gymnosperms) and a tetra-aromatic triterpenoid derived from angiosperms. The relative percentage of the angiosperm biomarker of the summed angiosperm +conifer biomarkers was increased at the end of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), different when observed with pollen counts which showed a relative decrease in angiosperm pollen. Stable carbon isotopic analysis of these biomarkers shows that the negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) during the PETM amounts to 3 parts per thousand for both conifer biomarkers, dehydroabietane and simonellite, comparable to the magnitude of the CIE inferred from marine carbonates, but significantly lower than the 4.5 parts per thousand of the terrestrial C(29) n-alkane [M. Pagani, N. Pedentchouk, M. Huber, A. Sluijs, S. Schouten, H. Brinkhuis, J.S. Sinninghe Damste, G.R. Dickens, and the IODP Expedition 302 Expedition Scientists (2006), Arctic's hydrology during global warming at the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. Nature, 442, 671-675.], which is a compound sourced by both conifers and angiosperms. Conspicuously, the angiosperm-sourced aromatic triterpane shows a much larger CIE of 6 parts per thousand and suggests that angiosperms increased in their carbon isotopic fractionation during the PETM. Our results thus indicate that the 4.5 parts per thousand C(29) n-alkane CIE reported previously represents the average CIE of conifers and angiosperms at this site and suggest that the large and variable CIE observed in terrestrial records may be partly explained by the variable contributions of conifers and angiosperms. The differential response in isotopic fractionation of angiosperms and conifers points to different physiological responses of these vegetation types to the rise in temperature, humidity, and greenhouse gases during the PETM.

"Earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) acclimated at 2 degrees C above their habitat temperature (10-12 degrees C) showed about 5% increase in basal rate of oxygen consumption, which increased to about 38% in 14-16 degrees C- and 40% in 16-18 degrees C-, but decreased by 84% in 20-22 degrees C-acclimated worms. Temperature also increased the blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, which decreased slightly in 20-22 degrees C-acclimated worms. The worms acclimated at 20-22 degrees C showed their blood to be hypovolemic than that of 10-12 degrees C worms indicating dehydration. Pre-exposure of 10-14 degrees C-acclimated worms to sublethal concentrations of zinc, copper, and lead did not significantly affect the rate of respiration. However, at higher temperatures all these metals inhibited oxygen consumption; zinc, lead, and cadmium by similar to 11% and copper by similar to 18% of that at 14-16 degrees C. At 20-22 degrees C, the respiration was further inhibited, 36% by copper, 18% by cadmium, and similar to 10% by lead and zinc. Copper, lead, and zinc decreased the temperature-enhanced increase in blood Hb concentration at all temperatures. In 20-22 degrees C-acclimated worms heavy metal exposure slightly lowered the oxygen affinity of Hb as well as caused shifts in carbon monoxide difference spectra. The acute toxicity of these metals was not affected by a 2 degrees C rise in acclimation temperature but increased by 17% (lead), 33% (copper), and 5% (zinc) in 14-16 degrees C- and by 40% (lead), 149% (copper), and 132% (zinc) in 20-22 degrees C-acclimated worms. The increase in toxicity of metals caused by high temperatures may be due to limiting the scope of aerobic metabolism (oxygen extraction, transport, and utilization) via quantitative and qualitative effects on Hb. This terrestrial species appears to be tolerant of slight increases in habitat temperature, Such as that expected with current global climate change. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
"Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) 11 and 12 transports across the transoceanic World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) A25 section in the subpolar North Atlantic are derived from an inverse model using hydrographic and ADCP data (Lherminier et al., 2007). CFC and anthropogenic carbon (C(ANT)) advective transports contrary to expected are uncoupled: C(ANT) is transported northeastwards (82 +/- 39 kmol s(-1)) mainly within the overturning circulation, while CFC-11 and CFC-12 are transported southwestwards (-24 +/- 4 and -11 +/- 2 mol s(-1), respectively) as part of the large-scale horizontal circulation. The main reason for this uncoupled behaviour is the complex CFC vs. C(ANT) relation in the ocean, which stems from the contrasting temperature relation for both tracers: more C(ANT) dissolves in warmer waters with a low Revel le factor, while CFC's solubility is higher in cold waters. These results point to C(ANT) and CFC having different routes of uptake, accumulation and transport within the ocean, and hence: C(ANT) transport would be more sensitive to changes in the overturning circulation strength, while CFC to changes in the East Greenland Current and Labrador Sea Water formation in the Irminger Sea. Additionally, C(ANT) and CFCs would have different sensitivities to circulation and climate changes derived from global warming as the slowdown of the overturning circulation, increase stratification due to warming and changes in wind stress.

"The global warming trend of the latest Oligocene was interrupted by several cooling events associated with Antarctic glaciations. These cooling events affected surface water productivity and plankton assemblages. Well-preserved radiolarians were obtained from upper Oligocene to lower Miocene sediments at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 199 Sites 1218 and 1219 in the equatorial Pacific, and 110 radiolarian species were identified. Four episodes of significant radiolarian faunal changes were identified: middle late Oligocene (27.5 to 27.3 Ma), latest Oligocene (24.4 Ma), earliest Miocene (23.3 Ma), and middle early Miocene (26 Ma). These four episodes approximately coincide with increases and decreases of biogenic silica accumulation rates and increases in 6180 values coded as ""Oi"" and ""Mi"" events. These data indicate that Antarctic glaciations were associated with change of siliceous sedimentation patterns and faunal changes in the equatorial Pacific. Radiolarian fauna was divided into three assemblages based on variations in radiolarian productivity, species richness and the composition of dominant species: a late Oligocene assemblage (27.6 to 24.4 Ma), a transitional assemblage (24.4 to 23.3 Ma) and an early Miocene assemblage (23.3 to 22 Ma). The late Oligocene assemblage is characterized by relatively high productivity, low species richness and four dominant species of Tholospyris anthophora, Stichocorys subligata, Lophocyrtis nomas and Lithelius spp. The transitional assemblage represents relatively low values of productivity and species richness, and consists of three dominant species of T anthophora, S. subligata and L. nomas. The characteristics of the early Miocene assemblage are relatively low productivity, but high species richness. The two dominant species present in this assemblage are T anthophora and Cyrtocapsella tetrapera. The most significant faunal turnover of radiolarians is marked at the boundary between the transitional/early Miocene assemblages. We also reviewed changes in other microfossil assemblages in the low latitudes during the late Oligocene through early Miocene. The microfossil assemblages of major groups show sequential changes near the Oligocene/Miocene (O/M) boundary (23.8 Ma). Many extinction events and some first occurences of calcareous nannofossils and many occurrences of radiolarians are found from about 24.8 to 23.3 Ma, and first occurrences of planktic foraminifers and diatoms followed from 23.2 through 22 Ma. Hence, the ON boundary is identified as a significant level for microfossil evolutions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.",0

"Coral reefs are dominated by symbioses between marine invertebrates (e.g. corals, clams, sea anemones, sponges) and the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Increases in seawater temperature linked to global warming have lead to the phenomenon known as ""bleaching"", involving the disassociation of these symbioses and mass mortalities of the invertebrate host. Mass bleaching events have been linked to a thermal lesion in the photosynthesis of Symbiodinium, either at photosystem II or in the dark reactions of photosynthesis. Examination of two of the proposed lesion points, the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) and form II Rubisco, indicate that, over the temperature range examined, the CCM is not disrupted in Symbiodinium isolated from giant clams, however it was not possible to determine if Rubisco is the point of thermal lesion resulting in bleaching. Maximum photosynthetic rates were measured between 28 and 31degreesC and declined as temperature was increased. Despite a low correlation between Rubisco activity, oxygen evolution and temperature, Rubisco activity declined with increasing temperature.",0
" Climatic data, ice core records, the tree ring index, and recorded glacier variations have been used to reconstruct a history of climatic and glacial changes in the monsoonal temperate glacier region of southwestern China during the last 400 years. The region's temperature has increased in a fluctuating manner during the twentieth century after two cold stages of the Little Ice Age ( seventeenth to nineteenth centuries), with a corresponding retreat of most of the glaciers, against a background of global warming. Retreat rates accelerated after the 1980s. The few advancing glaciers that did exist have started to retreat in recent years. The amount, trend, and amplitude of variation of precipitation have differed in different parts of the region. The Dasuopu ice core, from the western part of the region, shows a decreasing trend in precipitation, the converse of the trend in temperature. In the eastern part of the region, however, a rising trend of rainfall has accompanied increasing temperatures as a result of the variable atmospheric circulations from different sources. The southwest monsoon, the principal controlling factor in the Chinese monsoonal temperate glacier region, can be classified into the Indian monsoon and the Bengal monsoon. The former passes across the Indian Peninsula from the Arabian Sea and transports vapor for precipitation in the western part of the monsoonal temperate glacier region. The Bengal monsoon, originating in the Bay of Bengal, is the major source of precipitation in the eastern part of the region. The eastern part is also influenced by the southeast monsoon arriving from the western Pacific, and the western part is affected in winter by the southern branch of the westerly circulation. This complex atmospheric situation results in differing patterns of precipitation in the western and eastern zones. Although it is clear that both temperature and precipitation affect the glaciers, further work is needed to confirm which of these is the major factor influencing present glacier change.",0
"Carbon monoxide plays a primary role in governing OH abundances in the troposphere. It is likely that through this chemical interaction, CO plays an important role in climate forcing by affecting CH4 concentrations. We use a photochemical box model to estimate the indirect global warming potential (GWP) of tropospheric carbon monoxide resulting from its effect on methane abundances. We also consider indirect GWPs of CO due to carbon dioxide production and possible CO GWP ranges due to ozone production to estimate a total CO indirect GWP range over various time horizons. We estimate that for current emission levels, the short-term (<15 years) cumulative radiative forcing due to the direct anthropogenic emission of CO may be larger than the cumulative forcing due to anthropogenically emitted N2O.",0
"Detailed Late-glacial and Holocene palaeoenvironmental records from the northern Apennines with a robust chronology are still rare, though the region has been regarded as a main area of potential refugia of important trees such as Picea abies and Abies alba. We present a new high-resolution pollen and stomata record from Lago del Greppo (1,442 m a.s.l., Pistoia, northern Apennines) that has been dated relying on 12 terrestrial plant macrofossils. Late-glacial woodlands became established before 13000 cal b.p. and were dominated by Pinus and Betula, although more thermophilous taxa such as Quercus, Tilia and Ulmus were already present in the Greppo area, probably at lower altitudes. Abies and Picea expanded locally at the onset of the Holocene at ca. 11500 cal b.p. Fagus sylvatica was the last important tree to expand at ca. 6500 cal b.p., following the decline of Abies. Human impact was generally low throughout the Holocene, and the local woods remained rather closed until the most recent time, ca. a.d. 1700-1800. The vegetational history of Lago del Greppo appears consistent with that of previous investigations in the study region. Late-glacial and Holocene vegetation dynamics in the northern Apennines are very similar to those in the Insubrian southern Alps bordering Switzerland and Italy, across the Po Plain. Similarities between the two areas include the Late-glacial presence of Abies alba, its strong dominance during the Holocene across different vegetation belts from the lowlands to high elevations, as well as its final fire and human-triggered reduction during the mid Holocene. Our new data suggest that isolated and minor Picea abies populations survived the Late-glacial in the foothills of the northern Apennines and that at the onset of the Holocene they moved upwards, reaching the site of Lago del Greppo. Today stands of Picea abies occur only in two small areas in the highest part of the northern Apennines, and they have become extinct elsewhere. Given the forecast global warming, these relict Picea abies stands of the northern Apennines, which have a history of at least 13,000 years, appear severely endangered.",0
"Vertical temperature profiles were recorded from June 1999 to October 2002 (at least once a month) at two Mediterranean sites, in the eastern basin (Batroun, Lebanon; 0-100 m) and in the northwestern basin (Marseilles, France; 0-55 m). At the two sites, the thermal seasonal evolution and the thermocline time dynamics are quite identical. But in the Lebanese waters, at comparable water depths, temperatures are currently 4 to 5 degreesC higher than in the French waters, the thermocline is longer (more than 6 months), permanent and deeper (40-50 m) than in Marseilles (20-30 m). The latter frequently disappears in summer due to northwest winds inducing cold waters. This is principally due to differences in prevailing wind regimes at each site. Such evaluation, coupled with long-term observations of temporal evolution of coastal water at the regional level of the Mediterranean basins, will shed light on temperature regime fluctuations and their consequences in the context of global warming of the Mediterranean.

"Restoration of wetland hydrology can produce ecological benefits but may have unintended consequences. We examined effects of altered water level on release of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and greenhouse gases (GHG) in soil cores from a marsh being evaluated for restoration. We also measured field concentrations of DRP and other constituents in wetland porewater. Intact cores from a sampling location with higher Fe and lower calcium carbonate (CaCO3) contents released more DRP than another location, and displayed higher DRP under completely saturated compared to partly drained conditions. Porewater samples collected from the high-Fe location also contained higher DRP levels. Chemical data suggest that redox-driven reactions largely controlled DRP levels at the high-Fe site, while CaCO3 adsorption was more important at the low-Fe site. Over the long term, water table elevation may attenuate P draining from the wetland due to decreased mineralization. However, such measures may increase P release in the short term. Raising the water level in soil cores resulted in decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, increased methane (CH4) emissions, and an overall increase in total global warming potential (GWP). The proportion of total GWP contributed by N2O decreased from 14% to <= 1% as water level was raised, while the proportion contributed by CH, increased from 10 to 20% to 60 to 80%. Restoration of hydrology in the Rice Lake wetland has the potential to affect both local water quality and global air quality These combined effects complicate the cost-to-benefit analysis of such wetland restoration efforts.",0
"Aim The aim of this study was to test a variant of the evolutionary time hypothesis for the bird latitudinal diversity gradient derived from the effects of niche conservatism in the face of global climate change over evolutionary time. Location The Western Hemisphere. Methods We used digitized range maps of breeding birds to estimate the species richness at two grain sizes, 756 and 12,100 km(2). We then used molecular phylogenies resolved to family to quantify the root distance (RD) of each species as a measure of its level of evolutionary development. Birds were classified as 'basal' or 'derived' based on the RD of their family, and richness patterns were contrasted for the most basal and most derived 30% of species. We also generated temperature estimates for the Palaeogene across the Western Hemisphere to examine how spatial covariation between past and present climates might make it difficult to distinguish between ecological and evolutionary hypotheses for the current richness gradient. Results The warm, wet tropics support many species from basal bird clades, whereas the northern temperate zone and cool or dry tropics are dominated by species from more recent, evolutionarily derived clades. Furthermore, crucial to evaluating how niche conservatism among birds may drive the hemispherical richness gradient, the spatial structure of the richness gradient for basal groups is statistically indistinguishable from the overall gradient, whereas the richness gradient for derived groups is much shallower than the overall gradient. Finally, modern temperatures and the pattern of climate cooling since the Eocene are indistinguishable as predictors of bird species richness. Main conclusions Differences in the richness gradients of basal vs. derived clades suggest that the hemispherical gradient has been strongly influenced by the differential extirpation of species in older, warm-adapted clades from parts of the world that have become cooler in the present. We propose that niche conservatism and global-scale climate change over evolutionary time provide a parsimonious explanation for the contemporary bird latitudinal diversity gradient in the New World, although dispersal limitation of some highly derived clades probably plays a secondary role.",0
"A process-based ecosystem productivity model BEPS (Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator) was updated to simulate half-hourly exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystem at a temperate broad-leaved Korean pine forest in the Changbai Mountains, China. The BEPSh model is able to capture the diurnal and seasonal variability in carbon dioxide, water vapor and heat fluxes at this site in the growing season of 2003. The model validation showed that the simulated net ecosystem productivity (NEP), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H-s) are in good agreement with eddy covariance measurements with an R-2 value of 0.68, 0.86 and 0.72 for NEP, LE and Hs, respectively. The simulated annual NEP of this forest in 2003 was 300.5 gC/m(2), and was very close to the observed value. Driving this model with different climate scenarios, we found that the NEP in the Changbai Mountains temperate broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest ecosystem was sensitive to climate variability, and the current carbon sink will be weakened under the condition of global warming. Furthermore, as a process-based model, BEPSh was also sensitive to physiological parameters of plant, such as maximum Rubisco activity (V-cmax) and the maximum stomatal conductance (g(max)) and needs to be carefully calibrated for other applications.",0
"Forest health monitoring schemes were set Lip across Europe in the 1980s in response to concerns about air pollution-related forest dieback (Waldsterben) and have continued since then. Recent threats to forest health are climatic extremes likely due to global climate change and increased ground ozone levels and nitrogen deposition. We model yearly data on tree crown defoliation, an indicator of tree health, from a monitoring survey carried Out in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany since 1983. On a changing irregular grid, defoliation and other sue-specific variables are recorded, In Baden-Wurttemberg, the temporal trend of defoliation differs among areas because of site characteristics and pollution levels, making it necessary to allow for space-time interaction in the model. For this purpose, we propose using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) incorporating scale-invariant tensor product smooths of the space-time dimensions. The space-time smoother allows separate smoothing parameters and penalties for the space and time dimensions and thus avoids the need to make arbitrary or ad hoc choices about the relative scaling of space and time. The approach of using a space-time smoother has intuitive appeal, making it easy to explain and interpret when communicating the results to nonstaticians, such as environmental policy makers. The model incorporates a nonlinear effect for mean tree age. the most important predictor. allowing the separation of trends in time. which may be pollution-related, from trends that relate purely to the aging of the survey population. In addition to a temporal trend due to site characteristics and other conditions modeled with the space-time Smooth, We account for random temporal correlation at site level by an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. Model selection is carried Out using the Bayes information criterion (BIC). and the adequacy of the assumed spatial and temporal error Structure is investigated with the empirical semivariogram and the empirical autocorrelation function.",0
"Tropospheric accumulation rates of the three most abundant hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) were up to two times faster during 2007 than measured in 2003-2004. Tropospheric chlorine from HCFCs increased at 10 pptCl/yr during 2006-2007, up from 6 pptCl/yr in 2003-2004, and offset declines in chlorine from other anthropogenic ozone-depleting substances in 2007 by approximately one-third. Derived global emissions for HCFCs increased by up to 60% since 2004, and, for HCFC-142b, emissions during 2007 were two times larger than projected recently. Measured tropospheric distributions suggest a shift in HCFC emissions to lower latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. These changes coincide with exponential increases in developing country production and consumption and decreases in other countries. When weighted by direct, 100-yr global warming potentials, HCFC emissions in 2007 amounted to 0.78 GtCO(2)-equivalents, or 30% larger than the average during 2000-2004, and were approximately 2.6% of fossilfuel and cement related CO(2) emissions.

"The Mumbai (Bombay) tide gauge data, the only century-long record in the Indian Ocean, show that interdecadal changes in sea level mimic those in rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. We propose that the link between rainfall and sea level arises from changes in salinity in coastal waters. Rivers fed by southwest monsoon (June-September) rainfall bring a large fraction of the runoff to the Bay of Bengal, from where it is transported to the west coast of India by an equatorward East India Coastal Current, which is triggered partly by the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon. The West India Coastal Current carries the low-salinity water from the bay as well as the runoff from local rivers northward. The advection of the riverine inflow to Mumbai occurs within a season. but the slow mixing in the ocean forces changes in the cross-shore density gradient on longer timescales. This density gradient forces a two-layer geostrophic circulation, with a surface current, which flows with the lighter water on its right, and an undercurrent. Lower (higher) salinity at the coast implies higher (lower) coastal sea level and a rise (fall) of the pycnocline at the coast. Thus the interdecadal variability of sea level along the Indian coast can be Linked directly to the variability of the monsoon, the major aspect of the climate of the region, but by a mechanism that is different from those generally proposed to link sea level to climate change; these hypotheses usually invoke a change in volume because of global warming.",0
"A bioclimate model predicting the presence or absence of aspen, Populus tremuloides, in western USA from climate variables was developed by using the Random Forests classification tree on Forest Inventory data from about 118,000 permanent sample plots. A reasonably parsimonious model used eight predictors to describe aspen's climate profile. Classification errors averaged 4.5%, most of which were errors of commission. The model was driven primarily by three variables: an annual dryness index, the ratio of summer to annual precipitation, and an interaction of growing season precipitation with the summer-winter temperature differential. Projecting the contemporary climate profile into the future climate provided by three General Circulation Models and two scenarios (SRES A2 and either B1 or B2) suggested that the area occupied by the profile should diminish rapidly over the course of the century, 6-41% by the decade surrounding 2030, 40-75% for that surrounding 2060, and 46-94% for 2090. The relevance of the climate profile to understanding climate-based responses is illustrated by relating trends in climate to the recent incidence of sudden aspen dieback that has plagued portions of the aspen distribution. Of the eight variables in the profile, four reached extreme values during 2000-2003, the period immediately preceding the appearance of damage in aerial surveys.

"Context The suitability of thinning to prevent forest growth decline as a result of global warming has not been tested extensively in Macaronesian Canary pine (Pinus canariensis Sweet ex Spreng.). Aims This study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) are tree growth patterns modified by the aspect and thinning intensity? (2) Is sensitivity to climate modulated by thinning? (3) Do trees of different crown classes respond differentially to thinning intensity and climate? Methods We used tree-ring series from dominant, codominant, and overtopped trees to study the effects of thinning intensity on basal area increments (BAI) and climate sensitivity on windward (wet) and leeward (dry) slopes on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Three replicated blocks of control, light thinning, and heavy thinning stands were set on each slope in 1988, and cores were extracted in 2007. Results Heavy thinning induced growth release and increased BAI, mainly on dominant and codominant trees, whereas light thinning effects were negligible; their impacts were more intense on the windward side. Temperature sensitivity was hardly affected by thinning on leeward, where climate control was stronger. On windward, thinning enhanced the influence of summer temperatures. Upper crown classes were more sensitive overall, but overtopped trees responded better in summer. Thinning intensity and aspect greatly influence growth on Canary pine afforestations, but individual responses are highly dependent on crown classes. In addition, thinning may be less effective to modify growth conditions on leeward slopes, at least if not intense.",0
"Three species of dwarf, prostrate willow (Salix arctica, S. rotundifolia and S. herbacea) were subjected to experimental summer warming in high arctic Canada, arctic Alaska, and subarctic Sweden, respectively, as part of the International Tundra Experiment. Phenological and growth responses of these species were compared for the second season of the experiment. Stigmas became receptive and pollen dispersal occurred significantly earlier for S. rotundifolia and S. herbacea in the ITEX open-top chambers, but not for S. arctica. Warming had no effect on the timing of seed dispersal, leaf yellowing, or leaf senescence. The length and dry weight of the largest leaves were greater for warmed plants, and was significant for S. rotundifolia. The number of catkins/plot did not differ among species or treatments, but the fruit:newer ratio was reduced in the experimental plots.",0
"The high degree of habitat heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation in arctic ecosystems may support a high genotypic and ecotypic variability. This may buffer the survival of plant species threatened by global climate change, which affects the Arctic more strongly than other ecosystems. Here, we assessed if two morphotypes of Polygonum viviparum (characterised by different colours of their bulbils) differ in their abundance along a snowmelt gradient, if their biomass allocation patterns are influenced differentially by environmental variables, and if the temperature dependency of bulbil germination differs between morphotypes. We found slight differences in the effect of timing of snowmelt on abundance of the morphotypes, which seem to have little ecological relevance. Total biomass and biomass allocation were similar between morphotypes and were negatively correlated with soil-water content. Bulbil germination (the onset of growth of the bulbil) was assessed over a temperature range from 2 to 25 C and results indicate an earlier (maximum of 5 days) ""germination"" of one morphotype, but final bulbil germination (> 80%) and bulbil-germination rate were similar for both types. Bulbil germination was weakly temperature dependent, with faster emergence at higher temperatures. Overall, our results could provide no convincing evidence for differences between the two examined morphotypes that could be of ecological relevance with respect to anticipated climate change in the Arctic.",0
"Energy efficiency has become an increasingly important aspect of designing access networks, due to both increased concerns for global warming and increased network costs related to energy consumption. Comparing access, metro, and core, the access constitutes a substantial part of the per subscriber network energy consumption and is regarded as the bottleneck for increased network energy efficiency. One of the main opportunities for reducing network energy consumption lies in efficiency improvements of the customer premises equipment. Access networks in general are designed for low utilization while supporting high peak access rates. The combination of large contribution to overall network power consumption and low utilization implies large potential for CPE power saving modes where functionality is powered off during periods of idleness.",0
"Late frost are dangerous climatic hazards that can be responsible of fruit trees yield losses. Late frost potential hazard is, in particular, increased by the enhancement of low-temperature episodes in spring and to the concomitant early-blooming consequent to higher winter temperatures induced by the earth global warming. This paper reports observations on the micrometeorological features associated to frost occurrence in a representative area of the Po valley in order to characterize the atmospheric physics during frost formation episodes, to understand the frequency and the type of risk and to develop the most suitable protection practices. Energy balance and soil radiation balance are reported together with the main atmospheric features (air turbulence included), and the data-set collected are verified against the similarity equations. The computation of the surface roughness and the friction velocity, fundamental to the definition of the distinctive features of the site, has been also done by applying the similarity theory.

"We developed a methodology for linking together data from forest and grassland inventories and ecological research sites, and provided a comprehensive report about live biomass and net primary productivity (NPP) on the Tibetan Plateau, the ""Third Pole"" of the earth where little information about plant biomass and production had been available outside China. Results were as follows. (1) The total live biomass of the natural vegetation in the Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province was estimated its 2,17 Gg dry mass, of which 72.9% was stored in forests where spruce-fir accounted for 65.1% (2) The total annual NPP of the natural vegetation in these two administrative regions, was estimated as 0.57 Gg dry mass. of which grasslands and forests accounted for 69.5% and 18.1%, respectively. (3) The alpine spruce-fir forests of the Tibetan Plateau had the highest maximum live biomass of the spruce-fir forests globally. with values up to 500-1600 Mg DM/ha (including both aboveground and belowground biomass), (4) The QZNPP model generally predicted NPP well for most of the biomes on the plateau, and simulated the various Chinese vegetation divisions. Model results showed a positive reinforcing effect of monsoon climate in China where the warmest season coincides with the wettest season. (5) The live biomass map for 117 counties of Xizang (Tibet) and Qinghai and the Potential NPP map for the whole plateau both showed the same decreasing trend from Southeast to northwest.",0
"The global climate change mitigation policies and their stress on sustainable development have made electrification of rural mountainous villages, using small hydro, an attractive destination for potential clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. This invariably involves judging the additionality of such projects. The paper suggests a new approach to judge the additionality of such stand-alone small hydropower projects. This has been done by breaking up additionality into two components: external and local. The external additionality is project developer dependent. For determining the local additionality, the paper takes into account the probability of a village getting electrified over a period of time, which is kept equal to the possible crediting period. This is done by defining an electrification factor (EF) whose value depends on the degree of isolation, financial constraints and institutional constraints encountered while electrifying a mountainous village. Using this EF, the additionality of a CDM project can be judged in a much easier and accurate way. The paper is based on the data and inputs gathered during site visits to many isolated villages located in the eastern Indian Himalayas. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Climatic change is not a new phenomenon, nor is it random, as most of the variation can be explained in terms of variations in the sunlight reaching the surface of the Earth. The solar energy reaching the surface is modified by the aerosols in the atmosphere, however, and that means primarily aerosols of volcanic origin. The climatic history of the Earth is divided up into episodes with abrupt beginnings and ends. Rapid changes from one climatic state to another are normal. The fluctuations within,this century do not appear to be unusual in any respect. To the Author's knowledge there is no evidence that past climatic changes, including those of the last decades, are related to changes in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - except perhaps for warmer nights in the North American mid-west. It is not possible to simulate past climates using carbon dioxide content as the main variable, but it is possible to do so using calculated solar radiation as modified by volcanic aerosols. This strongly suggests that forecasts of the climatic future based on carbon dioxide increases are suspect. Computerized models of the climate that can simulate decadal and century-long variations of climate as well as variations on the millennium scale, suggest that the climate will not warm dramatically in the next fifty years, but will, rather soon after that, begin a rather rapid change towards the next glacial climate. Changes in our global array of cultures, sufficient to affect the global climate in a way which we perceive as beneficial, probably are not possible within centuries without massive physical conflict. There are both winners and losers when the climate changes in a non-uniform pattern, as it always does. It is a well-known fact that a global change of 0.5-degrees-C in mean temperature, such as has happened in recent years, might produce some regions of 10-degrees-C change in either direction and some regions with no change at all, and additionally an array of rainfall changes of various magnitudes. Russians would welcome warming of their climate! The problems with attempting to modify the global climate in a particular direction are enormous and would be incredibly costly. This is compounded by our not knowing what the climate would. do without intervention. Only one thing is truly clear, and ii is that the present knowledge of the climatic effect of changing carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is totally inadequate as a basis for initiating any global attempt to change the climate. The indicated action would appear to be to engage in some high-quality climatic research based on sound science before taking global risks greater than those that might arise from the putative 'global warming'.",0
"Arctic terrestrial ecosystems are strongly dominated by temperature, and global warming is expected to have a particularly strong impact in high latitudes. The Arctic will therefore be an important region for early detection of global change. In the present study the effects of environmental manipulations simulating climate change on soil microorganisms and nematode populations were investigated. Study sites were a dwarf shrub dominated tree-line heath (450 m a.s.l.) and a high altitude fellfield (1150 m a.s.l.) at Abisko, Swedish Lapland. Soil temperature was enhanced by using passive greenhouses and the impact on soil organisms with and without NPK fertilizer addition was assessed. The nematode community was strongly affected by warming and nutrient application. Population density was twice as high for all treatments at the fellfield as compared to controls. At the heath temperature enhancement with or without fertilizer application also led to a doubling of the population density, whereas fertilization alone caused an increase of about one third. The environmental manipulations resulted in a greater microbial biomass C and active fungal biomass in the heath soil. Increased density was also recorded for bacterial and fungal feeding nematodes at both sites. The results suggest that nematodes have an important impact on microbial biomass and turnover rates in the two subarctic systems. Elevated soil temperature apparently will lead to increased grazing on microorganisms, contributing to enhanced net N and P mineralization rates and plant nutrient availability. However, biodiversity was generally affected negatively by the environmental manipulations. The effects were more severe at the high altitude fellfield indicating that the influence of elevated temperature will be more pronounced in systems already stressed by extreme climatic conditions.",0
"The main primary energy for electricity in Thailand is natural gas, accounting for 73% of the grid mix. Electricity generation from natural gas combustion is associated with substantial air emissions. The two technologies currently used in Thailand, thermal and combined cycle power plant, have been evaluated for the potential environmental impacts in a ""cradle-to-grid"" study according to the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. This study evaluates the environmental impacts of each process of the natural gas power production over the entire life cycle and compares two different power plant technologies currently used in Thailand, namely, combined cycle and thermal. LCA is used as a tool for the assessment of resource consumption and associated impacts generated from utilization of natural gas in power production. The details follow the methodology outlined in ISO 14040. The scope of this research includes natural gas extraction, natural gas separation, natural gas transmission, and natural gas power production. Most of the inventory data have been collected from Thailand, except for the upstream of fuel oil and fuel transmission, which have been computed from Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation version 7 and Global Emission Model for Integrated Systems version 4.3. The impact categories considered are global warming, acidification, photochemical ozone formation, and nutrient enrichment potential (NEP). The comparison reveals that the combined cycle power plant, which has a higher efficiency, performs better than the thermal power plant for global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (ACP), and photochemical ozone formation potential (POCP), but not for NEP where the thermal power plant is preferable. For the thermal power plant, the most significant environmental impacts are from power production followed by upstream of fuel oil, natural gas extraction, separation, and transportation. For the combined cycle power plant, the most significant environmental impacts are from power production followed by natural gas extraction, separation, and transportation. The significant difference between the two types of power production is mainly from the combustion process and feedstock in power plant. The thermal power plant uses a mix of natural gas (56% by energy content) and fuel oil (44% by energy content); whereas, the combined cycle power plant operates primarily on natural gas. The largest contribution to GWP, ACP, and NEP is from power production for both thermal as well as combined cycle power plants. The POCP for the thermal power plant is also from power production; whereas, for combined cycle power plant, it is mainly from transmission of natural gas. In this research, we have examined the environmental impact of electricity generation technology between thermal and combined cycle natural gas power plants. This is the overview of the whole life cycle of natural gas power plant, which will help in decision making. The results of this study will be useful for future power plants as natural gas is the major feedstock being promoted in Thailand for power production. Also, these results will be used in further research for comparison with other feedstocks and power production technologies.",0
"Many of the first European settlers in Africa sought refuge from the heat and diseases of the plains by moving to the cool and salubrious highlands. Although many of the highlands were originally malaria free, there has been a progressive rise in the incidence of the disease over the last 50 years, largely as a consequence of agroforestry development, and it has been exacerbated by scarce health resources. In these areas of fringe transmission where the malaria pattern is unstable, epidemics may be precipitated by relatively subtle climatic changes. Since there is little immunity against the disease in these communities, outbreaks can be devastating, resulting in a substantial increase in morbidity and death among both children and adults. We present here the results obtained using a mathematical model designed to identify these epidemic-prone regions in the African highlands and the differences expected to occur as a result of projected global climate change. These highlands should be recognized as an area of special concern. We further recommend that a regional modelling approach should be adopted to assess the extent and severity of this problem and help improve disease surveillance and the quality of health care delivered in this unstable ecosystem.",0
"Many attempts to predict the biotic responses to climate change rely on the 'climate envelope' approach(1-3), in which the current distribution of a species is mapped in climate-space and then, if the position of that climate-space changes, the distribution of the species is predicted to shift accordingly(4-6). The flaw in this approach is that distributions of species also reflect the influence of interactions with other species(7-10), so predictions based on climate envelopes may be very misleading if the interactions between species are altered by climate change(11). An additional problem is that current distributions may be the result of sources and sinks(12), in which species appear to thrive in places where they really persist only because individuals disperse into them from elsewhere(13,14). Here we use microcosm experiments on simple but realistic assemblages to show how misleading the climate envelope approach can be. We show that dispersal and interactions, which are important elements of population dynamics(15), must be included in predictions of biotic responses to climate change.",0
"With global warming forecast to continue into the foreseeable future, heat waves are very likely to increase in both frequency and intensity. In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975-2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998-2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.",0
"Lubricants are used in numerous applications in our society, for instance, as hydraulic fluids. When used in forestry, 60-80% of these hydraulic fluids are released into the environment. This is one of the reasons for the growing interest for developing and utilising hydraulic fluids with good environmental performance. Another driving force in the development of hydraulic fluids is to replace fossil products with renewable ones. The aim of this paper is to investigate the environmental impact of two types of hydraulic fluids, one based on mineral oil and one on vegetable oil. The difference in environmental impact of using chemical or biocatalytic production methods is also assessed. This life cycle assessment is from cradle-to-gate, including waste treatment. A complementary, laboratory, biodegradability test was also performed. The functional unit is 1 l of base fluid for hydraulic fluids, and mass allocation is applied. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of the energy used and of the allocation method. The impact categories studied are primary energy consumption, global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), photooxidant creation potential (POCP) and biodegradability. The contribution to GWP and primary energy consumption was higher for the mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid than the vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluids. The contributions to EP and AP were higher for the vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid than the mineral oil-based one. The vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid had better biodegradability than the one based on mineral oil. The impact of production method was minor, thus the biocatalytic method gives no significant advantage over chemical methods concerning energy and environmental performance. For the environmental impact categories GWP, POCP and primary energy consumption, hydraulic fluids based on rapeseed oil make a lower contribution than a mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid. For EP and AP, the contributions of TMP oleate are higher than the contribution of mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid. The difference between the chemically catalysed method and the ezymatically catalysed method is negligible because the major environmental impact is due to the production of the raw materials. The vegetable oil-based hydraulic fluid, TMP oleate, was more biodegradable than the mineral oil-based hydraulic fluid.",0
"This article deals with recently status of global fossil energy sources. Fossil energy sources have been split into three categories: oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are highly efficient and cheap. Currently oil is the fastest primary energy source in the world (39% of world energy consumption). Coal will be a major source of energy for the world for the foreseeable future (24% of world energy consumption). In 2030, coal covers 45% of world energy needs. Natural gas is expected to be the fastest growing component of world energy consumption (23% of world energy consumption). Fossil fuel extraction and conversion to usable energy has several environmental impacts. They could be a major contributor to global warming and greenhouse gases and a cause of acid rain; therefore, expensive air pollution controls are required.",0
"The occurrence of record breaking temperature events (RBTE) became more and more frequent under the background of global warming. What is the probability that the current temperature record will be broken in the next five years? In this study, answers are provided by given a variety of simple statistical models for temperature, and the relationship between the probability of RBTE of China and the global warming is explored by comparative analysis of the probability of RBTE in the last 50 years. The results show that the frequency of RBTE is influenced by global warming and the autocorrelation. This, study quantitatively estimates the relationship between the probability of RBTE and global warming, which can deepen our knowledge about the increasing frequency and amplitude of RBTE under the background of global warming.",0
"Measures of growth and skeletal isotopic ratios in the Caribbean coral Montastraea annularis are fundamental to many studies of paleoceanography, environmental degradation, and global climate change. This taxon is shown to consist of at least three sibling species in shallow waters. The two most commonly studied of these show highly significant differences in growth rate and oxygen isotopic ratios, parameters routinely used to estimate past climatic conditions; unusual coloration in the third may have confused research on coral bleaching. Interpretation or comparison of past and current studies can be jeopardized by ignoring these species boundaries.",0
"Due to its wide European distribution and its drought-susceptibility, beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) received intensive attention recently in the light of global warming. Contrary to central European beech ecosystems, little is known about the ecophysiology of beech at its south-eastern European distribution limit. Here we tested whether climatic fluctuations during a three-year period affected the ecophysiology of a beech site in Greece. Attention was paid at comparing our findings to the intense effects The 2003 extreme drought had on beech forests in central Europe. We assessed the interannual and seasonal variation of certain physiological parameters in a beech stand of north-western Greece during three consecutive growing seasons of the period 2003-2005. Leaf water potential and effective quantum yield of PSII were measured as well-known indicators of plant's responses to environmental stresses. Furthermore, plant carbon isotopic composition (delta(13)C) of tissues and extracts with different turnover times was determined, since it can reveal short- or long-term environmental effects on the water and carbon balance of the plant. Moreover, a number of micrometeorological parameters were measured and their effect on ecophysiological responses was tested. Precipitation of 2003 at the study site was comparable to that in central Europe, but it did not differ from the local range of precipitation in NW-Greece. Still, 2003 was more xeric, compared to 2004 and 2005. Despite this, leaf water potential, effective quantum yield and delta(18)O showed no significant variation between years and their values were not indicative of plants suffering from drought stress. Foliar delta(13)C, on the other hand, appeared to be more sensitive to the climatic differences between the years and it was higher during the more xeric 2003 compared to later on. Regression analysis revealed that its response was largely controlled by current soil water content and vapour pressure deficit of the preceding month. Regarding delta(13)C of phloem from both twigs and trunk, their patterns were influenced only by short-term changes in air vapour pressure deficit. Within the climatic range recorded in this study, which is typical for beech ecosystems in Greece, no substantial drought-driven limitations were observed on beech ecophysiology. Our observations contradict those from central European beech sites, rarely subjected to drought, where similarly low water availability had a great impact on the ecophysiology of beech.

"Mediterranean Sea ecosystems are experiencing a phase of major modifications owing to the fast increase in several disturbances such as pollution, eutrophication, habitat destruction, over-fishing, income of alien species, and climate change. One of the main problems in recent years is that global warming seems to intensify the effects of all the above-mentioned disturbances, dramatically reducing the biodiversity of the basin. The ever more frequent mass mortalities that are affecting shallow coastal environments are rapidly reducing the biomass of several filter feeders and both sponges and gorgonians are the most endangered taxa. In this paper we review the most recent episodes of mass mortality, mainly involving sea fans, and discuss the possible effects that the loss of these organisms can have on benthic assemblage structure. The data presented here are referred mainly to the study case of the MPA of Portofino (Ligurian Sea, Italy).",0
"When the Soil Science Society of America was created, 75 yr ago, the USA was suffering from major dust storms, causing the loss of enormous amounts of topsoil as well as human lives. These catastrophic events reminded public officials that soils are essential to society's well-being. The Soil Conservation Service was founded and farmers were encouraged to implement erosion mitigation practices. Still, many questions about soil processes remained poorly understood and controversial. In this article, we argue that the current status of soils worldwide parallels that in the USA at the beginning of the 20th century. Dust bowls and large-scale soil degradation occur over vast regions in a number of countries. Perhaps more so even than in the past, soils currently have the potential to affect populations critically in several other ways as well, from their effect on global climate change, to the toxicity of brownfield soils in urban settings. Even though our collective understanding of soil processes has experienced significant advances since 1936, many basic questions still remain unanswered, for example whether or not a switch to no-till agriculture promotes C sequestration in soils, or how to account for microscale heterogeneity in the modeling of soil organic matter transformation. Given the enormity of the challenges raised by our (ab) uses of soils, one may consider that if we do not address them rapidly, and in the process heed the example of U. S. public officials in the 1930s who took swift action, humanity may not get a chance to explore other frontiers of science in the future. From this perspective, insistence on the fact that soils are critical to life on earth, and indeed to the survival of humans, may again stimulate interest in soils among the public, generate support for soil research, and attract new generations of students to study soils.",0
"It is critical to understand how the public prioritizes multiple forestry values when establishing objectives for sustainable forest management. While this is a complex and difficult task, a necessary step is to elicit a broad range of public opinions in forest planning to ensure that decisions serve the needs of various forest stakeholders and society at large. This study seeks to understand how six forest dependent communities in British Columbia prioritize a number of attributes associated with sustainable forest management by using a simple survey-based measurement tool, the Thurstone scale. The results suggest that ecological attributes are a higher priority for survey respondents followed by quality of life, global warming, and economic considerations. This paper explores some of the ramifications of the priorities for sustainable forest management measured in these six communities as well as implications for using the Thurstone scale in processes like Public Advisory Groups.",0
"in recent years, the threat of global climate change, high fuel import dependence, and rapidly rising electricity demand levels have intensified the quest for more sustainable energy systems. This in turn has increased the need for policy makers to promote electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Guaranteed prices coupled with a buy-back obligation for electricity fed into the grid is a popular renewables promotion instrument, especially in Europe. More recently, driven mainly by electricity market liberalisation efforts, quota targets for the share of renewables in combination with tradable 'green' certificates (TGC) have received considerable attention. TGC offer a greater theoretical potential for economic efficiency gains, due to price competition and the greater flexibility assigned to the obliged parties. While guaranteed prices and TGC schemes support the operation of renewable energy technology systems, bidding schemes for renewable energy generation capacity are used to raise economic efficiency on the plant construction side. All of these policy instruments suffer from the shortcoming that they do not explicitly account for the often widely varying environmental, social and economic impacts of the technologies concerned. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the design of renewable energy policy instruments that is based on integrated assessment. In particular, we argue that using participatory multicriteria evaluation as part of the design of renewable energy promotion policies would make it possible: (1) to differentiate the level of promotion in a systematic and transparent manner according to their socio-ecological economic impact, and (2) to explicitly account for the preferences of stakeholders. A further problem of existing TGC and bidding schemes is that diversity of supply could be severely diminished, if few low-cost technologies were allowed to dominate the renewable energy market. To ensure a certain diversity of technologies, our scheme suggests the use of different technology bands for technologies that are relatively homogeneous with respect to their maturity.

"There is growing recognition that microalgae are among the most productive biological systems for generating biomass and capturing carbon. Further efficiencies are gained by harvesting 100% of the biomass, much more than is possible in terrestrial biomass production systems. Microalgae's ability to transport bicarbonate into cells makes them well suited to capture carbon. Carbon dioxide or'bicarbonate-capturing efficiencies as high as 90% have been reported in open ponds. The scale of microalgal production facilities necessary to capture carbon-dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from stationary point sources such as power stations and cement kilns is also manageable; thus, microalgae can potentially be exploited for CO(2) capture and sequestration. In this article, I discuss possible strategies using microalgae to sequester CO(2) with reduced environmental consequences.",0
This article is a highlight of the paper by Li et al. in this issue of Photochemistry and Photobiology as well as a short summary of the research on the effects of solar UV-B radiation on primary production in the oceans. Laboratory experiments under controlled conditions using artificial light sources indicate species-specific damage of many phytoplankton groups. Mesocosm studies in enclosures of limited volume allow analyzing UV effects in multigeneration monitoring of natural assemblages. Field studies to determine the effects of short-wavelength solar radiation require sensitive instrumentation and measurements over extended areas of the open ocean to yield significant results. Results from a cruise described in the paper by Li et al. indicate clear effects of UV-B and UV-A on the photosynthetic carbon fixation of phytoplankton communities with spatial differences between coastal and open-ocean waters. Increasing temperatures and acidification in the ocean due to global climate change may exacerbate the detrimental effects of solar UV-B radiation.,0
"New computer-based sensor technology and geographic methods have led to emerging interest in use of satellite environmental assessment tools for design of disease control programs, especially for those that are vector borne. The long-range goal of work reported here by John Malone and colleagues on behalf of this Egyptian Ministry of Health-USAID Schistosomiasis Research Project team (Box 1) is to utilize data from sensor systems on board earth-observing satellites to develop more-sensitive disease-prediction and -control models. If successful, methods developed may provide a potentially vital capability for use by disease control program managers, particularly in less-developed countries, where mapping resources ave not well advanced. Longer term, broader basic questions on the interaction of environment and disease in anticipation of predicted global climate change may be addressed. These studies focused on the lower Nile river basin of Egypt The specific objective wits to link data on environmental requirements for propagation and transmission of schistosomiasis with parameters measurable from space.",0
"Climate, the statistical description of weather including the probabilities for anomalies, changes continuously, since both the interaction among the climate system components (atmosphere, ocean, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere) and the irradiance of the sun vary on all timescales up to billions of years. On timescales which are of most interest for mankind, i.e. up to centuries, major factors causing climate variability are: changing composition of the atmosphere; spectral solar irradiance variations; systematic changes of ocean-atmosphere-land interaction, if resulting in major changes of ocean circulation; volcanic eruptions injecting mass into the low latitude stratosphere (>20 km height); and land cover change modifying the surface energy budget. Two of these influencing factors are now largely anthropogenic, namely changing atmospheric conditions and land cover change. Thus, the climate discussion has become to a large extent one about anthropogenic influence. At different periods, different influencing factors have been more important or dominant. Since the complex interactions are only partly understood, it is difficult to attribute observed climate parameter changes or trends to particular causes. In this brief status report on global climate change, present knowledge is reviewed, mainly based on the second full assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",0
"Aim Our aims were to quantify climatic and soil controls on net primary productivity (NPP) and leaf area index (LAI) along subtropical to alpine gradients where the vegetation remains relatively undisturbed, and investigate whether NPP and LAI converge towards threshold-like logistic patterns associated with climatic and soil variables that would help us to verify and parameterize process models for predicting future ecosystem behaviour under global environmental change. Location Field data were collected from 22 sites along the Tibetan Alpine Vegetation Transects (TAVT) during 1999-2000. The TAVT included the altitudinal transect on the eastern slope of the Gongga Mountains in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, with altitudes from 1900 m to 3700 m, and the longitudinal-latitudinal transect in the Central Tibetan Plateau, of approximately 1000 km length and 40 km width. Methods LAI was measured as the product of foliage biomass multiplied by the ratio of specific leaf area. NPP in forests and shrub communities was estimated as the sum of increases in standing crops of live vegetation using recent stem growth rate and leaf lifespan. NPP in grasslands was estimated from the above-ground maximum live biomass. We measured the soil organic carbon (C) and total and available nitrogen (N) contents and their pool sizes by conventional methods. Mean temperatures for the year, January and July and annual precipitation were estimated from available meteorological stations by interpolation or simulation. The threshold-like logistic function was used to model the relationships of LAI and NPP with climatic and soil variables. Results Geographically, NPP and LAI both significantly decreased with increasing latitude (P < 0.02), but increased with increasing longitude (P < 0.01). Altitudinal trends in NPP and LAI showed different patterns. NPP generally decreased with increasing altitude in a linear relationship (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001), whereas LAI showed a negative quadratic relationship with altitude (r(2) = 0.58, P < 0.001). Temperature and precipitation, singly or in combination, explained 60-68% of the NPP variation with logistic relationships, while the soil organic C and total N variables explained only 21-46% of the variation with simple linear regressions of log-transformed data. LAI showed significant logistic relationships with both climatic and soil variables, but the data from alpine spruce-fir sites diverged greatly from the modelled patterns associated with temperature and precipitation. Soil organic C storage had the strongest correlation with LAI (r(2) = 0.68, P < 0.001). Main conclusions In response to climatic gradients along the TAVT, LAI and NPP across diverse vegetation types converged towards threshold-like logistic patterns consistent with the general distribution patterns of live biomass both above-ground and below-ground found in our earlier studies. Our analysis further revealed that climatic factors strongly limited the NPP variations along the TAVT because the precipitation gradient characterized not only the vegetation distribution but also the soil N conditions of the natural ecosystems. LAI generally increased with increasing precipitation and was well correlated with soil organic C and total N variables. The interaction between LAI growth and soil N availability would appear to have important implications for ecosystem structure and function of alpine spruce-fir forests. Convergence towards logistic patterns in dry matter production of plants in the TAVT suggests that alpine plant growth would increase in a nonlinear response to global warming.",0
"A one year in situ experiment to quantify the flux of carbon, primarily as methane, from an overpressured thrust fault at the Cascadia convergent margin (ODP Site 892B) is described, Most of the expelled carbon Is sequestered in two solid phases, methane hydrate and authigenic carbonates and an unknown portion is lost in the water column and/or atmosphere, C-14 ages of clam shells from the vicinity of the site suggest active methane venting for at least 21-24 kyrs. The water column chemistry provides information on the potential effects of global warming on rapid massive gas hydrate dissociation and on the effects of microbial oxidation of the released methane on the local oceanic oxygen and CO2 contents. The local and global implications of these processes for the oceanic carbon cycle are being assessed.",0
"To assess the responses and plasticity of white spruce seedlings (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) to high temperatures, 12 open-pollinated families differing in growth performance were exposed to a 30-min heat treatment of 42, 44, 46, 48, or 50 degreesC with or without heat preconditioning at 38 degreesC for 5 h. Damage was evaluated based on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters after heat preconditioning, after the heat treatments and during a 7-day recovery period. Visible needle damage was also evaluated after the heat treatments and 14 days later. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicated that seedlings subjected to a heat treatment of 42-43 degreesC lost the ability to phosphorylate and donate water to photosystem II (PSII). A heat treatment of 44-46 degreesC severely limited the ability of the seedlings to use NADPK and ATP in the Calvin cycle. Based on visible needle damage, families with superior height-growth performance were more sensitive to heat stress than families with intermediate or inferior height-growth performance. Moreover, families with superior height-growth performance had low photochemical efficiencies in the light (DeltaF/F-m') after heat treatment. Heat preconditioning increased the thermotolerance of the seedlings. However, the data suggest that white spruce seedlings exhibiting fast-growing characteristics under present conditions may not grow as well at higher temperatures.",0
"In order to gain an insight into the effects of air temperature on river water quality, data were statistically analysed using meteorological and river water quality data. Two types of data set were used for river water temperature. One type involved five sampling points within different rivers where water temperature data were obtained daily, and the other involved 82 sampling points located within 27 rivers where water temperature and other water quality data were obtained monthly. Influential factors for different time scales were investigated. From the analyses, the gradient of water temperature to air temperature considered on a daily scale was 0.1-0.5 degreesC degreesC(-1) and was influenced by the hydrological scale of the river basin. The gradient observed using an annual scale was 0.5-5 degrees'C degreesC(-1) and was supposed to be influenced by solar radiation. Under the condition that solar radiation is constant, the gradient on an annual scale was predicted to be less than unity (0.5-0.85 degreesC degreesC(-1)). As for the other indices, from the analysis on an annual scale, an increase in air temperature resulted in an increase in biological oxygen demand and suspended solids, and a decrease in dissolved oxygen in almost all rivers. Based on the results, it was suggested that global warming has a deteriorating effect on river water quality. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",0
"Succulent plants are gradually colonizing the Croatian coast. These plants initially the collector's items, but when their ability to tolerate low temperatures was discovered, they began to be grown in the open. Since this species was often mentioned by Croatian Renaissance writers, it can be said with certainty that Opuntia sp. occurred in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic region as early as the 16(th) century, shortly after the discovery of America. Many of the Opuntia sp. and Agave americana plants developed spontaneously by adapting to the new ecological conditions. In fact, the American agave virtually became a symbol of some parts of the Croatian coast. Certain cacti species, such as C. Peruvians ""Monstruosus"", which may reach over 4 metres in height, manifest high resistance to cold and are frequently found along the Croatian coast. Due to global warming, some plants, such as Aptenia cordifolia, a species unheard of in these parts only some ten years ago, have acclimatized to the conditions and spread across the coastal area. Apart from these exotic succulents, the Croatian coast is also home to some European fat plants, such as Sedum sp-stonecrop, and Sempervivum sp.-houseleek Succulents are plants that thrive in stony areas. Still, we should be cautious not to over-plant them, since they impart an exotic appearance.",0
"Over half of California's water supply comes from high elevations in the snowmelt-dominated Sierra Nevada. Natural climate fluctuations, global warming, and the growing needs of water consumers demand intelligent management of this water resource. This requires a comprehensive monitoring system across and within the Sierra Nevada. Unfortunately, because of severe terrain and limited access, few measurements exist. Thus, meteorological and hydrologic processes are not well understood at high altitudes. However, new sensor and wireless communication technologies are beginning to provide sensor packages designed for low maintenance operation, low power consumption and unobtrusive footprints. A prototype network of meteorological and hydrological sensors has been deployed in Yosemite National Park, traversing elevation zones from 1,200 to 3,700 m. Communication techniques must be tailored to suit each location, resulting in a hybrid network of radio, cell-phone, land-line, and satellite transmissions. Results are showing how, in some years, snowmelt may occur quite uniformly over the Sierra, while in others it varies with elevation.",0
"In the present paper it is shown how profiles consisting of closely spaced (less than or equal to10 m) temperature measurements at shallow depth, obtained at several instances during one season, provide a detailed record of lateral variations in vertical groundwater flow. This is illustrated by a field study around the Peel Boundary Fault zone that cuts through the unconsolidated, siliciclastic deposits that occur in the southeastern part of Netherlands. This regionally important fault forms at many locations a strong barrier to horizontal groundwater flow and therefore induces complex groundwater flow patterns. Temperature anomalies (over 2degreesC) are observed over short distances. These anomalies reverse over the season. Numerical modeling of coupled groundwater flow and heat transport demonstrates how the temporal and spatial variations of subsurface temperature are the result of the interaction between seasonal fluctuations in surface temperature and spatial variations in groundwater flow. In addition to the horizontal profiles, temperature-depth profiles obtained in groundwater observation wells were used to constrain the larger-scale characteristics of the groundwater flow system. In order to simulate the observed geothermal patterns it appeared to be essential to account for the long-term changes in surface temperature. Although groundwater temperature data are commonly used to constrain groundwater flow fields on regional scale or to calculate vertical groundwater velocities at point locations beneath small streams, the present study is one of the first to integrate these different scales and incorporate the impact of recent climate change.",0
" There is a large discrepancy ( greater than 20%) between two recently published estimates of radiative forcing of four hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), two of which, HFC-23 and HFC-134a, are the most abundant HFCs in the atmosphere. We report an intercomparison, using two different radiative transfer methods, aimed at clarifying the forcing values for HFC-23 and HFC-134a, as well as HFC-227ea and HFC-32. The calculated global, annual mean radiative forcings differed by 12% or less and are within the expected errors in the radiative forcing estimates.",0
"Global climate change, i.e. higher and more variable temperatures, and a gain in soil salinity are increasing plant stress with direct consequences on crop yield and quality levels. Rice productivity is strongly affected by abiotic stress conditions. The regulation of chromatin structure in response to environmental stress is poorly understood. We investigated the interphase chromatin organization from rice plants in non-stress versus stress conditions. We have used a cytogenetic approach, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 45S, 55 rDNA and centromeric probes on rice tissue sections. The abiotic stress conditions included cold, heat and mild salinity and were applied during seed germination. In contrast to cold, saline and heat stresses caused extensive decondensation of 455 rDNA chromatin and also an increase in the distance between the 2 homologous 5S rDNA loci. 5-Azacytidine (5-AC), a DNA hypomethylating drug, greatly increased 455 rDNA chromatin decondensation and interestingly was able to induce polarization of centromeres in rice interphase nuclei. The abiotic stresses tested did not perturb the spatial position of centromeres, typically with circular arrangement around the nucleolus. The results suggest a role for chromatin plasticity in a world of climate changes. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel",0
"This paper presents the new ternary non-azeotropic mixture of R32/R125/R161 as an alternative refrigerant to R407C. The physical properties of the ternary mixture are similar to those of R407C, and it is environmental friendly, that is, it has zero ozone-depletion potentials (ODP) and lower global warming potentials (GWP) than R407C. Theoretical cycle performances of R32/R125/R161 and R407C are calculated and analyzed firstly. Based on the theoretical study, experimental tests are performed on a vapor-compression refrigeration system with a rotor compressor which was originally designed for R407C (without any modifications to system components for R407C). Experimental results under different working conditions indicate that the pressure ratio and power consumption of the new refrigerant are lower than those of R407C, and its refrigerating capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) are superior to those of R407C, respectively, and its discharge temperature is slightly higher than that of R407C. Therefore, the new refrigerant R32/R125/R161 could be considered as a promising refrigerant to R407C. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Global warming may affect the physiology, distributions, phenology and adaptations of plants and animals. In Israel, minimum summer temperatures increased by an average of 0.26 degreesC per decade during the second half of the 20th century. Bergmann's rule predicts that, in warm-blooded animals, races from warm regions are smaller than races from cold regions. Numerous studies have reported general correlations between body mass in fossil animals and independently established palaeoclimatic changes from various parts of the world in accordance with this rule. Using museum specimens, I tested the prediction that the body mass and tarsus length of five resident passerine species in Israel declined between 1950 and 1999. The body mass of four species (the graceful warbler Prinia gracilis, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, the yellow-vented bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos and the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala, but not of the crested lark Galerida cristata) declined significantly during this period. Tarsus length also declined significantly during this period for two species (the graceful warbler and the house sparrow). Body condition (body mass-to-tarsus length ratio) decreased in the Sardinian warbler, the yellow-vented bulbul and the crested lark. It is suggested that the above declines in body mass and tarsus length are due to global warming and also in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The above explanation does not exclude the possibility that other factors, such as a decrease in food availability, contributed to the decline in body mass. These declines may have serious implications for community structure and competition among bird species and may affect the survival of small passerines.",0
"We introduce very simple indices based on hourly mean values of geomagnetic components measured in observatories which we show can characterise many aspects of magnetic activity. When data from observatories with very long records (close to a century) are averaged over, say 11yr (the solar cycle), these indices display remarkably similar time variations, allowing us to define an ""overall magnetic trend' with smooth, decade long, variations separated by rather sharp extrema at 1956, 1968 and 1990. All 4 indices we propose (one for each component and a more complete one for the total vector variation) display essentially the same ""overall magnetic trend""for all components and all observatories. The curves are however not strictly affine, and ratios of similar indices from two observatories vary, again with the same ""overall magnetic trends, with amplitude variations up to 20%. Variations in our magnetic indices also correlate remarkably well with variations in classical, computationally more complex indices such as the magnetic index aa, with the sunspot (Wolf) number W, and solar irradiance S. This implies that both electromagnetic radiations and corpuscular flux in the vicinity of the Earth (whose original source lies in the Sun) are subject to the same variations; the current systems responsible respectively for the solar daily (regular) variation and irregular activity react roughly proportionally to the solar wind, due to corresponding changes in geometry of the magnetosphere. The ""overall magnetic trend'' bears some puzzling resemblances to long-term internal geomagnetic secular variations, with its discrete jerks. Finally, our indices and solar irradiance co-vary with long-term averages in global temperature of the lower atmosphere until approximately 1990, when the temperature curve sharply diverges upward. This lends support to the proposal that an anthropogenic component to the change in climate may not have been the dominant effect until the last decade of the XXth century. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

"Chemical risk assessment is fraught with difficulty due to the problem of accounting for the effects of mixtures. In addition to the uncertainty arising from chemical-to-chemical interactions, it is possible that environmental variables, such as temperature, influence the biological response to chemical challenge, acting as confounding factors in the analysis of mixture effects. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature on the response of fish to a defined mixture of estrogenic chemicals. It was anticipated that the response to the mixture may be exacerbated at higher temperatures, due to an increase in the rate of physiological processing. This is a pertinent issue in view of global climate change. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to the mixture in parallel exposure studies, which were carried out at different temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C). The estrogenic response was characterised using an established assay, involving the analysis of the egg yolk protein, vitellogenin (VTG). Patterns of VTG gene expression were also analysed using real-time QPCR. The results revealed that there was no effect of temperature on the magnitude of the VTG response after 2 weeks of chemical exposure. However, the analysis of mixture effects at two additional time points (24 h and 7 days) revealed that the response was induced more rapidly at the higher temperature. This trend was apparent from the analysis of effects both at the molecular and biochemical level. Whilst this indicates that climatic effects on water temperature are not a significant issue with regard to the long-term risk assessment of estrogenic chemicals, the relevance of short-term effects is, as yet, unclear. Furthermore, analysis of the patterns of VTG gene expression versus protein induction gives an insight into the physiological mechanisms responsible for temperature-dependent effects on the reproductive phenology of species such as roach. Hence, the data contribute to our understanding of the implications of global climate change for wild fish populations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Alpine environments are particularly susceptible to environmental changes associated with global warming but there is potential for alpine plants to adapt to warming if local adaptation occurs and gene flow allows genotypes adapted to low altitudes to colonize higher altitude sites. Here we examine the adaptive potential of a common alpine grass, Poa hiemata, within the restricted alpine habitat of Australian mountains, across a narrow altitudinal gradient replicated in three areas. Grasses at high altitude sites had shorter leaf lengths and larger circumferences than those at lower sites. Transplant experiments with clonal material and plants grown from seed indicated that these differences were partly genetic, with environmental and genetic factors both contributing to the differences between altitudes. Differences in altitudinal forms were also evident in a common garden experiment. Plants showed a home-site advantage in terms of survival. A fitness analysis indicated that at high altitude sites, selection favored plants with short leaves and larger circumferences, whereas these traits were selected in the opposite direction at the low altitude sites. These findings indicate cogradient selection and potential for both plastic and genotypic shifts in response to climate change in P. hiemata.",0
"Advanced thermal treatment technologies utilizing pyrolysis or gasification, as well as a combined approach, are introduced as sustainable methods to treat wastes in Singapore. Eight different technologies are evaluated: pyrolysis-gasification of MSW: pyrolysis of MSW; thermal cracking gasification of granulated MSW; combined pyrolysis, gasification and oxidation of MSW: steam gasification of wood: circulating fluidized bed (CFB) gasification of organic wastes; gasification of RDF; and the gasification of tyres. Life cycle assessment is carried out to determine the environmental impacts of the various waste conversion systems including global warming potential, acidification potential, terrestrial eutrophication and ozone photochemical formation. The normalization and weighting results, calculated according to Singapore national emission inventories, showed that the two highest impacts are from thermal cracking gasification of granulated MSW and the gasification of RDF; and the least are from the steam gasification of wood and the pyrolysis-gasification of MSW. A simplified life cycle cost comparison showed that the two most costs-effective waste conversion systems are the CFB gasification of organic waste and the combined pyrolysis, gasification and oxidation of MSW. The least favorable - highest environmental impact as well as highest costs - are the thermal cracking gasification of granulated MSW and the gasification of tyres. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Using a multi-model multi-scenario ensemble of integrations made for the forthcoming fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the frequency of occurrence of extreme seasonal temperatures at the end of the 21st Century is estimated. In this study an extreme temperature is defined as lying above the 95 percentile of the simulated temperature distribution for 20th Century climate. The model probability of extreme warm seasons is heterogeneous over the globe and rises to over 90% in large parts of the tropics. This would correspond to an average return period of such anomalous warm seasons of almost one year. The reliability of these results is assessed using the bounding box technique, previously used to quantify the reliability of seasonal climate forecasts. It is shown that the dramatic increase in extreme warm seasons arises from the combined effect of a shift and a broadening of the temperature distributions.",0
"The 17-year lower-tropospheric temperature record derived from the satellite Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)(1-3) shows a global cooling trend, from 1979 to 1995, of -0.05 K per decade at an altitude of about 3.5 km (refs 4, 5). Air temperatures measured at the Earth's surface, in contrast, have risen by approximately +0.13 K per decade over the same period(4,6). The two temperature records are derived from measurements of different physical parameters, and thus are not directly comparable. In fact, the lower stratosphere is cooling substantially (by about -0.5 K per decade)(5), so the warming trend seen at the surface is expected to diminish with altitude and change into a cooling trend at some point in the troposphere. Even so, it has been suggested that the cooling trend seen in the satellite data is excessive(4,7,8). The difficulty in reconciling the information from these different sources has sparked a debate in the climate community about possible instrumental problems and the existence of global warming(4,7,9). Here we identify an artificial cooling trend in the satellite-derived temperature series caused by previously neglected orbital-decay effects. We find a new, corrected estimate of +0.07 K per decade for the MSU-based temperature trend, which is in closer agreement with surface temperatures. We also find that the reported(7) cooling of the lower troposphere, relative to the middle troposphere, is another artefact caused by uncorrected orbital-decay effects.",0
"COASTAL PALAEOENVIRONMENTS DURING THE LAST 8000 YEARS ON THE LION GULF WESTERN SIDE: THE SAND BAR OF THE THAU COASTAL LAGOON (SETIF CORING, SETE, HERAULT) The present active lagoon system of the Than lagoon has begun shortly alter 7050 BP (5580-5255 cal BC). However, the setting up of the coastal system coupling sand bar and coastal lagoon took place probably before. This system belongs to a morphosystem dominated by the waves within a sedimentary context poor in sedimentary sources. The present erosion of this littoral echoes back to an ancient dynamics showing a backing of the sand bar joining the Mount Saint-Clair to the Pioch (Agde volcano) shortly after 6500 BP (5068-4660 cal BC). The pollen analysis of sequence SETIF reports this dynamic instability and allows its to outline the coastal vegetation evolution. The pollen sequence shows both the global warming and the palaeoecological and palaeogeographical changes that are characteristic of this coastal area. The local thermophilous feature of the life conditions linked to the Mount Saint-Clair, the perception of the offshore bar arrival, the fluctuations of the unsteady environments (sand bar, lagoon banks) and the different stages of human activities recorded since the ancient Neolithic are the main contributions of the SETIF palynological results. The observations related to the local relative sea level are consistent with the regional data. but show some peculiarities such as the perched characteristic of the salt water table forming the Than coastal palaeo-lagoon until 6540 40 BP (5068-4660 BC).",0
"In the next few years, grain legumes should be used as a mean of N acquisition in cropping systems due to the depletion of non-renewable sources of energy. However, this requires improvements in the accuracy with which biological N(2) fixation, N balances and the N benefit for following crops are estimated. Moreover, grain legume crops are largely influenced by water stress while the world area exposed to drought periods may increase in the coming years due to global warming. This work aims to quantify biomass and N accumulation, N partitioning between above and below ground parts and N rhizodeposition by a pea (Pisum sativum L.) when influenced by water stress. In a controlled environment, pea plants were exposed to a severe drought or not stressed, either at flowering or during pod filling. N rhizodeposition was measured using the split root method and plants were harvested at the end of flowering (59 days after sowing, DAS 59), at the end of the drought period applied during pod filling (DAS 74) and at maturity (DAS 101). Water stress strongly affected pea dry weight and N accumulation. In both stressed treatments, nodule biomass and N content were reduced by about 65% in the absence of stress. Regardless of the treatment, total below ground plant N (root N + N rhizodeposition; BGN) and N rhizodeposition were correlated with total plant N content and the proportion of BGN to total plant N was similar among treatments at each sampling date. At DAS 59 and 74, the N contained in rhizodeposits represented around 30% of the total BGN and increased to around 60% at maturity though BGN decreased from around 20 to 13% of the total plant N between DAS 74 and maturity. The results suggest that water stress has no specific effect on N partitioning between above and below ground parts. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Extreme rainfall events recently occurring in Korea have been shown to change frequency-based rainfall amounts quite significantly. Regardless of the reason for these extremes, the general concern of most hydrologists is how to handle these events for practical applications in Hydrology. Our study aim is to evaluate these extremes with their effect on frequency-based rainfall amounts, especially if they can be assumed to be within normal levels. As there is no commonly accepted methodology to be applied to this kind of study, we follow simplified steps such as: (1) estimation of the climatological variance of frequency-based rainfall amounts, (2) estimation of confidence intervals of frequency-based rainfall amounts (lower and upper bounds for the 5 and 1% significance levels estimated using the climatological variance), and (3) evaluation of the effect of extra rainfall events on the frequency-based rainfall amounts. Twelve stations on the Korean peninsula are selected as they have relatively longer data length. The annual maximum rainfall data collected from 1954 to 1998 are used. From this study we concluded that (1) at least 30 years of data length should be used for the frequency analysis in order to assure the stability of the variance of frequency-based rainfall amounts, (2) the climatological variances estimated all range from 5 to 8% of the frequency-based rainfall amounts, and (3) even though the frequency-based rainfall amount seems to become extreme with seemingly abnormal events, it still remains under its upper bound for the 5 or 1% significance levels estimated using the climatological variance, as well as it decays exponentially to the normal level as extra events are added. Thus, we conclude that we do not need to panic over seemingly abnormal events occurring so far, but just need to consider the variability inherent in frequency-based rainfall amounts.",0
"Individual species dispersal ability deserves special attention mainly because of negative impact of human induced changes on freshwater ecosystems. This study is focused on Central European dragonflies, because there is a high concentration of very experienced odonatologists in this region. It is more difficult to estimate dispersal ability of distant taxa than closely related spp. This study supports the widespread awareness of limited dispersal abilities of habitat generalists. Although there are a variety of life-history groups between both suborders, the majority of spp. with limited dispersal abilities are from the suborder Zygoptera. Mediterranean elements, often referred to as those expanding due to global warming, embody higher dispersal abilities than Siberian elements. Lentic spp. may benefit from the stable conditions of standing waters in comparison to lotic ones, although this preference is not so strong according to authors' analysis.",0
"Based on a quantitative study of the common fluctuations of C-14 and Be-10 production rates, we have derived a time series of the solar magnetic variability over the last 1200 years. This record is converted into irradiance variations by linear scaling based on previous studies of sun-like stars and of the sun's behavior over the last few centuries. The new solar irradiance record exhibits low values during the well-known solar minima centered at about 1900, 1810 (Dalton) and 1690 AD (Maunder). Further back in time, a rather long period between 1450 and 1750 AD is characterized by low irradiance values. A shorter period is centered at about 1200 AD, with irradiance slightly higher or similar to present day values. It is tempting to correlate these periods with the so-called ""little ice age"" and ""medieval warm period"", respectively. An accurate quantification of the climatic impact of this new irradiance record requires the use of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs). Nevertheless, our record is already compatible with a global cooling of about 0.5 1 degrees C during the ""little ice age"", and with a general cooling trend during the past millenium followed by global warming during the 20th century (Mann et al., 1999).",0
"This paper presents the results of an effort to test several novel chemistries for use as replacements for perfluoro-compounds in dielectric etch processes. Chemistries belonging to the hydrofluorocarbon and iodofluorocarbon families, namely, 2H-heptafluoropropane (CF3-CFH-CF3), iodotrifluoromethane (CF3I), 1-iodoheptafluoropropane (CF2I-CF2-CF3), and 2-iodoheptafluoropropane (CF3-3CFI-CF3) were tested in an Applied Materials Centura 5300 HDP etch tool, using a high aspect ratio silicon dioxide via etch application as the test vehicle. Designed experiment methodology was used in the evaluation. Effluent was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry. The performance of the alternative etchants in a high aspect ratio via etch process was compared to that of a standard chemistry on the Centura 5300 etch tool. Significant reductions in global warming emissions, relative to a perfluorinated baseline process, were found to be attainable with the alternative chemistries.",0
"Little is known about the effect of quaternary climate variations on organisms that inhabited carbonate islands of the Pacific Ocean, although it has been suggested that one or several uplifted islands provided shelter for terrestrial birds when sea-level reached its highest. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the history of colonization of the Tuamotu reed-warbler (Acrocephalus atyphus) in southeastern Polynesia, and found high genetic structure between the populations of three elevated carbonate islands. Estimates of time since divergence support the hypothesis that these islands acted as refugia during the last interglacial maximum. These findings are particularly important for defining conservation priorities on atolls that endure the current trend of sea-level rise owing to global warming.",0
"Freon propellants commonly referred to as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are involved in the destruction of the ozone layer. The countries participating in the Montreal Protocol voted in 1990 to require a phase-out of CFC production by the year 2000. In 1992, the phase-out was moved forward to 1996. There are two pharmaceutical consortia evaluating replacements for CFCs in metered dose inhalers (MDIs), which include the development of HFA-134a by IPACT-I and the development of HFA-227 by IPACT-II. Neither of these replacement propellants contains chlorine so they have no potential to destroy ozone. In addition, each of these new propellants has less global warming potential than currently used CFCs. The IPACT organizations have comprehensive testing programs developed from consultation with global regulatory authorities. These programs are largely complete with respect to subchronic evaluations and current work is focused on long-term evaluations. Results have indicated that the new propellants are extremely benign and have an equal or better safety profile than the CFCs they are meant to replace. With the safety of the new propellants becoming more evident with time, new formulations of existing aerosol drugs are being developed. This testing includes stand-alone safety evaluations as well as studies of the drug in new propellant formulations directly compared to current CFC formulations. Comparison studies have shown that the safety profile of the new formulations is not different from that of the CFC formulations. In summary, the availability and desirability of the use of CFCs in MDIs is limited. Fortunately several alternative propellants to the CFCs are approaching development finalization. The testing program has shown that these replacements are acceptable from a safety assessment perspective and their introduction will assure that vital MDI therapy will continue uninterrupted.",0
"Recent studies have shown that ice duration in lakes and rivers over the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the 19th and 20th centuries in response to global warming. However, lake ice trends have not been well documented in Canada. Because of its size, considerable variability may exist in both freeze-Lip and break-Lip dates across the country. In this paper, results of the analysis of recent trends (1951-2000) in freeze-up and break-up dates across Canada are presented. Trends toward earlier break-up dates are observed for most lakes during the time periods of analysis which encompass the 1990s. Freeze-up dates, on the other hand, show few significant trends and a low degree of temporal coherence when compared with break-up dates. These results are compared with trends in autumn and spring 0 degrees C isotherm dates over the time period 1966-95. Similar spatial and temporal patterns are observed, with generally significant trends toward earlier springs/break-up dates over most of western Canada and little change in isotherm and freeze-Lip dates over the majority of the country in autumn. Strong cot-relations (r > 0-5) between 0 degrees C isotherm dates and freeze-up/break-up dates at many locations across the Country reveal the high synchrony of these variables. These results ire also consistent with more recent observations of other cryospheric and atmospheric variables that indicate, in particular, a general trend toward earlier springs in the latter part of the 20th century. The results of this study provide further evidence of the robustness of lake ice as a proxy indicator of climate variability and change. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
"In estimating the climate change impacts on coastal regions, critical questions such as how many people live within one kilometer or below three-meter elevation along the coast are often raised. Surprisingly, answers to these questions are not available in the literature. This type of fine-scale estimates of population along the coast is necessary to provide a realistic measure of the population most vulnerable to hurricanes and sea-level rise. This paper utilized four published datasets and geographic information system (GIS) methods to retrieve the answers for the 23 coastal states in the conterminous United States. The results show that about 19 million people reside within one kilometer from the shoreline in the conterminous U.S., whereas about 16 million people live below three-meter elevation. The state-by-state estimates reveal that Florida has the highest percentage of population living in areas below three meters (32.5%; 5.9 million people), followed by Louisiana (27.6%; 2 million people). The same methodology can be applied worldwide to estimate the most vulnerable coastal population to global climate change.",0
"The musk ox is adapted to extreme cold and regarded as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Population decline is proposed to occur due to changes in forage availability, insect harassment, parasite load, and habitat availability, while the possible role of infectious diseases has not been emphasized. The goal of the present article is to describe an outbreak of fatal pasteurellosis that occurred in the introduced musk ox population of Dovrefjell, Norway in 2006, causing the death of a large proportion of the animals. The epizootic coincided with extraordinary warm and humid weather, conditions that often are associated with outbreaks of pasteurellosis. The description is based on long series of data from the surveillance of the musk ox population, weather data from a closely located meteorological station, and pathoanatomical investigation of the diseased animals. It is concluded that the weather conditions likely were the decisive factors for the outbreak. It is suggested that such epizootics may occur increasingly among cold-adapted animals if global warming results in increased occurrence of heat waves and associated extreme weather events, thereby causing population declines and possibly extinctions.",0
"Land-use/land-cover (LULC) change has been recognized as a key component in global climate change, and numerous climate modeling studies at regional to global scales document this. The research strategies have invariably been to first conduct baseline simulations of current conditions to evaluate model performance. Then simulation of regional climate with land cover changes (LCC) implemented within the model allows differences with the baseline simulation to be used as evidence of global to regional-scale climate impacts of LCC. However, even state-of-the-art regional climate models require two data sets to conduct reasonable baseline simulations. These are representative current land cover and atmospheric information over the study region. In frontier and developing areas (where most of the rapid land-use conversion is taking place), these data sets are frequently unavailable and the errors in simulations are due to either inaccurate land cover, insufficient atmospheric information, nonrepresentative model physics, or a combination of one or more of the above. This study shows that in one frontier region, that surrounding the Cordillera de Tilaran of Costa Rica, the accuracy of simulating clouds decreases by 1% to 3% if default model land cover information is used. If the atmospheric data sets used are the ones usually available to researchers (with land cover information held constant), then the model accuracy is reduced by 21% to 25%. Model runs without updated land cover or atmospheric information reduce model accuracy slightly further. Precipitation comparisons also provide similar results. This study thus shows that the critically important data set for conducting accurate simulations is not land cover information but atmospheric information. Researchers may similarly get significant increase in the accuracy of their baseline simulations elsewhere by using radiosondes/rawinsondes over their study region. Finally, since atmospheric information is not available for different landscape scenarios, assessments of the relative role of LULC change will have to continue to rely on using the standard atmospheric data set and the acceptance that the use of more detailed atmospheric data to initialize and provide lateral boundary conditions would have reduced the uncertainties in such landscape sensitivity studies.",0
"Soil salinisation is very often due to irrigation excess, however irrigation is absolutely needed for obtaining reliable crop yields, particularly under the global warming conditions forecasted for the next years. A simple methodology for assessing the salinisation risk for any water management solution and under future global warming conditions is presented. The methodology is tested in San Antonio del Sur Valley, at the southeast of Cuba. Irrigation from a new dam will support agriculture in the Valley, but at the same time soil salinity is expected to be incremented. Soil electrical conductivity at several depths and topographical altitudes were stored in a Geographic Information System (GIS), determining the actual borders of the saline zones and the water-table depths by a GIS analysis. The physically based model SWAP was used to predict the new water table depths. The meteorological variables, needed as input in the hydrological model, were obtained changing linearly the daily values of a typical year, according to a global change forecast for the zone. The soil hydraulic properties were calculated from Pedotransfer functions, using soil physical data obtained in measurements made in the Valley. The simulated results predict a fast water-table raise of about 1 m, due to the increment of irrigation water. The new saline zones under these conditions were calculated through a Digital Terrain Model. The original saline zones of the Valley will be enlarged from 31,4 to 96,8 ha 15 years after the scheduled irrigation starts. The methodology could be applied for farmers and decision-makers in order to select the most suitable water management solution considering both economical and environmental criteria.",0
"About four million cases of foodborne infectious disease occur annually in Australia; new foodborne pathogens, such as enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, are emerging. Climate change, combined with changes in how we produce and distribute food and how we behave as consumers, have the potential to affect foodborne disease in the coming century. Foodborne disease outbreaks are now more far-reaching (and sometimes global) due to modern mass food production and widespread food distribution. There are strong seasonal patterns for Salmonella and Campylobacter infection in Australia. Global warming may increase the incidence of infections, such as salmonellosis, and diseases caused by toxins, such as ciguatera.",0
"Macquarie Island is the southernmost limit to the distribution of the black rat Rattus rattus. The species was introduced to this subantarctic island by sealers during the 19th century. The rats are now widespread and abundant in coastal areas all around the island. The distribution of rat populations is divided into discrete units by the availability of suitable habitat which, in turn, is a consequence of the rugged topography, particularly on the west coast. Rats are found from almost sea level to 200-250 m a.s.l. and up to 1 km inland. They have adapted successfully to the rigorous climate and firmly occupy a habitat niche in an environment where food is plentiful, predators are few and interspecific competition minimal. The principal habitat, tall Poa foliosa tussock grassland, provides year-round shelter and food. Rats dig burrows in the peaty stools of the tussock plants and construct nesting chambers at the base of the dense leaf canopy. Predictably, this provides a warmer and more stable thermal environment than that experienced outside under the tussock canopy where the runs are located. Tussock grasslands are spreading under the influence of management control measures directed at the introduced European rabbit and possibly global warming. Management programmes are also directed towards the eradication of feral cats. In response, rat populations may be expected to expand in numbers and to occupy new territories. Without control this may, in the long term, have serious consequences for the island's avifauna, particularly the smaller, burrow-nesting species.",0
"Loess deposits in eastern Beringia contain continuous proxy records of the effects of past climatic change on terrestrial landscapes at high latitudes. Variations of environmental magnetism and sedimentology of high-latitude loess deposits indicate that the timing and pattern of responses to local variations in wind intensity, storminess, and pedogenesis in eastern Beringia closely resemble the pattern of global climate change during the Late Quaternary deduced from studies of marine and ice core records. The age of paleoclimatic fluctuations, permafrost features, volcanic ash horizons, buried forest layers and paleosols, and other features of the eastern Beringian loess record can be determined using a variety of Quaternary dating methods. Tephrochronologic correlations between the loess record and the glacial history of eastern Beringia indicate the Delta Glaciation occurred during marine isotope stage 6. Several other middle and Late Quaternary glaciations across eastern Beringia can be tephrochronologically tied to the loess record, and appear to have been in phase with episodes of global cooling recorded in deep-sea records.

"To date, all altered patterns of seasonal interactions observed in insects, birds, amphibians, and plants associated with global warming during the latter half of the 20th century are explicable as variable expressions of plastic phenotypes. Over the last 30 years, the genetically controlled photoperiodic response of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, has shifted toward shorter, more southern daylengths as growing seasons have become longer. This shift is detectable over a time interval as short as 5 years. Faster evolutionary response has occurred in northern populations where selection is stronger and genetic variation is greater than in southern populations. W. smithii represents an example of actual genetic differentiation of a seasonality trait that is consistent with an adaptive evolutionary response to recent global warming.",0
"Northern Eurasia, the largest land-mass in the northern extratropics, accounts for similar to 20% of the global land area. However, little is known about how the biogeochemical cycles, energy and water cycles, and human activities specific to this carbon-rich, cold region interact with global climate. A major concern is that changes in the distribution of land-based life, as well as its interactions with the environment, may lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of accelerated regional and global warming. With this as its motivation, the Northern Eurasian Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI) was formed in 2004 to better understand and quantify feedbacks between northern Eurasian and global climates. The first group of NEESPI projects has mostly focused on assembling regional databases, organizing improved environmental monitoring of the region, and studying individual environmental processes. That was a starting point to addressing emerging challenges in the region related to rapidly and simultaneously changing climate, environmental, and societal systems. More recently, the NEESPI research focus has been moving toward integrative studies, including the development of modeling capabilities to project the future state of climate, environment, and societies in the NEESPI domain. This effort will require a high level of integration of observation programs, process studies, and modeling across disciplines.",0
"Background: Significant shifts in climate are considered a threat to plants and animals with significant physiological limitations and limited dispersal abilities. The southern Appalachian Mountains are a global hotspot for plethodontid salamander diversity. Plethodontids are lungless ectotherms, so their ecology is strongly governed by temperature and precipitation. Many plethodontid species in southern Appalachia exist in high elevation habitats that may be at or near their thermal maxima, and may also have limited dispersal abilities across warmer valley bottoms. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a maximum-entropy approach (program Maxent) to model the suitable climatic habitat of 41 plethodontid salamander species inhabiting the Appalachian Highlands region (33 individual species and eight species included within two species complexes). We evaluated the relative change in suitable climatic habitat for these species in the Appalachian Highlands from the current climate to the years 2020, 2050, and 2080, using both the HADCM3 and the CGCM3 models, each under low and high CO2 scenarios, and using two-model thresholds levels (relative suitability thresholds for determining suitable/unsuitable range), for a total of 8 scenarios per species. Conclusion/Significance: While models differed slightly, every scenario projected significant declines in suitable habitat within the Appalachian Highlands as early as 2020. Species with more southern ranges and with smaller ranges had larger projected habitat loss. Despite significant differences in projected precipitation changes to the region, projections did not differ significantly between global circulation models. CO2 emissions scenario and model threshold had small effects on projected habitat loss by 2020, but did not affect longer-term projections. Results of this study indicate that choice of model threshold and CO2 emissions scenario affect short-term projected shifts in climatic distributions of species; however, these factors and choice of global circulation model have relatively small affects on what is significant projected loss of habitat for many salamander species that currently occupy the Appalachian Highlands.",0
"A total of more than 140 000 kg of small-magnitude rockfall deposits was measured in eight rockfall collectors of altogether 940 m(2) in size between 1999-2003 below a 400-600 m high rock face in the Reintal, German Alps. Measurements were conducted with a temporal resolution up to single days to attribute rockfall intensity to observed triggering events. Precipitation was assessed by a rain gauge and high-resolution precipitation radar. Intense rainstorms triggered previously unreported rockfall intensities of up to 300 000 g/(m(2)h) that we term ""secondary rockfall event."" In comparison to dry periods without frost (10(-2) g/(m(2)h)), rockfall deposition increased by 2-218 times during wet freeze-thaw cycles and by 56-thousand to 40-million times during secondary rockfall events. We obtained three nonlinear logistic growth models that relate rockfall intensity [g/(m(2)h)] to rainfall intensity [mm/h]. The models account for different rock wall intermediate storage volumes, triggering thresholds and storage depletion. They apply to all rockfall collector positions with correlations from R(2)=0.89 to 0.99. Thus, the timing of more than 90% of the encountered rockfall is explained by the triggering factor rainfall intensity. A combination of rockfall response models with radar-supported storm cell forecast could be used to anticipate hazardous rockfall events, and help to reduce the exposure of individuals and mobile structures (e.g. cable cars) to the hazard. According to meteorological recordings, the frequency of these intense rockfall events is likely to increase in response to global warming.",0
"Through its nonlinear dynamics and involvement in past abrupt climate shifts the thermohaline circulation (THC) represents a key element for the understanding of rapid climate changes. The expected THC weakening under global warming is characterized by large uncertainties, and it is therefore of significant importance to identify ocean circulation changes over the last century. By applying various statistical techniques on two global sea surface temperature datasets two THC-related modes are separated. The first one involves relatively slow adjustment of the whole conveyor belt circulation and has an interhemispherically symmetric pattern. The second mode is associated with the relatively fast adjustment of the North Atlantic overturning cell and has the seesaw structure. Based on the separation of these two patterns the authors show that the global conveyor has been weakening since the late 1930s and that the North Atlantic overturning cell suffered an abrupt shift around 1970. The distinction between the two modes provides also a new frame for interpreting past abrupt climate changes.",0
"The steady sailing performance of a sail-assisted bulk carrier is investigated utilising towing-tank derived hydrodynamic derivatives and wind tunnel measured aerodynamic properties of the sails and the ship. The aerodynamic characteristics investigated include the ship hull at the fullyloaded draught, the sail-sail interaction effects for two sets of four identical hybrid-sails, and the sail-hull interaction effects for the same two sets of identical sails in the presence of the selected bulk carrier hull-form. This is in addition to lift-drag measurements of single isolated sails of each shape. The form of the two sets of soft sails was rectangular and triangular. This paper is concerned with assessing the benefits of a sail-assisted ship operation, and hence a steady-state rather than complete time-domain integrations of the governing equations are reported. The results of the completed analysis suggest that the benefits of the derived sail generated driving force are greater than the overhead of equipping the ship with a selected system of hybrid-sails. Sail-assisted ships could represent an important contribution to an improving global environment by reducing the demands for a driving force through the propeller.",0
"In 2001 and 2002, fluxes of N2O, CH4, CO2 and N-2 were measured in two constructed wetlands (CW) for domestic wastewater treatment in Estonia. The difference between the median values of N2O, CH4, and N-2 fluxes in the horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) CWs was nonsignificant, being 3-4 and 4-4.1 mg m(-2) d(-1) for N2O-N and CH4-C, and 0.16-0.17 g N m(-2) d(-1) for N-2-N respectively. The CO2-C flux was significantly lower (0.6 g C m(-2) d(-1)) in one of the HSSF filters of a hybrid CW, whereas the single HSSF and VSSF filters emitted 7 and 2.0 g C m(-2) d(-1). The median value of CH4-C emission in CWs varied from 4 to 42.6 g C m(-2) d(-1), being significantly higher in the VSSF filter beds. We also estimated C and N budgets in one of the HSSF CWs (312.5 m(2)) for 2001 and 2002. The total C input into this system was similar in 2001 and 2002, 772 and 719 kg C year(-1), but was differently distributed between constituent fluxes. In 2001, the main input flux was soil and microbial accumulation (663 kg C year(-1) or 85.8% of total C input), followed by plant net primary production (NPP) (10.2%) and wastewater inflow (3.9%). In 2002, 55.7% of annual C input was bound in plant NPP, whereas the increase in soil C formed 28.5% and wastewater inflow 15.7%. The main C output flux was soil respiration, including microbial respiration from soil and litter, and the respiration of roots and rhizomes. It formed 120 (97.5%) and 230 kg C year(-1) (98.2%) in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The measured CH4-C flux remained below 0.1% of total C output. The HSSF CW was generally found to be a strong C sink, and its annual C sequestration was 649 and 484 kg C year(-1) per wetland in 2001 and 2002 respectively. However, negative soil and microbial accumulation values in recent years indicate decreasing C sequestration. The average annual N removal from the system was 38-59 kg N year(-1) (46-48% of the initial total N loading). The most important flux of the N budget was N-2-N emission (22.7 kg in 2001 and 15.2 kg in 2002), followed by plant belowground assimilation (2.3 and 19 kg N year(-1) in 2001 and 2002), and above-ground assimilation (9 and 9.2 kg N year(-1), respectively). N2O emission was low: 0.37-0.60 kg N year(-1) (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Relatively few studies have investigated plant responses to the combined effects of multiple environmental factors. We studied the responses of canola (Brassica napus) seedlings to combinations of temperatures (22 degrees/18 degrees C and 28 degrees/24 degrees C), ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation levels (5 [ambient] and 10 [enhanced] kJ m(-2) d(-1)), and watering regimes (well watered and water stressed). The higher temperature decreased stem diameter, leaf area, individual organ and total-plant dry mass (DM), net CO(2) assimilation (AN), water use efficiency (WUE), the chlorophyll (Chl) a-Chl b ratio, and UV-absorbing compounds but increased specific leaf mass (SLM), leaf mass ratio (LMR), shoot-root ratio (SRR), and Chl b. Enhanced UVB reduced leaf number and area, DM accumulation, SLM, LMR, AN, WUE, carotenoids, and Chl a : Chl b but increased leaf area ratio, SRR, and ethylene evolution. Water stress decreased plant growth, leaf moisture, leaf, stem, and total DM, LMR, SRR, and gas exchange but increased photosynthetic pigments, UV-absorbing compounds, epicuticular wax, and ethylene evolution. Many plant parameters were affected by two-and three-way interactions. Main factors and their interactions revealed that water stress has a larger negative influence on plants than the other two factors. We suggest that, under conditions of global climate change, water stress may have a stronger effect on plant performance than UVB radiation.",0
"A tree ring width chronology constructed from multiple samples taken from Chinese pine trees growing in outskirts of Shenyang city in Liaoning Province (China) was studied for the first time in relation to solar activity, global surface air temperature anomalies and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The work revealed an excellent response of urban tree growth to solar activity and global climate change, show as the time variation of the main periodicities in the Sun-Earth indices and its corresponding variation as recorded in tree rings, indicating that these urban Chinese pine are a suitable proxy for Sun-Earth system research in heavy industrial region, like Fuling Mausoleum that is located in Shenyang. Chinese pines show significant synchronous response to solar activity, in the periodic band 5-8 years, 10-16 years and 20-30 years. At the same time, the wave signal of tree growth was also affected, or even amplified by the combined effect of the PDO and GSATA with a short lag time, revealing 6, 13.2, 16.6 and 23.2 years oscillatory modes. At 20-30 years timescales, Chinese pines validated the strongest PDO and GSATA influence signal at 26 years and 20.8 years, respectively, and the 20.8 years fluctuation of GSATA may be the first cause of the tree ring 23.5 years periodic waves. Urban tree ring growth is also more sensitive to low periodicity, especially in the 2-5 years band width. (C) 2006 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Determining trend and implementing detrending operations are important steps in data analysis. Yet there is no precise definition of ""trend"" nor any logical algorithm for extracting it. As a result, various ad hoc extrinsic methods have been used to determine trend and to facilitate a detrending operation. In this article, a simple and logical definition of trend is given for any nonlinear and nonstationary time series as an intrinsically determined monotonic function within a certain temporal span (most often that of the data span), or a function in which there can be at most one extremum within that temporal span. Being intrinsic, the method to derive the trend has to be adaptive. This definition of trend also presumes the existence of a natural time scale. All these requirements suggest the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method as the logical choice of algorithm for extracting various trends from a data set. Once the trend is determined, the corresponding detrending operation can be implemented. With this definition of trend, the variability of the data on various time scales also can be derived naturally. Climate data are used to illustrate the determination of the intrinsic trend and natural variability.",0
"Large pieces of standing or fallen dead wood, known as coarse woody debris (CWD), play important roles in temperate forest carbon and nutrient cycles, and affect the abundance and distribution of many classes of organisms. CWD biomass and inputs are poorly documented in tropical rain forests (TRF), and the causes for their variation at landscape-scales in this biome have not been studied. We quantified standing and fallen CWD stocks and inputs in upland (non-swamp) old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We used a network of 18 0.5 ha plots sited in three edaphic conditions to analyze soil nutrient effects on CWD stocks and inputs controlling for topography, and to examine topographic effects controlling for soil nutrients. The edaphic conditions were flat inceptisols. flat ultisols, and steep ultisols. Chemical analyses confirmed the existence of an almost three-fold gradient in total P and K in the upper I m of soil. We also annually censused all live woody stems greater than or equal to10 cm diameter above buttresses in each plot in September/October from 1997 to 2000 to obtain data on stand structure and dynamics. Fallen CWD stocks averaged 46.3 Mg ha(-1) (22.3 Mg C ha(-1)), while standing CWD averaged 6.5 Mg ha(-1) (3.1 Mg C ha(-1)). There were no significant differences in volume or mass of standing or fallen CWD among edaphic conditions. Annual inputs of CWD averaged 4.9 Mg ha(-1) (2.4 Mg C ha(-1)). Tumover time of fallen CWD was ca. 9 year. Neither stocks nor inputs were correlated with stand structure (number of trees per plot, plot basal area, or plot estimated above-ground biomass). Potential differences in CWD stocks and inputs among sites with different edaphic conditions may have been obscured by a 10-fold variation in tree mortality among plots and a two-fold variation in mean CWD input among years. Analysis of sample variance showed that stocks of CWD were adequately sampled with the 18 0.5 ha plot design. but that inputs were measured with low precision. At La Selva fallen and standing CWD stocks together equaled ca. 33% of estimated above-ground live woody biomass. Tropical rain forest CWD and its associated carbon are intermediate in pool size and turnover rate between fine litter and live trees. Our results show that scaling up TRF CWD estimates to larger spatial scales may be more constrained by the quality of data obtained over single landscapes than by variation due to zonal soil nutrient and topographic conditions. Both the magnitude and vagility of TRF CWD pools are likely to change with global climate change, but the overall direction of change is uncertain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Q(10) is the most important index of soil respiration, and is essential for accurate prediction of soil carbon response to global warming. The response of soil carbon storage is an issue on global and regional scales. In this study, published Q(10) values of soil respiration in Japanese forests were examined (n = 44). The Q(10) values ranged from 30 to 3.45, and the mean value was 2.18 (SD = 0.61, median = 2.02). These results were slightly lower than those of global compilations. The number of studies of Q(10) values is still lacking, especially with regard to those in managed forests, those in northeast Japan, and those using modern measurement techniques such as infrared gas analysis. For accurate prediction of soil carbon dynamics and storage in Japanese forests, more such studies are required.",0
"The global warming associated with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) ca. 55.5 Myr ago is the most dramatic identified short-term temperature increase of the Cenozoic. One direct consequence of a warming world is a rise in sea level, due primarily to the thermal expansion of water as oceans warmed. The Kumara-2 core, South Island, New Zealand, spans the Paleocene/Eocene transition and provides a rare southern hemisphere continental margin record of the PETM. Lithology, palynology and compound-specific stable isotope compositions of higher plant leaf wax n-alkanes reveal a 4.85 m PETM and a carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of ca. -4.5%., larger than the -2.5 to -3.5%. CIEs generally recorded by deep sea foraminifera. There is a shift from a terrestrial to a marine, potentially anoxic, sedimentary depositional environment at the base of the PETM, interpreted as being the result of a local sea level rise. Coincident with the onset of the CIE is the appearance of pollen associated with thermophilic conditions and the development of Nypa mangrove swamps. Moreover, there is a reorganisation of the angiosperm pollen assemblage during the PETM, and an initial increase in fern spores and decrease in gymnosperms. Crucially, all of these changes occur below the horizon characterised by the most negative delta C-13 values, suggesting that: 1) the recorded negative excursion of 4.5% may indeed reflect the shift in atmospheric CO2 isotopic composition; and 2) that the large input of C-13-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system was not geologically instantaneous, with at least some of the added carbon lagging warming, sea level rise and vegetation change. Furthermore, compound-specific hydrogen isotope analyses show a large degree of variability both directly before and during the CIE, suggesting that the PETM in New Zealand was characterised by complex and transient changes in the hydrological regime, similar to those reported in North America, the Arctic and Eastern Africa. Thus, the new PETM record from Kumara-2 reveals local climatic and biotic responses, driven by a combination of global warming and the consequential change in local depositional environment induced by sea level rise.

"Caribou are an integral component of high-latitude ecosystems and represent a major subsistence food source for many northern people. The availability and quality of winter habitat is critical to sustain these caribou populations. Caribou commonly use older spruce woodlands with adequate terrestrial lichen, a preferred winter forage, in the understory. Changes in climate and fire regime pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of this important winter habitat. Computer simulations performed with a spatially explicit vegetation succession model (ALFRESCO) indicate that changes in the frequency and extent of fire in interior Alaska may substantially impact the abundance and quality of winter habitat for caribou. We modeled four different fire scenarios and tracked the frequency, extent, and spatial distribution of the simulated fires and associated changes to vegetation composition and distribution. Our results suggest that shorter fire frequencies (i.e., less time between recurring fires) on the winter range of the Nelchina caribou herd in eastern interior Alaska will result in large decreases of available winter habitat, relative to that currently available, in both the short and long term. A 30% shortening of the fire frequency resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the area burned annually and an associated 41% decrease in the amount of spruce-lichen forest found on the landscape. More importantly, simulations with more frequent fires produced a relatively immature forest age structure, compared to that which currently exists; with few stands older than 100 years. This age structure is at the lower limits of stand age classes preferred by caribou from the Nelchina herd. Projected changes in fire regime due to climate warming and/or additional prescribed burning could substantially alter the winter habitat of caribou in interior Alaska and lead to changes in winter range use and/or population dynamics.",0
"Pressure-mole fraction phase diagrams for the CO2-water system at temperatures between 278.15 and 298.15 K and pressures up to 30 MPa, which correspond to those of ocean waters at depths to 3000 m, are developed based on the literature data and experimental results obtained by the authors. The resultant phase diagrams can serve as a basis for analyzing the phase behavior of liquid CO2 and CO2 hydrate disposed of in the ocean as a means to mitigate global warming.",0
"Numerous long-term trends in the rate-of-change in monthly mean Great Lakes water levels are identified for the period 1860 to 1998. Statistically significant trends are found for 2, 4, 5, and 7 months of the year for Lakes Superior, Michigan-Huron, Erie, and Ontario, respectively. Many of the trends translate into large changes in net water flux (600 to 1,700 m(3)/s). In each case, significant positive trends are roughly offset by negative trends during other times of the year. Together with similar trends in monthly lake level anomalies (deviations from the annual mean), these trends indicate important changes in the seasonal cycle of Great Lakes water levels. Specifically, Lakes Erie and Ontario are rising and falling (on an annual basis) roughly one month earlier than they did 139 years ago. Maximum lake levels for Lake Superior are also slightly earlier in the year, and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of Lake Ontario is found to increase by 23% over the 139-year period. Some of the changes are consistent with the predicted impacts of global warming on spring snowmelt and runoff in the Great Lakes region. Other potential contributors to the observed trends include seasonal changes in precipitation and human induced effects such as lake regulation and changes in land use.",0
"The main purpose of this study is to investigate and evaluate the impact of climate change on the runoff and water resources of Yongdam basin, Korea. First, we construct global climate change scenarios using the YONU GCM control run and transient experiments, then transform the YONU GCM grid-box predictions with coarse resolution of climate change into the site-specific values by statistical downscaling techniques. The downscaled values are used to modify the parameters of a stochastic weather generator model for the simulation of the site-specific daily weather time series. The weather series is fed into a semi-distributed hydrological model called SLURP to simulate the streamflows associated with other water resources for the condition of 2CO(2). This approach is applied to the Yongdam dam basin in the southern part of Korea. The results show that under the condition of 2CO(2), about 7.6% of annual mean streamflow is reduced when it is compared with the current condition. Seasonal streamflows in the winter and autumn are increased, while streamflow in the summer is decreased. However, the seasonality of the simulated series is similar to the observed pattern",0
"Trace fossil assemblages from the latest Paleocene to the earliest Eocene were significantly affected by the environmental perturbation of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). High-resolution ichnological analysis shows well marked different ichnological features pre-, syn-, and post-event. A well developed normal, tiered burrowing community is present in the sediments below the PETM, indicating oxic conditions and normal benthic food availability. During the PETM the record of trace fossil producers disappeared gradually but rapidly, reflecting the global increase in temperature, and the concentration of benthic food in the very shallow surface layer and, probably, the local depletion of oxygen within the sediments, although probably not true anoxia. The environmental perturbation significantly affected the whole benthic habitat, as shown by the correspondence with the main phase of the benthic foraminiferal extinction. After the PETM, the normal, tiered burrowing community recovered gradually and slowly, in a delayed return to pre-PETM environmental conditions. The changes in the trace fossil assemblage thus document the impact of the PETM on the macrobenthic community, a decline in oxygen levels during the PETM in a globally perturbed habitat due to global warming and the similarities and differences in the response of micro- and macrobenthic communities to global phenomena. Thus, ichnological analysis reveals as a very useful additional tool to understanding atmosphere-ocean dynamic during PETM and a potential way in future climate research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Global climate change is expected to impact biological populations through a variety of mechanisms including increases in the length of their growing season. Climate models are useful tools for predicting how season length might change in the future. However, the accuracy of these models tends to be rather low at regional geographic scales. Here, I determined the ability of several atmosphere and ocean general circulating models (AOGCMs) to accurately simulate historical season lengths for a temperate ectotherm across the continental United States. I also evaluated the effectiveness of regional-scale correction factors to improve the accuracy of these models. I found that both the accuracy of simulated season lengths and the effectiveness of the correction factors to improve the model's accuracy varied geographically and across models. These results suggest that regional specific correction factors do not always adequately remove potential discrepancies between simulated and historically observed environmental parameters. As such, an explicit evaluation of the correction factors' effectiveness should be included in future studies of global climate change's impact on biological populations.",0
"Global climate change may alter soil temperature and moisture conditions, increasing the need to understand how these basic factors affect C dynamics. This is particularly important in boreal forests, which often have large C pools in the forest floor and mineral horizons. We examined the effects of temperature and precipitation frequency on C dynamics in forest floor horizons from eight red spruce sites in the northeastern U.S. using column leaching experiments. Intact and sieved forest floor samples were incubated at 3, 10 or 20 degrees C and leached either daily, once per week, or twice per week during 14 to 39 days using simulated throughfall solutions (pH 2.7 or 4.0). Leachate DOC and CO2 production were measured along with soil C and N concentrations. For intact samples, losses of C as DOC and as CO2 increased with increasing temperature, and the increase (Q(10)) was usually greater between 3 and 10 degrees C than between 10 and 20 degrees C. There was a greater response of CO2 to temperature than of DOC (e.g. Howland sieved soil Q(10)s of 9 and 7.2 for CO2 and 5 and 2.0 for DOC at 3-10 and 10-20 degrees C ranges, respectively). More frequent leaching increased steady state DOC mobilization (e.g. 145 and 58 mu g g(-1) forest floor d(-1) for daily and weekly leachings at 10 degrees C, respectively), but not CO2 evolution (e.g. 79 and 74 mu g CO2-C g(-1) forest floor d(-1) for daily and weekly leachings at 10 degrees C, respectively). Across the eight sites DOC loss and CO2 evolution varied by factors of 3.6 and 4.0, respectively. Both CO2 evolution and DOC in leachates calculated as fluxes were correlated (r = 0.73 and 0.87 respectively, n = 8) with the C-to-N ratios of the samples (C-to-N ratios ranged from 27 to 58), which could be explained by N limitations that triggered selective lignin degradation, differences in degree of humification of the material, or position on a west-to-east pollution gradient. Although higher temperatures and more frequent leaching increased DOC mobilization, and higher temperatures increased CO? evolution, both treatments and site to site variation illustrate the complexity of the response of forest-floor C pools to manipulations.

"Amphibians are declining globally at unprecedented rates. To direct conservation efforts, global amphibian assessments are being conducted to characterize biodiversity and evolutionary relationships among species, as well as amphibian population and species' health. Modern molecular methods are facilitating such characterization, and we highlight techniques for rapidly increasing the availability of data for making taxonomic distinctions. When diversity is characterized, and populations and the species most vulnerable to declines or extinctions are identified, it is then critical to understand factors causing declines to develop mitigation strategies. We discuss molecular approaches and their applications for addressing some of the leading hypotheses for amphibian declines, including habitat loss, emerging infections diseases, chemical contaminants, and global climate change.",0
"Temperatures in southwestern North America are projected to increase 3.5-4 degrees C over the next 60-90 years. This will precipitate ecological shifts as the ranges of species change in response to new climates. During this shift, rapid-colonizing species should increase, whereas slow-colonizing species will at first decrease, but eventually become reestablished in their new range. This successional process has been estimated to require from 100 to over 300 years in small areas, under a stable climate, with a nearby seed source. How much longer will it require on a continental scale, under a changing climate, without a nearby seed source? I considered this question through an examination of the response of fossil plant assemblages from the Grand Canyon, Arizona, to the most recent rapid warming of similar magnitude that occurred at the start of the Holocene, 11,700 years ago. At that time, temperatures in southwestern North America increased about 4 degrees C over less than a century. Grand Canyon plant species responded at different rates to this warming climate. Early-successional species rapidly increased, whereas late-successional species decreased. This shift persisted throughout the next 2700 years. I found two earlier, less-extreme species shifts following rapid warming events around 14,700 and 16,800 years ago. Late-successional species predominated only after 4000 years or more of relatively stable temperature. These results suggest the potential magnitude, duration, and nature of future ecological changes and have implications for conservation plans, especially those incorporating equilibrium assumptions or reconstituting past conditions. When these concepts are extended to include the most rapid early-successional colonizers, they imply that the recent increases in invasive exotics may be only the most noticeable part of a new resurgence of early-successional vegetation. Additionally, my results challenge the reliability of models of future vegetation and carbon balance that project conditions on the basis of assumptions of equilibrium within only a century.",0
"Sulfate aerosol particles have strong scattering effect on the solar radiation transfer which results in increasing the planet albedo and, hence, tend to cool the earth-atmosphere system. Also, aerosols can act as the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) which tend to increase the albedo of clouds and cool the global warming. The ARPEGE-Climat version 3 AGCM with FMR radiation scheme is used to estimate the direct and indirect radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols. For minimizing the uncertainties in assessing this kind of cooling effect, all kinds of factors are analyzed which have been mixed in the assessment process and may lead to the different results of the radiative forcing of aerosols, It is noticed that one of the uncertainties to assess the climate forcing of aerosols by GCM results from the different definition of radiative forcing that was used. In order to clarify this vague idea, the off-line case for considering no feedbacks and on-line case for including all the feedbacks have been used for assessment. The direct forcing of sulfate aerosols in off-line case is -0.57 W/m(2) and -0.38 W/m(2) for the clear sky and all sky respectively. The value of on-line case appears to be a little larger than that in off-line case chiefly due to the feedback of clouds. The indirect forcing of sulfate aerosols in off-line case is -4 W/m(2) and -0 W/m(2) in on-line case. The radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols has obvious regional characteristics, There is a larger negative radiative forcing over North America, Europe and East Asia. If the direct and indirect forcing are added together, it is enough to offset the positive radiative forcing induced by the greenhouse gases in these regions.",0
"Pimelea ferruginea Labill., a spring-flowering woody perennial from Western Australia, is distributed coastally from Albany (latitude 35 degrees 11'S) to just below Geraldton (latitude 29 degrees 07'S). Clones developed from cuttings, taken from single plants of Pimelea ferruginea at sites covering the range of its distribution, were grown vegetatively for up to 6 months in a naturally lit glasshouse and then transferred to a range of temperatures for induction of flowering. Selections from cooler, southerly sites (33-35 degrees S latitude) flowered with a low temperature optimum (12-15 degrees C average) but remained vegetative at a 3 degrees C higher temperature (18 degrees C). By contrast, northerly selections (29-30 degrees S latitude) tolerated 3-5 degrees C warmer conditions for their flowering. Daylength effects were of minor importance relative to the response to cool temperature with short (10 h) days being marginally more favourable than long days (16 h). In the wild, Pimelea ferruginea flowers in spring (September-October) after experiencing winter temperatures comparable to those effective in controlled environments. To define field flowering response, at the beginning of winter, vegetative six-month-old plants of the various selections were transferred to a southerly, intermediate or northerly field nursery site in Western Australia. The differences in flowering response across sites and selections broadly matched the temperatures needed for flowering of the selections in controlled environments. These physiological differences in regulation of flowering indicate ecotypic adaptation to temperature over the latitudinal range of distribution of this species of Pimelea. The field transfer experiments highlight the overriding inductive effect of cool winter temperatures in determining flowering time. Furthermore, any rise of 2-4 degrees C in winter temperature due to global warming could have serious consequences for floral initiation and for survival of P. ferruginea.",0
"The North Atlantic is one of the few places on the globe where the atmosphere is linked to the deep ocean through air-sea interaction. While the internal variability of the atmosphere by itself is only predictable over a period of one to two weeks, climate Variations are potentially predictable for much longer periods of months or even years because of coupling with the ocean. This work presents details from the first study to quantify the predictability for simulated multidecadal climate variability over the North Atlantic. The model used for this purpose is the GFDL coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model used extensively for studies of global warming and natural climate variability. This model contains fluctuations of the North Atlantic and high-latitude oceanic circulation with variability concentrated in the 40-60 year range. Oceanic predictability is quantified through analysis of the time-dependent behavior of large-scale empirical orthogonal function (EOF) patterns for the meridional stream function, dynamic topography, 170 m temperature, surface temperature and surface salinity. The results indicate that predictability in the North Atlantic depends on three main physical mechanisms. The first involves the oceanic deep convection in the subpolar region which acts to integrate atmospheric fluctuations, thus providing for a red noise oceanic response as elaborated by Hasselmann. The second involves the large-scale dynamics of the thermohaline circulation, which can cause the oceanic variations to have an oscillatory character on the multidecadal time scale. The third involves nonlocal effects on the North Atlantic arising from periodic anomalous fresh water transport advecting southward from the polar regions in the East Greenland Current. When the multidecadal oscillatory variations of the thermohaline circulation are active, the first and second EOF patterns for the North Atlantic dynamic topography have predictability time scales on the order of 10-20 y, whereas EOF-1 of SST has predictability time scales of 5-7 y. When the thermohaline variability has weak multidecadal power, the Hasselmann mechanism is dominant and the predictability is reduced by at least a factor of two. When the third mechanism is in an extreme phase, the North Atlantic dynamic topography patterns realize a 10-20 year predictability time scale. Additional analysis of SST in the Greenland Sea, in a region associated with the southward propagating fresh water anomalies, indicates the potential for decadal scale predictability for this high latitude region as well. The model calculations also allow insight into regional variations of predictability, which might be useful information for the design of a monitoring system for the North Atlantic. Predictability appears to break down most rapidly in regions of active convection in the high-latitude regions of the North Atlantic.",0
Concerning global warming and resource depletion the impact of buildings in subtropical regions is becoming even greater due to a high growth rate of urbanized areas From the viewpoint of building physics the main problem concerning subtropical climate is the high level of humidity in combination with high temperature In this study a flexible building envelope consisting of wood and clay components was developed so that the materials and the assemblies can be easily tailored to comply with local climatic conditions The movement and accumulation of moisture in the wall was of prime concern This has been investigated by means of testing full scale walls in a climate chamber and the corresponding one dimensional transient heat and transfer simulation In order to achieve a consistency between calculation and measurement the individual materials were tested for their hygric and thermal properties Based on these findings attempts were made to calculate the behavior of an optimized wall assembly under real climatic conditions of central Japan As a result it was shown that the hygrothermal behavior of the envelope is predictable by means of the models and the simulation program used and that no risk of interstitial condensation and mold growth was predicted under the real climatic conditions of Kyoto (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved,0
"The origins of South America's exceptional plant diversity are poorly known from the fossil record. We report on unbiased quantitative collections of fossil floras from Laguna del Hunco ( LH) and Rio Pichileufu (RP) in Patagonia, Argentina. These sites represent a frost-free humid biome in South American middle latitudes of the globally warm Eocene. At LH, from 4,303 identified specimens, we recognize 186 species of plant organs and 152 species of leaves. Adjusted for sample size, the LH flora is more diverse than comparable Eocene floras known from other continents. The RP flora shares several taxa with LH and appears to be as rich, although sampling is preliminary. The two floras were previously considered coeval. However, (40)Ar/(39)Ar dating of three ash-fall tuff beds in close stratigraphic association with the RP flora indicates an age of 47.4 +/- 0.05 Ma, 4.5 million years younger than LH, for which one tuff is 0.05 reanalyzed here as Ma. Thus, diverse floral associations 591 +/- 0.22 in Patagonia evolved by the Eocene, possibly in response to global warming, and were persistent and areally extensive. This suggests extraordinary richness at low latitudes via the latitudinal diversity gradient, corroborated by published palynological data from the Eocene of Colombia.",0
"The accelerating rate of change in biodiversity patterns, mediated by ever increasing human pressures and global warming, demands a better understanding of the relationship between the structure of biological communities and ecosystem functioning (BEF). Recent investigations suggest that the functional structure of communities, i.e. the composition and diversity of functional traits, is the main driver of ecological processes. However, the predictive power of BEF research is still low, the integration of all components of functional community structure as predictors is still lacking, and the multifunctionality of ecosystems (i.e. rates of multiple processes) must be considered. Here, using a multiple-processes framework from grassland biodiversity experiments, we show that functional identity of species and functional divergence among species, rather than species diversity per se, together promote the level of ecosystem multifunctionality with a predictive power of 80%. Our results suggest that primary productivity and decomposition rates, two key ecosystem processes upon which the global carbon cycle depends, are primarily sustained by specialist species, i.e. those that hold specialized combinations of traits and perform particular functions. Contrary to studies focusing on single ecosystem functions and considering species richness as the sole measure of biodiversity, we found a linear and non-saturating effect of the functional structure of communities on ecosystem multifunctionality. Thus, sustaining multiple ecological processes would require focusing on trait dominance and on the degree of community specialization, even in species-rich assemblages.",0
"Coral reefs are thought to face significant threat from global warming due to increased water temperatures and ocean acidity. However, research into the surface energy balance of coral reefs and their associated micrometeorology is rare. Here we present, through a case study approach, the first direct in situ measurements of the surface energy balance of Heron Reef, a small platform coral reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Surface energy exchanges were measured using the eddy covariance method and show that during winter and spring an estimated 80-98% of net radiation goes into heating of the water overlaying the reef and reef substrate. As a result, cloud cover is considered the dominant control on heating of the reef flat environment. Change in cloud cover may therefore significantly affect the thermal environment of coral reefs and their ecology. Sensible and latent heat fluxes reached their highest values during wintertime advection of dry and cool continental air blowing from mainland Australia. This resulted in a net loss of energy from the reef flat and a decreasing trend in water temperature. Turbulent fluxes otherwise remained small, with sensible heat flux often close to zero. Results indicate that coral reefs may act as heat sinks during winter and as heat sources during spring, thereby affecting local water and atmosphere heat budgets and associated thermodynamics.",0
"Global models project impending climate changes that could significantly alter plant species composition in ecosystems. Climate manipulation experiments provide an opportunity to investigate such effects. Here we describe and apply a method for extracting the age-detrended growth rate of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) and show that experimental ecosystem warming enhances the growth rate of this shrub. Snowmelt date, not soil temperature or moisture, is demonstrated to be the dominant climate variable controlling the observed effect. Our findings suggest that global climate change will result in increased growth and range expansion of sagebrush near northern or high-elevation range boundaries in the Western United States.",0
"Making decisions in natural resource management involves an understanding of the risk and uncertainty of the outcomes, such as crop failure or cattle starvation, and of the normal spread of the expected production. Hedging against poor outcomes often means lack of investment and slow adoption of new methods. At the household level, production instability can have serious effects on income and food security. At the national level, it can have social and economic impacts that may affect all sectors of society. Crop models such as CERES-Maize are excellent tools for assessing weather-related production variability. WATBAL is a water balance model that can provide robust estimates of the potential growing days for a pasture. These models require large quantities of daily weather data that are rarely available. MarkSim is an application for generating synthetic daily weather files by estimating the third-order Markov model parameters from interpolated climate surfaces. The models can then be run for each distinct point on the map. This paper examines the growth of maize and pasture in dryland agriculture in southern Africa. Weather simulators produce independent estimates for each point on the map; however, we know that a spatial coherence of weather exists. We investigated a method of incorporating spatial coherence into MarkSim and show that it increases the variance of production. This means that all of the farmers in a coherent area share poor yields, with important consequences for food security, markets, transport, and shared grazing lands. The long-term aspects of risk are associated with global climate change. We used the results of a Global Circulation Model to extrapolate to the year 2055. We found that low maize yields would become more likely in the marginal areas, whereas they may actually increase in some areas. The same trend was found with pasture growth. We outline areas where further work is required before these tools and methods can address natural resource management problems in a comprehensive manner at local community and policy levels.",0
"Dune systems are essential to the ecological balance and sediment inputs of coastal environments and they provide numerous environmental services; however, their existence is threatened by natural and human stressors that contribute to their degradation. Future impacts are expected to be greater because of global climate change in association with further rises in sea level. Beaches and dune systems occupy large areas along the coastline of the state of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico. The aim of this study is to establish the intrinsic vulnerability of nine dune fields in Veracruz to current and future impacts and to assess their integrated management status. These dune-beach systems are more vulnerable to the effects of economic activities and land use change than to those induced by natural forces. Results show that six of these dune systems have medium vulnerability and an ecological conservation policy should be adopted; the other three, with high or very high vulnerability, are candidates for a restoration policy.",0
"Laterites and bauxites and their associated Ultisols and Oxisols are widespread in warm-wet climates today, and their spread to high latitudes has been attributed to episodes of past global warming. Bauxitic paleosols from the Early Eocene Monaro Volcanics of southeastern Australia have been claimed as exceptions formed in a cool-wet climate. Re-examination and chemical analysis of a sequence of intrabasaltic paleosols in the Bega no. 7 core of radiometrically dated Monaro Volcanics now show highly variable paleotemperature and precipitation. The core includes 53 successive paleosols, mostly nonbauxitic, but bauxitic paleosols reveal local spikes in warmth and precipitation coincident with early Eocene (55-, 52-, 51-, and 48-Ma) global spikes of warmth, precipitation, and high atmospheric CO2. These bauxitic paleosols thus formed in warm-wet, not cool-dry, climates, and their poleward spread coincided with global greenhouse spikes.",0
"Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas displaying multiple physiological functions in plants, animals and bacteria. The enzymes nitrate reductase and NO synthase have been suggested to be involved in the production of NO in plants and algae, but the implication of those enzymes in NO production under physiological conditions remains obscure. Symbiodinium microadriaticum, commonly referred to as zooxanthellae, is a marine microalga commonly found in symbiotic association with a cnidarian host including reef-building corals. Here we demonstrate NO production in zooxanthellae upon supplementation of either sodium nitrite or L-arginine as a substrate. The nitrite-dependent NO production was detected electrochemically and confirmed by the application of 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), a specific NO scavenger. Cells stained with the diaminofluorescein, DAF-2 DA, an NO fluorescent probe, showed an increase in fluorescence intensity upon supplementation of both sodium nitrite and L-arginine. Microscopic observations of DAF-stained cells verified that NO was produced inside the cells. NO production in S. microadriaticum was found to increase upon exposure of cells to an acute heat stress which also caused a decline in the photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)). This study provides substantial evidence to confirm that zooxanthellae can synthesize NO even when they are not in a symbiotic association with a coral host. The increase in NO production at high temperatures suggests that heat stress stimulates the microalgal NO production in a temperature-dependent manner. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of the coral bleaching phenomenon which is associated with elevated sea surface temperature due to global warming.",0
"This study investigates long-term changes in Baiu rainfall in Eastern and Western Japan using daily precipitation records at 37 stations for the years 1901 through 2009, focusing on its seasonal progress. This period is much longer than various data analyzed in previous observational studies. In the early Baiu season (early to mid June), significant long-term decreasing trends are observed in Eastern and Western Japan, accompanying large inter-decadal variation in the former half of the 20th century. In the late Baiu season (mid to late July), in contrast, significant long-term increasing trends are observed on the Japan Sea side of Eastern and Western Japan. No significant trends are recognized either in the mid Baiu season (late June to early July) or in the entire Baiu season (June to July) over all regions. It is interesting to note that the observed tendency of delayed Baiu withdrawal in the last 109 years, when global warming has been in progress, is similar to its future changes projected by climate models.",0
"Populations of arctic-alpine plants at the southern periphery of their range should respond rapidly to projected global warming. We established a study to monitor the density and reproductive effort of six such species in tundra of Glacier National Park, Montana to help project the fate of these species in the center of their range. For many species, detecting long-term population trends is confounded by short-term variation. Our study design employs temporal resampling of permanent plots on multiple sites and a repeated-measures model that accommodates the effects of high frequency variation and allows assessment of the significance of long-term trends. Statistical analysis compares site-specific estimates of annual mean density between two time periods and uses between-plot, within-site, within-year variation to estimate error. Power calculations using data from the 3-yr baseline period indicate that measurements of fecundity will be less sensitive for detecting long-term trends than measurements of plant density. Furthermore, our results suggest that perennial species of closed-turf communities may be better bioassays of long-term change than annuals or species of open, ephemeral microsites.",0
"Climate change is likely to present new and substantially unpredictable challenges to human societies. The prospect is of particular concern at the local and regional levels, since vulnerability and adaptive capacity are location-specific and many decisions regarding climate-induced risks are made at those levels. In this light, one is compelled to survey stakeholders' understandings of their situation and perceived problems. Assessments should also include the context of other ongoing changes, such as globalisation, that will impact communities and exacerbate their vulnerabilities. This paper presents an assessment of vulnerability and adaptive capacity in the forestry sector in the Pite River basin in northern Sweden. The study was carried out using a multi-method design encompassing literature surveys, interviews with stakeholders, and stakeholder meetings. The paper concludes that while climate change will have an impact on the region, its effect will be superseded by that of broader socio-economic changes. The results illustrate the need to understand local and regional perceptions of adaptation in formulating appropriate policy measures.",0
"The incidence of natural disturbance in forests is increasing globally as a consequence of global warming. The concomitant large-scale transformation of landscapes can have profound social impacts and trigger political conflict that hampers resource management. This paper explores the link between landscape transformations and political conflict using the example of the bark beetle epidemic in Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. For a significant part of the local population, the bark beetle represented a threat to their homeland and the post-disturbance landscape of dead wood reflected the dominance of outside interests in land management. This resentment sparked the formation of a local political movement, which was successful in pressing for changes in the current land management policy that were based on the ideal of a green forest landscape that needed to be protected by human intervention. An alternative interpretation of the post-disturbance landscape, however, welcomed it as a step towards authentic wilderness and opposed interventions to control the bark beetle. These contrasting understandings of the post-disturbance landscape underpin the protracted political conflict over the appropriate management of natural disturbance that has been smouldering for more than 20 years. The article concludes that it is vital to understand the cultural meaning of landscapes before adopting a disturbance management policy in order to avoid paralysing political conflict and social unrest.

"Climate change is expected to impact on many aspects of building performance, with much of the existing and future building stock likely to be affected. Potential impacts of climate change on buildings are identified, evaluated as to how serious they might be, and actions are considered to ensure that future building performance is not compromised. Climate change scenarios for New Zealand defined the scale of climate changes considered for building performance. For each climate variable, relevant aspects of building performance were examined to determine if there is likely to be a significant impact. Where significant impacts were indicated, they were studied in detail and quantified where possible. A risk-profiling tool was formulated to cover the risk/severity of the most significant climate change impacts, which include flooding, tropical cyclones and overheating. Adaptation strategies were developed for each climate change impact, with different responses appropriate for each impact. Mitigation of greenhouse emissions is also addressed. For those risks where delaying action has serious consequences, it may be appropriate to consider changes in building or zoning regulations to anticipate the future impacts of climate change. Some implications for future building performance, design, standards and regulation are discussed.",0
A summary is given of available chlorophyll data and statistical relationships between chlorophyll and primary production off the south and west coast of South Africa. An attempt is made to quantify the extent of the 'productive' coastal area and to give an idea of its variation and the implications of this at higher trophic levels. We then speculate on the implications of regional global warming in this regard. Proposals for monitoring chlorophyll distributions are also discussed.,0
"Species restricted to the higher altitudes of low mountain ranges in Central Europe are among the species threatened. To quantify the influence of climate warming, we analysed the altitudinal distribution of mollusc species and modelled the occurrence and distribution of a high montane species under two scenarios of climate warming. Our analysis is based on samples of 3,437 individuals and 46 species collected at 111 localities. Number of individuals and species decreased with altitude. The slope of this decrease changed between 1,100 and 1,200 m a.s.l., which is the ecotone between mixed montane beech-fir-spruce and high-altitude spruce forests. In contrast to the majority of species and the number of species, the occurrence of Semilimax kotulae (Westerlund 1883), a Central European endemic, increased with altitude. Again, we found a change in the slope between 1,100 and 1,200 m a.s.l. Using geostatistical models of local temperature as well as spatial GLMs with Poisson and Gaussian errors, we modelled altitudinal distribution of diversity and species under consideration of environmental variables. Especially habitat age was an important predictor for the abundance of many species. For the high montane species S. kotulae, our model predicts a decrease in occurrence and abundance with global warming. Although global warming will lead to an overall increase in number of species, species occurring only at higher elevations, such as the S. kotulae, will probably become extinct within the study area.",0
"The Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) breeds across the boreal forest zone of North America and winters throughout the eastern United States. Over the past four decades, the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the Christmas Bird Count have shown high rates of population decline ranging from approximately 5 to 12% per year. Regional surveys suggest declines and range retractions in the southern boreal zone. Analyses of historical accounts suggest that the Rusty Blackbird's abundance has been dropping steadily for over a century. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the decline. The species relies on wooded wetlands throughout the year, so loss and degradation of these habitats-particularly in the winter range-is a prime suspect. Blackbird-control programs may have contributed. In recent decades, habitat disturbance, global warming, and environmental contamination in the boreal zone may have taken their toll on breeding populations. In 2005, the International Rusty Blackbird Working Group was formed to develop research efforts toward understanding the mysterious decline. This special section presents the group's research findings-the first on the species' use of breeding and winter habitat, reproductive success, parasite prevalence, patterns of molt, and migratory connectivity. Data on the levels of methylmercury in tissues and the role of timber management on reproductive success are intriguing. We outline research needed for assessment of the roles of various factors in causing the decline of the Rusty Blackbird.",0
"The long-term advance in the timing of bird spring migration in the Northern Hemisphere is associated with global climate change. The extent to which changes in bird phenology reflect responses to weather conditions in the wintering or breeding areas, or during migration, however, remains to be elucidated. We analyse the relationships between the timing of spring migration of 9 species of trans-Saharan migratory birds across the, Mediterranean, and thermal and precipitation anomalies in the main wintering areas south of the Sahara Desert and in North African stopover areas. Median migration dates were collected on the island of Capri (southern Italy) by standardized mist-netting during 1981 to 2004. High temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa (Sahel and Gulf of Guinea) prior to northward migration (February and March) were associated with advanced migration. Moreover, birds migrated earlier when winter rainfall in North Africa was more abundant. The relationships between relevant meteorological variables and timing of migration were remarkably consistent among species, suggesting a coherent response to the same extrinsic stimuli. All these results were obtained while statistically controlling for the long-term trend towards the earlier timing of spring migration across the Mediterranean that has been documented in previous analyses of the same dataset, a trend that was confirmed by the present analyses. In conclusion, our results suggest that thermal conditions in the wintering quarters, as well as rainfall in North African stopover areas, can influence interannual variation in migration phenology of trans-Saharan migratory birds, although the ecological mechanisms that causally link meteorological conditions to the timing of migration remain a matter of speculation.",0
"Accurate knowledge of the response of root turnover to a changing climate is needed to predict growth and produce carbon cycle models. A soil warming system and shading were used to vary soil temperature and received radiation independently in a temperate grassland dominated by Holcus lanatus L. Minirhizotrons allowed root growth and turnover to be examined non-destructively. In two short-term (8 week) experiments, root responses to temperature were seasonally distinct. Root number increased when heating was applied during spring, but root death increased during autumnal heating. An experiment lasting 12 months demonstrated that any positive response to temperature was short-lived and that over a full growing season, soil warming led to a reduction in root number and mass due to increased root death during autumn and winter. Root respiration was also insensitive to soil temperature over much of the year. In contrast, root growth was strongly affected by incident radiation. Root biomass, length, birth rate, number and turnover were all reduced by shading. Photosynthesis in H. lanatus exhibited some acclimation to shading, but assimilation rates at growth irradiance were still lower in shaded plants. The negative effects of shading and soil warming on roots were additive. Comparison of root data with environmental measurements demonstrated a number of positive relationships with photosynthetically active radiation, but not with soil temperature. This was true both across the entire data set and within a shade treatment. These results demonstrate that root growth is unlikely to be directly affected by increased soil temperatures as a result of global warming, at least in temperate areas, and that predictions of net primary productivity should not be based on a positive root growth response to temperature.",0
"Production of rape methyl ester (RME) can be carried out with different systems solutions, in which the choice of system is usually related to the scale of the production. The purpose of this study was to analyse whether the use of a small-scale RME production system reduced the environmental load in comparison to a medium- and a large-scale system. To fulfil this purpose, a limited LCA, including air-emissions and energy requirements, was carried out for the three plant sizes. For small plants and physical allocation, the global warming potential was 40.3 g CO2-eq/MJ(fuel), the acidification potential 236 mg SO2-eq/MJ(fuel), the eutrophication potential 39.1 Mg PO43--eq/MJ(fuel), the photochemical oxidant creation potential 3.29 Mg C2H4-eq/MJ(fuel), and the energy requirement 295 kJ/MJ(fuel). It was shown that the differences in environmental impact and energy requirement between small-, medium- and large-scale systems were small or even negligible. The higher oil extraction efficiency and the more efficient use of machinery and buildings in the large-scale system were, to a certain degree, outweighed by the longer transport distances. The dominating production step was the cultivation, in which production of fertilisers, soil emissions and tractive power made major contributions to the environmental load. The results were, however, largely dependent on the method used for allocation of the environmental burden between the RME and the by-products meal and glycerine. This indicates that when different biofuels or production strategies are to be compared, it is important that the results are calculated with the same allocation strategies and system limitations.

"It is becoming apparent that the correlation of clouds at different altitudes with cosmic rays and solar activity is a matter of complexity. Specifically, evidence has been presented favouring particular regions of the Earth having positive or negative correlations of cloud cover with respect to cosmic rays and to solar irradiation. In this work we examine the evidence critically from several standpoints and conclude that the evidence for a negative correlation of low and a positive correlation for middle cloud cover with solar irradiance (as measured by UV) over a significant fraction of the Earth (20-30%) is good. No other claimed correlations are Supported. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Several bird species have advanced the timing of their spring migration in response to recent climate change. European short-distance migrants, wintering in temperate areas, have been assumed to be more affected by change in the European climate than long-distance migrants wintering in the tropics. However, we show that tong-distance migrants have advanced their spring arrival in Scandinavia more than short-distance migrants. By analyzing a long-term data set from southern Italy, we show that long-distance migrants also pass through the Mediterranean region earlier. We argue that this may reflect a climate-driven evolutionary change in the timing of spring migration.",0
"Numerous studies have demonstrated that both global patterns and local details of permafrost distribution are highly responsive to climatic fluctuations, at several temporal and spatial scales. Permafrost currently underlies about one fourth of the land area of the northern hemisphere, and many qualitative predictions have been made for a severe reduction of this area in response to global warming. A map of permafrost distribution compiled using the 'frost index', a dimensionless number that can be related to the zonal arrangement of permafrost, shows very good correspondence with a recently published empirical map. The frost index was used in conjunction with three transient general circulation models to compile maps of permafrost zonation for conditions in the mid-21st century. Although regional patterns and local details differ substantially between the three scenarios, all result in reductions in the area occupied by each permafrost zone. Localized expansions of the area underlain by permafrost are apparent from two of the scenarios. Reductions in the areal extent of equilibrium permafrost predicted from two of the three transient models are much less than those indicated by runs using 2 x CO models.",0
"The carbon isotopic composition (C-12, C-13 and C-14) of atmospheric CH4 was studied to estimate CH4 sources in local areas. In urban areas of Nagoya, Japan (35 degrees 10'N, 136 degrees 55'E), where there is much anthropogenic influence, evidence of methane release into the atmosphere has been reported. Variations in the carbon isotopic composition were analyzed with diurnal fluctuation of atmospheric CH4 concentration, since the diurnal increase in the CH4 concentration is attributed mainly to release from local sources. In November and December 1993, the contribution of fossil CH, to local CH, released from the urban area was calculated to be 102 +/- 8%, and delta(13)C was -40.8 +/- 3.0 parts per thousand. Leakage of supplied natural gas and exhaust gas from automobiles would he important CH, sour;es in the urban area in late autumn to winter. In suburban areas ill Japan there are many rice paddy fields, and these are one kind of major anthropogenic source of atmospheric CH4. In a suburban area of Nagoya fossil, CH4 contributed to less than 10% of local release in July and august 1994. The calculated value of delta(13)C for non-fossil CH4 was approximately - 65 parts per thousand, which is within the range of reported values of delta(13)C for CH4 derived from bacterial CH4 sources such as irrigated rice paddies.

"The antioxidant quercetin was extracted from yellow onion waste and converted to its aglycone form by a combination of subcritical water extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis. The hydrolytic step was catalysed by a double residue (N221S, P342L) mutant of the thermostable beta-glucosidase (TnBgl1A), isolated from the thermophile Thermotoga neapolitana and cloned and produced in E. coli. The activity of wt TnBgl1A was shown to be dependent on the position of the glucosylation on the quercetin backbone, favouring hydrolysis of quercetin-4'-glucoside over quercetin-3-glucoside. The mutated variant of the enzyme harboured a mutation in the +2 sub-site (N221S) and showed increased catalytic efficiency in quercetin-3-glucoside hydrolysis and also to a certain extent hydrolysis of quercetin-4'-glucoside. The mutated enzyme was used directly in yellow onion extracts, prepared by subcritical water extraction, resulting in complete hydrolysis of the glucosylated flavonoids quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, quercetin-4'-glucoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, isorhamnetin-4'-glucoside and isorhamnetin-3,4'-diglucoside. To complete hydrolysis within five minutes, 3 mg of TnBgl1A_N221S was used per gramme of onion (dry weight). A life cycle assessment was done to compare the environmental impact of the new method with a conventional solid-liquid extraction-and-hydrolysis method utilising aqueous methanol and hydrochloric acid. Comparison of the methods showed that the new method is preferable regarding primary energy consumption and global warming potential. Another advantage of this method is that handling of toxic chemicals (methanol and HCl) is avoided. This shows that combined subcritical water extraction/enzyme hydrolysis is both a fast and sustainable method to obtain quercetin from onion waste.",0
"Emerald, north-east Queensland, is at the northern margin of the wheat cropping region of Australia. The Emerald region was previously used predominantly for grazing beef cattle; however, cropping has developed in importance over the past 30 years. We use historical climate records (1890-1998) to simulate and compare wheat yields, grass production and live-weight gain (LWG) over time. The cropping expansion from the 1970s to the early 1990s has occurred in a unique period in the 108-year record with the highest average wheat yields, lowest wheat yield variability and the greatest relative productivity of wheat production against grass production. If this window of opportunity is a result of long-term climate variability, then cropping is likely to decline in the region as conditions return to those experienced earlier in the record. If this increase is related to climate change, then cropping is likely to persist in the region with productivity maintained at current levels particularly through the yield-enhancing effects of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, this persistence will be influenced by the frequencies of El Nino conditions that may increase with global warming. The high relative productivities experienced over the past few decades have probably biased producers' expectations, and applications for drought support need to take into account the longer-term perspective provided by this analysis. Nevertheless, the last 6 years have the lowest simulated mean LWG production on the record. The identification of poor production periods depended on the production element being addressed and the timescale involved. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Nycthemeral rhythm is an important biological trait that allows animals to escape predation and competition and, conversely, to coincide with mutualists. Although laboratory studies have shown that the rhythm depends on both endogenous factors and cyclic environmental cues, the latter is often poorly understood, particularly in the wild. Because insects are mostly ectothermal organisms, their activity rhythm is often thought to depend directly on ground temperature. In Mediterranean habitats, Cataglyphis ants are well known for their unusual thermoresistance, allowing them to forage in summer at the central hours of the day when the ground reaches temperatures that are lethal to their competitors. However, we show that the rhythm of Cataglyphis floricola in south-western Spain is governed by light cues rather than by temperature. First, variations in ant traffic at the nest entrance were better explained by solar elevation angle than by ground temperature on both seasonal and daily scales. Second, if ants waited for the ground to reach a threshold temperature to start their activity, we would expect similar temperatures regardless of the opening hour. However, we found a significant increase in ground temperature as opening hour got later in the day. Third, by using a simple experimental set-up that increased the apparent solar elevation over the nest entrance, we provoked a delay of nest closure time. We discuss the relevance of these results with respect to the life history of Cataglyphis species and their possible consequences in relation to global warming.",0
"The early consequences of global climate change (GCC) are well documented. However, future impacts on ecosystem health, and on the health of humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, are much less well understood. Evidence of increasing frequency of extreme weather events (the 2003 trans-European heat wave, extended droughts in Australia and South America), of geographic changes in vector-borne disease (bluetongue and hanta. viruses emerging in northern Europe, dengue virus expanding in central and northern America), and of altered animal behavioral responses (changes in bird migration patterns and fishery numbers) warrants action. To make valid choices, however, practitioners and decision makers must understand what is known about GCC and what is only theory. There will be a multitude of microbial, vector, and host responses to climate change, for example, and not all organisms will respond similarly or across equal time scales. Unfortunately, for many organisms and ecosystems the scientific community has a relatively poor understanding of current effectors and balances, making it problematic to describe the current situation, let alone to validate future predictions. The need for enhanced basic research and systematic surveillance programs is obvious, but putting such programs into place is daunting. However, the threats are real and fast approaching. What is done in the next few years may be decisive, whether for the good or the ill of all.",0
"Permian and Triassic carbonate platforms of the Arabian Peninsula (Gondwana) and seamounts of the Neo-Tethys (Hawasina and Batain basins) are characterized by distinctive supersequences (second order, duration 5-20 million years, my) and composite sequences (third order, duration 0.5-5 my). The presented sequence stratigraphic framework will be compared with existing sea level curves to discuss the validity of different regional oscillations during the dispersal of Pangea. The carbonate succession of the Haushi and Akhdar Groups of the Arabian platform is composed of four Permian (P1-P4) and four Triassic supersequences (Tr1-Tr4). Isolated platforms of the Hawasina and Batain basins comprise two Permian supersequences and one Triassic supersequence. In contrast to the continuous development of the Arabian shield, carbonate platform growth of the seamounts was restricted to the Guadalupian-Lopingian and to the Middle-Upper Triassic, and ceased after drowning events. Composite sequences exhibit a well-developed stacking pattern during the Guadalupian-Lopingian (Saiq Formation). Lowstand systems tracts (LSTs) occur during the Cisuralian (Gharif Formation, Haushi Group) and Triassic (Mahil Formation, Akhdar Group). Open-marine depositional environments prevail during transgressive systems tracts (TSTs) with diverse biota including rugose and scleractinian corals, chaetetids, bryozoans, and crinoids. Highstand system tracts (HSTs) exhibit a twofold pattern: During the transgressive phase of supersequences, composite sequence highstands are dominated by reef or level-bottom communities with corals. Cyclic platform deposits or monotonous mud- and wackestone accumulated during the turnaround or late second-order highstand of a supersequence. Correlation of maximum flooding surfaces with published data suggests that supersequences P1, P2, and Tr4 can be traced across the Arabian platform into the Neo-Tethys basins, while supersequences P3, P4, and Tr1-Tr3 resulted from local tectonic events at the margin of the Arabian platform (Hulw half-graben). The presented sea level curve corresponds therefore to the Tethyan sea level curve during the Cisuralian and Guadalupian, but differs significantly during the Lopingian, as a result of the dispersal of Pangea. The Middle and Upper Triassic sea level curve from Oman is again in good correlation with published data. The Permian and Triassic sequence architecture on the Arabian plate and adjacent Neo-Tethys was predominantly triggered by the global warming after the Permian-Carboniferous glaciation, the initial rifting of Neo-Tethys, and subordinately by eustatic sea level changes.

"Major restructuring of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, the Amazon rainforest and ENSO, are a source of concern for climate policy. We have elicited subjective probability intervals for the occurrence of such major changes under global warming from 43 scientists. Although the expert estimates highlight large uncertainty, they allocate significant probability to some of the events listed above. We deduce conservative lower bounds for the probability of triggering at least 1 of those events of 0.16 for medium (2-4 degrees C) and 0.56 for high global mean temperature change (above 4 degrees C) relative to year 2000 levels.",0
"We reconstructed a high-resolution, alkenone-based sea surface temperature (SST) record spanning the last ca. 150 years, from a sediment core retrieved within the main upwelling zone off Peru. A conspicuous SST decline is evidenced since the 1950s despite interdecadal SST variability. Instrumental SST data and reanalysis of ECMWF ERA 40 winds suggest that the recent coastal cooling corresponds mainly to an intensification of alongshore winds and associated increase of upwelling in spring. Consistently, both proxy and instrumental data evidence increased productivity in phase with the SST cooling. Our data expand on previous reports on recent SST cooling in other Eastern Boundary upwelling systems and support scenarios that relate coastal upwelling intensification to global warming. Yet, further investigations are needed to assess the role of different mechanisms and forcings (enhanced local winds vs. spin-up of the South Pacific High Pressure cell).

"While invasive plant species have dramatic and varied effects, this paper examines the focus of this symposium on their ""threat to native biodiversity and ecosystems"". This claim implies that there is (i) an enduring something, (ii) it is native, and (iii) it is under threat from invasive species. I examine these implications in turn, first considering the role of the observer in invasion biology, particularly in preferring a nature characterized by stability rather than flux. Second, I examine the concept of ""native"" given that humans are thoroughly embedded within ecological systems. Third, I demonstrate how our exclusion of humans conditions us to consider invasive species a primary threat rather than one among many interacting causal agents of global change; in particular, recent evidence indicates that these agents, which include human-caused disturbances and global warming (not to mention human population growth and global trade), may overwhelm the effects of invasive species per se. For these and other reasons, some ecologists have argued that ecological change is inevitable and that our concerns about invasive species are unjustified. I discuss these issues and suggest ways for ecologists to conduct engaged research through appropriate advocacy and engagement with stakeholders dealing with local invasive species.",0
"Genetic adaptation to temperature change can impact responses of populations and communities to global warming. Here we integrate previously published results on experimental evolution trials with follow-up experiments involving the water flea Daphnia as a model system. Our research shows (1) the capacity of natural populations of this species to genetically adapt to changes in temperature in a time span of months to years, (2) the context-dependence of these genetic changes, emphasizing the role of ecology and community composition on evolutionary responses to climatic change, and (3) the impact of micro-evolutionary changes on immigration success of preadapted genotypes. Our study involves (1) experimental evolution trials in the absence and presence of the community of competitors, predators, and parasites, (2) life-table and competition experiments to assess the fitness consequences of micro-evolution, and (3) competition experiments with putative immigrant genotypes. We use these observations as building blocks of an evolving metacommunity to understand biological responses to climatic change. This approach integrates both local and regional responses at both the population and community levels. Finally, we provide an outline of current gaps in knowledge and suggest fruitful avenues for future research.",0
"Six unsaturated fluorocarbon (UFC) gases as well as a fluorinated ether were examined for dielectric etch and global warming emissions performance and compared to three perfluorocompound (PFC) gases. All of the gases were capable of etch performance comparable to that of a typical C3F8 process, while exhibiting superior global warming emissions performance compared to the PFCs. A low-flow hexafluoro-2-butyne process was found to have a significant emissions benefit, showing a normalized emissions reduction of 88.2% compared to the C3F8 process. Two other C4F6 isomers (h)exafluoro-1,3-butadiene and hexafluorocyclobutene! also exhibited reductions greater than 80%, while hexafluoropropene and octafluorocyclopentene exhibited emissions reductions greater than 70% compared to the typical C3F8 process. For the C4F6 isomers, a large portion of the emissions were a result of CHF3 formation with photoresist as the sole source of the hydrogen. An extended 4 min etch with hexafluoro-1,3-butadiene resulted in a deep via with an aspect ratio of 5: 1, very high selectivity to photoresist, and no evidence of etch stopping.

"Economic trends have shaped our growth and the growth of the livestock sector, but at the expense of altering natural resources and systems in ways that are not always obvious. Now, however, the reverse is beginning to happen, i.e. environmental trends are beginning to shape our economy and health status. In addition to water, air and food, animals and birds play a pivotal role in the maintenance and transmission of important zoonotic diseases in nature. It is generally considered that the prevalence of vector-borne and waterborne zoonoses is likely to increase in the coming years due to the effects of global warming in India. In recent years, vector-borne diseases have emerged as a serious public health problem in countries of the South-East Asia region, including India. Vector-borne zoonoses now occur in epidemic form almost on an annual basis, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. New reservoir areas of cutaneous leishmaniosis in South India have been recognised, and the role of climate change in its re-emergence warrants further research, as does the role of climate change in the ascendancy of waterborne and foodborne illness. Similarly, climate change that leads to warmer and more humid conditions may increase the risk of transmission of airborne zoonoses, and hot and drier conditions may lead to a decline in the incidence of disease(s). The prevalence of these zoonotic diseases and their vectors and the effect of climate change on important zoonoses in India are discussed in this review.",0
"A floral change occurring in northern South America at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary is analysed using palynological data. The sequence studied is an outcrop from the Venezuelan Maracaibo basin, deposited in shallow marine to coastal environments without apparent stratigraphic breaks. Significant pollen and spore counts from 237 samples were studied stratigraphically and statistically in order to compare Paleocene and Eocene palaeofloras and palaeoecological trends. The Late Paleocene/Early Eocene transition is the boundary between two floras which differ both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, the change is not sudden but stepped and gradual. Paleocene taxa seem to be of pantropical distribution, whereas Eocene assemblages are more restricted to the Neotropics. The global warming well documented elsewhere is proposed as the major cause for these changes. Trends in sporomorph diversity in this record appear to track changes in temperature documented in isotopic records from temperate regions. The extinct parent plant of Echitriporites trianguliformis is tentatively proposed to be intolerant to high temperatures, because of its absence during the Early Eocene warm phase. Palaeoecologically, although marsh and back-mangrove swamps dominated both Late Paleocene and Early Eocene assemblages, their taxonomic compositions were different, especially in the inland marsh forests. Mangrove components are scarce or absent through the whole sequence studied, suggesting the absence of these communities during the time-interval analysed. A palaeoecological subdivision into assemblage zones was not possible; instead, a recurrent pattern suggesting palynological cycles was observed. However, palynocycles could not be studied in detail due to the lack of knowledge of botanical affinities for many of the taxa involved and the apparent absence of mangrove assemblages.

"Based upon the 1970 aero-photo topographic map, and TM/ETM satellite images taken in 1991 and 2000, the authors artificially interpreted boundaries of lake and glaciers in Nam Co Catchment, and quantified lake-glacier area variations in different stages by ""integrated method"" with the support of GIS. Results show that from 1970 to 2000, lake area increased from 1942.34 km(2) to 1979.79 km(2) at a rate of 27 km(2)/a, while glacier area decreased from 167.62 km(2) to 1488 km(2) at a rate of 0.86 km(2)/a. The increasing rate of lake in 1991-2000 was 76 km(2)/a that was faster than 03 km(2)/a in 1970-1991, while in the same period of time, the shrinking rates of glaciers were 0.97 km(2)/a and 0.80 km(2)/a respectively. Important factors, relevant to lake and glacier response to the climate, such as air temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and their values in warm and cold seasons, were discussed. The result suggests that temperature increasing is the main reason for the accelerated melting of glaciers. Lake expansion is mainly induced by the increase of the glacier melting water, increase of precipitation and obvious decrease of potential evapotranspiration. Precipitation, evaporation and their linkages with lake enlargement on regional scale need to be thoroughly studied under the background of global warming and glacier retreating.",0
"Given the high cost of crude oil, uncertainties regarding future reserves as well as the phenomenon of global warming, alternative fuels such as bioethanol need to be developed and deployed. This work presents an economic analysis (operating cost analysis) of one annexed African distillery operating in a landlocked and rural location. Specifically, the study attempts to analyze the impacts that some of the critical factors influencing bioethanol production will have on its viability and also present an analysis of the breakdown of the operating costs of the distillery, in an equation format to enable easier and more rapid use of the data in numerical and economic models, and in the preliminary design and optimization of bioethanol plants. The cost of ethanol production was estimated at $19.57/HL with cost of feedstock (molasses ""type C"") constituting about one third of the production cost. The study also identified other major, intermediate, and minor input factors, which can provide insights to both the possible barriers to implementation that should be overcome, and on the technological improvement options that should be stimulated by research and development in ethanol industry. Finally, from the operating cost analysis of the annexed distillery, it emerged that the factorial approach to estimation is principally a sound one, with no indication of untypical cost items. Some of the typical cost items do however display ratios to the base cost that are outside of previously reported limits.

"The factors governing the rate of change in the amount of atmospheric water vapor are analyzed in simulations of climate change. The global-mean amount of water vapor is estimated to increase at a differential rate of 7.3% K-1 with respect to global-mean surface air temperature in the multi-model mean. Larger rates of change result if the fractional change is evaluated over a finite change in temperature (e.g., 8.2% K-1 for a 3 K warming), and rates of change of zonal-mean column water vapor range from 6 to 12% K-1 depending on latitude. Clausius-Clapeyron scaling is directly evaluated using an invariant distribution of monthly-mean relative humidity, giving a rate of 7.4% K-1 for global-mean water vapor. There are deviations from Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of zonal-mean column water vapor in the tropics and mid-latitudes, but they largely cancel in the global mean. A purely thermodynamic scaling based on a saturated troposphere gives a higher global rate of 7.9% K- Surface specific humidity increases at a rate of 5.7% K-1, considerably lower than the rate for global-mean water vapor. Surface specific humidity closely follows Clausius-Clapeyron scaling over ocean. But there are widespread decreases in surface relative humidity over land (by more than 1% K-1 in many regions), and it is argued that decreases of this magnitude could result from the land/ocean contrast in surface warming.",0
"Field-grown perennial ryegrass was subjected to climate warming and elevated CO2 concentration during summer in free air conditions (no enclosure of the vegetation). Increased foliage temperature (2.5 degrees C above fluctuating ambient) was induced by heating the stand with infrared radiation sources, modulated by an electronic control device (FATI, Free Air Temperature Increase). Enhanced CO2 was produced by a FACE system (Free Air CO2 Enrichment). Exposure to simulated climate warming drastically reduced above-ground harvestable dry matter (52% loss). The nitrogen allocated to the leaf fraction was thus concentrated into less dry matter, which enhanced the nitrogen concentration on a mass basis (+17%) but also per unit leaf area (+47%). As a consequence, CO, assimilation rates were not affected in these slower growing plants in the +2.5 degrees C treatment, and the photochemical efficiency of non-cyclic electron transport of photosystem II was also unaffected. Although the plants were grown in the field without root restrictions, long-term exposure to elevated CO, concentration induced noticeable acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus (40% loss of fixation potential), which largely outweighed the direct stimulation in this summer period. Part of the reduced rates could be attributed to lower N concentration on a leaf area basis. The results are compared with responses of this species in sunlit conditioned greenhouses, which indicates that experiments in enclosures may underestimate effects in the field. This also emphasizes the need to validate other plant responses to climate warming and CO2 enrichment in free air conditions.",0
"Fungal and bacterial denitrification rates were determined under a range of redox conditions in sediment from a Louisiana swamp forest used for wastewater treatment. Sediment was incubated in microcosms at 6 Eh levels (-200, -100, 0, +100, +250 and +400 mV) ranging from strongly reducing to moderately oxidizing conditions. Denitrification was determined using the substrate-induced respiration (SIR) inhibition and acetylene inhibition methods. Cycloheximide (C(15)H(23)NO(4)) was used as the fungal inhibitor and streptomycin (C(21)F(139)N(7)O(12)) as the bacterial inhibitor. At Eh values of +250 my and +400 mV, denitrification rates by fungi and bacteria were 34.3-35.1% and 46-59% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that fungi were responsible for most of the denitrification under aerobic or weakly reducing conditions. On the other hand, at Eh -200 mV, denitrification rates of fungi and bacteria were 17.6% and 64.9% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that bacteria were responsible for most of the denitrification under strongly reducing conditions. Results show fungal denitrification was dominant under moderately reducing to weakly oxidizing conditions (Eh > +250 mV), whereas bacterial denitrification was dominant under strongly reducing condition (Eh < -100 mV). At Eh values between -100 to +100 mV, denitrification by fungi and bacteria were 37.9-43.2% and 53.0-51% of total denitrification, respectively, indicating that both bacteria and fungi contributed significantly to denitrification under these redox conditions. Because N(2)O is an important gaseous denitrification product in sediment, fungal denitrification could be of greater ecological significance under aerobic or moderately reducing conditions contributing to greenhouse gas emission and global warming potential (GWP).

"It has been speculated that future global warming will change the frequency and severity of tropical and extratropical storms. The U.S. east coast is heavily impacted by such storms, so it is important to determine their natural temporal variability for the last century during which global warming has been relatively small. Storm surge data obtained from hourly tide gauge records provide a unique quantitative measure of storm duration and intensity, unlike qualitative estimates based on eyewitness reports or meteorological hindcasts. To demonstrate the potential of storm surge data for climate analysis, the authors have evaluated 10 very long records of water level anomalies. An analysis of the hourly tide gauge records along the U.S, east coast shows a considerable interdecadal variation but no discernible long-term trend in the number and intensity of moderate and severe coastal storms during this century. However, sea level rise over the last century has exacerbated the damage to fixed structures from modern storms that would have been relatively minor a century ago.",0
"The development of improved technology for agricultural production and its diffusion to farmers is a process requiring investment and time. A large number of studies of this process have been undertaken. The findings of these studies have been incorporated into a quantitative policy model projecting supplies of commodities (in terms of area and crop yields), equilibrium prices, and international trade volumes to the year 2020, These projections show that a ""global food crisis,"" as would be manifested in high commodity prices, is unlikely to occur. The same projections show, however, that in many countries,""local food crisis,"" as manifested in low agricultural incomes and associated low food consumption in the presence of low food prices, will occur. Simulations show that delays in the diffusion of modern biotechnology research capabilities to developing countries will exacerbate local food crises. Similarly, global climate change will also exacerbate these crises, accentuating the importance of bringing strengthened research capabilities to developing countries.",0
"The aim of this study is to determine the input output energy consumption and to make a cost analysis of intermediate type stake-tomato grown in open field in Tokat province of Turkey. The data used in the study were obtained from 98 local tomato growers using a questionnaire. The farms were chosen by random sampling method. The results showed that the amount of energy consumed in stake-tomato production was 96 957.36 MJ ha(-1). About 42% of this was generated by diesel oil and 38% from fertilizers and machinery. The input-output ratio was 0.80 and energy productivity was found to be 00kg MJ ha(-1). About 76% of the total energy inputs used in stake-tomato production was non-renewable while only about 22% was renewable. These findings reveal that intensive input use in stake-tomato production, especially chemical fertilizers, gives a high tomato yield but also raises some problems like environmental pollution and global warming. Thus, new policies, emphasizing energy consumption without degradation of national resources, should be designed for such farms. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"A large increase in Betula during a narrow 1000 year window, similar to 13,800 years before present (YBP) in Alaska and Yukon corresponded in time with the extinction of mammoths and the arrival of humans. Pollen data indicate the increase in Betula during this time was widespread across Siberia and Beringia. We hypothesize that Betula increased due to a combination of a warming climate and reduced herbivory following the extinction of the Pleistocene mega herbivores. The rapid increase in Betula modified land surface albedo which climate-model simulations indicate would cause an average net warming of similar to 0.021 degrees C per percent increase in high latitude (53-73 degrees N) Betula cover. We hypothesize that the extinction of mammoths increased Betula cover, which would have warmed Siberia and Beringia by on average 0.2 degrees C, but regionally by up to 1 degrees C. If humans were partially responsible for the extinction of the mammoths, then human influences on global climate predate the origin of agriculture. Citation: Doughty, C. E., A. Wolf, and C. B.

"On the basis of tailoring of amorphous alloy electrodes for seawater electrolysis to form H-2 and amorphous alloy catalysts for conversion of CO2 to CH4, we are proposing global CO2 recycling: At deserts; power generation by solar energy, at coasts close to the deserts; production of H-2 by electrolysis of seawater, production of CH4 by the reaction of H-2 and CO2 transported, and at energy consuming districts; combustion of CH4, recovery of CO2 and transportation of liquefied CO2 to the coast close to the deserts. Since Egyptian scientists agree with us to do collaboration, the energy balance and the amount of reduction of CO2 emission in the global CO2 recycling between Middle East and Japan are estimated for the operation of a 1 GW CH4-combustion power plant. The energy consumed in a year up to liquefaction of CH4 including that corresponding to the repayment of solar power plant is almost the same as that spent up to obtaining LNG. The energy necessary for the global CO2 recycling is only 8.7% higher than the energy necessary for LNG combustion for power generation without control of CO2 emission. The extra energy is for recovery, liquefaction and transportation of CO2. The reduction of CO2 emission by the global CO2 recycling is 79% of CO2 emission from an LNG combustion power plant, that is, 2.62 Mtons/year.",0
"This study applies a simple framework for analysing the incidence of record events. A test of this method on the global mean temperature yields results consistent with a global warming, where record-warm events are more frequent than for a stationary series. The record event analysis suggests that the number of record-warm monthly global mean temperatures is higher than expected, and that the number of record events in the absolute monthly maximum and minimum temperatures in the Nordic countries is slightly higher than expected from a null hypothesis of a stationary behaviour. Because the different station series are not strictly independent, it is difficult to resolve whether there is a significant trend in the warmest absolute monthly minimum temperatures in the Nordic countries. The behaviour of the maximum monthly 24 h precipitation is not distinguishable from the null hypothesis that the series consists of independent and identically distributed random variables.",0
"The total number of threatened species of vertebrates is likely to be more than 10,000, with approximately one quarter of the world's mammal species, one eighth of the birds and one third of the amphibians threatened with extinction. The rate of loss of animal species and hence of biodiversity is increasing and may become even greater as ecosystems become affected by climate change due to global warming. Behavioral neuroendocrinology, which considers interactions between behavior and neuroendocrine function in animals from all vertebrate taxa, can contribute to animal conservation. Research with laboratory animals can address questions in basic biology relevant to conservation and develop methods for use with threatened animals. Field work with free-living animals considers the basic biology of new species and the use of endocrine tools to assess the susceptibility of species to threats. Non-invasive measurements of hormone concentrations, especially fecal steroids, are extensively used to assess reproductive function and the stress status of animals in captive breeding programs and in the wild. Biodiversity and natural selection both depend on individual variation, and conservation programs often work with animals on an individual basis. The consideration of data from individuals is essential in conservation endocrinology. Direct contributions to conservation programs are challenging as study situations are determined by practical conservation concerns. Indirect contributions such as the provision of scientific input to conservation plans and participation in public education programs offer significant benefits for conservation programs. Directly and indirectly, there are many opportunities for behavioral neuroendocrinologists to contribute to conservation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Climate change is predicted to shorten the fire interval in boreal forests. Many studies have recorded positive effects of fire on forest growth over a few decades, but few have modeled the long-term effects of the loss of carbon and nitrogen to the atmosphere. We used a process-based, dynamic, forest ecosystem model, which couples the carbon, nitrogen and water cycles, to simulate the effects of fire frequency on coniferous forests in the climate of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. The model was calibrated to simulate observed forest properties. The model predicted rapid short-term recovery of net primary productivity (NPP) after fire, but in the long term, supported the hypotheses that (1) current NPP and carbon content of boreal forests are lower than they would be without periodic fire, and (2) any increase in fire frequency in the future will tend to lower NPP and carbon storage. Lower long-term NPP and carbon storage were attributable to (1) loss of carbon on combustion, equal to about 20% of NPP over a 100-200 year fire cycle, (2) loss of nitrogen by volatilization in fire, equal to about 3-4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) over a 100-200 year fire cycle, and (3) the fact that the normal fire cycle is much shorter than the time taken for the forest (especially the soil) to reach an equilibrium carbon and nitrogen content. It was estimated that a shift in fire frequency from 200 to 100 years over 1000 Mha of boreal forest would release an average of about 0.1 Gt C year(-1) over many centuries.",0
"Agriculture plays a major role in the global fluxes of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. From 1991 to 1999, we measured gas fluxes and other sources of global warming potential (GWP) in cropped and nearby unmanaged ecosystems. Net GWP (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per square meter per year) ranged from 110 in our conventional tillage systems to -211 in early successional communities. None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP. In all but one ecosystem, nitrous oxide production was the single greatest source of GWP. In the Late successional system, GWP was neutral because of significant methane oxidation. These results suggest additional opportunities for Lessening the GWP of agronomic systems.",0
"A practical approach is recommended for identifying and archiving tornado events, based on the use of definitions that label all vortices as either type I, II, or III tornadoes. This methodology will provide a more meaningful tornado climatology in Storm Data, which separates and classifies all vortices associated in any manner with cumuliform clouds. Tornadoes produced within the mesocyclone of discrete supercell storms, with strong local updrafts (SLUs), will be classified as type I tornadoes. Frequently, these type I tornadoes result from the interaction of the SLU with strong rear-flank downdrafts (RFDs), or with shear vortices in the PBL. Tornadoes produced in association with quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS) will be classified as type II tornadoes (including cold pool, rear-inflow jets, bookend, and mesovortex events along the line). All other vortex types (including landspouts, waterspouts, gustnadoes, cold air vortices, and tornadoes not associated with mesocyclones or QLCS) will be labeled as type III tornadoes. A general discussion is provided that further clarifies the differences and categorization of these three classifications (which encompass 15 tornado species), along with a recommendation that NOAA adopt this taxonomy in operational and data archiving practices. Radar analysis and field observations, combined with storm-scale meteorological expertise, should allow for the official ""typing'' of tornado reports by NOAA personnel. Establishment of such a climatological database in Storm Data may be of value in assessing the effects (if any) of twenty-first-century global warming on U.S. tornado trends.",0
"Management of the organic fraction of urban solid waste using anaerobic procedures will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and using biogas, which is a carbon neutral energy, to generate electrical energy will eventually help in reducing the combustion of fossil fuel. Energy recovery in the form of biogas from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated in three different locations is studied. The present status of the biomethanation plants at these locations is reviewed and analysed, in order to understand the prospects of biomethanation as a technological option for managing the increasing urban solid waste sustainability. In spite of the fact that biomethanation is an established technology worldwide, including India, the scale-up of the same has become an uphill task, both for the Central Government and the Urban Local Bodies. Biomethanation for processing the organic fraction of urban solid wastes needs a lot of planning, not only with respect to the design, construction and operation, but also with institutionalising the concept of integrated solid waste management, without which biomethanation would not be a viable option.",0
"The nutrient (TP, N-NO3, TKN - Kjeldhal nitrogen) loading to lakes (from river, precipitation, direct catchment) and in-lake retention were calculated for five successive lakes of the river-lake system typical of the mosaic, hilly lake-land region (the Jorka system, Masurian Lakeland). The annual values of loading for TP and TN were mostly not higher than 0 and 15.0 g m(-2) lake area, respectively and rather low compared to other river-lake systems in the lakeland region. However, these values as well as nutrient in-lake retention decreased in 1997-1998 (warm and dry years) compared with 1978 and 1996, together with the decrease in discharge and exchange rate of lake water. In selected cases the retention of TP and TKN became negative which means that the lake functioned as the source of nutrients for downstream fragments of the system. The retention of nitrate-nitrogen was usually positive - lakes remained effective sites for its removal (denitrification). The possible changes in functioning of small catchments and chains of shallow, eutrophic lakes under the conditions of global warming are discussed.",0
"Sugarcane is currently the main renewable energy source in Brazil. Due to the importance of the cane industry and its contribution to a wide range of biobased energy and other products, LCA studies regarding cane-derived products are needed to assess their environmental benefits. The main objective of this work was the assessment of life cycle energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to cane sugar and ethanol, considering bagasse and electricity surpluses as coproducts. We performed an overall balance for the Brazilian Center-South Region, adopting different methods to evaluate sugar and ethanol production separately. The GREET 8c.0 model was used for the 'well-to-wheels' calculations but adapted to the comprehensive set of Brazilian parameters that best represent the Center-South Region. For the reference case, fossil energy use and GHG emissions related to sugar production were evaluated as 721 kJ/kg and 234 g CO(2)eq/kg, respectively. For the ethanol life cycle, these values were 80 kJ/MJ and 23 g CO(2)eq/MJ. Special attention was paid to the variation of some parameters among producing units based on data collected by industry. The consequent uncertainties in ethanol life cycle emissions were assessed through a Monte Carlo analysis based on assigned distribution of probability curves for eleven selected parameters and informed by partial statistical data available from industry for distribution generation. Projections were also made for 2020 scenario parameters based on the best in current class technologies and technological improvements deemed commercially possible today.

"A semi-empirical downscaling approach is presented to estimate spatial and temporal statistical properties of local daily mean wind speed under global climate change. The present semi-empirical downscaling method consists of two elements. Since general circulation models (GCMs) are able to reproduce the features of the present atmospheric general circulation quite correctly, the first element represents the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. The second element is a link between local wind speed and large-scale circulation pattern (CP). The linkage is expressed by a stochastic model conditioned on CP types. Parameters of the linkage model are estimated using observed data series; then this model is utilized with GCM-generated CP type data corresponding to a 2 x CO2 scenario. Under the climate of Nebraska the lognormal distribution is the best two-parameter distribution to describe daily mean wind speed. The space-time variability of wind speed is described by a transformed multivariate autoregressive (AR) process, and the linkage between local wind and large-scale circulation is expressed as a conditional AR process, i.e. the autoregressive parameters depend on the actual daily CP type. The basic tendency of change under 2 x CO2 climate is a considerable increase of wind speed from the beginning of summer to the end of winter and a somewhat smaller wind decrease in spring.

"More than 2.4 billion people around the world in the rural community depend on biomass fuel (wood, charcoal animal dung, and crop residue). Incomplete combustion of this fuel has led to increased amounts of indoor pollution and raise in global warming; this has further led to the increase in the incidence of diseases. Therefore, interventions to reduce biomass fuel related emission by alternative fuels and improved combustion efficiency can improve health, add to socioeconomic development. The area selected for sampling was the Uchalli Wetlands Complex which in the Northwest of Khushab district in Pakistan which houses three saline lakes surrounded by forest and villages. A questionnaire was designed with questions regarding the household fuel use and techniques to improve livelihood and to create awareness and locals from the age of 19-95 were interviewed with a majority of males, houses in the area were mainly of stone blocks and majority males in the area worked in the city. Combined family system was prevalent in the area (80%) with about 42% of the population having no formal education. A wide variety of stoves were observed in the area with wives having a major decision (69%) in fuel choice which mainly depended on the cheapness and availability of the fuel. The cooking being mostly done (79.8%) outside in summers and indoors in winters. Majority of the respondents (94.7%) were aware that liquid petroleum gas and natural gas are better ways of reducing pollution and decreasing the incidence of diseases which included using dry wood, proper ventilation and many others.",0
"Given that fire is the most important disturbance of the boreal forest, climatically induced changes in fire frequency (i.e., area burnt per year) can have important consequences on the resulting forest mosaic age-class distribution and composition. Using archives and dendroecological data we reconstructed the fire frequency in four large sectors along a transect from eastern Ontario to central Quebec. Results showed a dramatic decrease in fire frequency that began in the mid-19th century and has been accentuated during the 20th century. Although all areas showed a similar temporal decrease in area burned, we observed a gradual increase in fire frequency from the west to Abitibi east, followed by a slight decrease in central Quebec. The global warming that has been occurring since the end of the Little Ice Age (similar to 1850) may have created a climate less prone to large forest fires in the eastern boreal forest of North America. This interpretation is corroborated by predictions of a decrease in forest fires for that region of the boreal forest in the future. A longer fire cycle (i.e., the time needed to burn an area equivalent to the study area) has important consequences for sustainable forest management of the boreal forest of eastern Canada. When considering the important proportion of overmature and old-growth stands in the landscape resulting from the elongation of the fire cycles, it becomes difficult to justify clear-cutting practices over all the entire area as well as short rotations as a means to emulate natural disturbances. Alternative practices involving the uses of variable proportion of clear, partial, and selective cutting are discussed.",0
"Mediated by algal symbionts, calcification in reef building corals is one of the important processes, which enable coral's growth. In the present study, we used a buoyant weighing technique to study calcification of two coralline species. Stylophora pistillata and the hydrocoral Millepora dichotoma. The colonies were grown in a tank system, in which light, nutrition and water motion were kept constant and temperature was elevated by means of a computerized controlled apparatus. An almost constant rate of calcification was observed in the two species at 22-28 degreesC. Elevation of the temperature above this range to 29-31 degreesC caused a slow down in calcification in both species. A grater number of S. pistillata colonies became bleached at temperatures of greater than or equal to 29 degreesC, whereas M. dichotoma colonies suffered from bleaching only after three days at 31 degreesC. For both species, control groups. remained viable during the experimental period. The differences in responses to changes in temperature of the two species may be as a consequence of different adaptive mechanisms or to different susceptibilities of the corals to elevated temperatures, We have shown that elevating temperatures above annual maximal ranges have a significant effect on coral calcification. We also demonstrated that sessile calcified marine organisms having ecological and biomedical significance could be cultured and manipulated under laboratory conditions.

"To establish energetically and environmentally viable paddy rice-based bioethanol production systems in northern Japan, it is important to implement appropriately selected agronomic practice options during the rice cultivation step. In this context, effects of rice variety (conventional vs. high-yielding) and rice straw management (return to vs. removal from the paddy field) on energy inputs from fuels and consumption of materials, greenhouse gas emissions (fuel and material consumption-derived CO2 emissions as well as paddy soil CH4 and N2O emissions) and ethanol yields were assessed. The estimated ethanol yield from the high-yielding rice variety, ""Kita-aoba"" was 2.94 kL ha(-1), a 32% increase from the conventional rice variety, ""Kirara 397"". Under conventional rice production in northern Japan (conventional rice variety and straw returned to the paddy), raising seedlings, mechanical field operations, transportation of harvested unhulled brown rice and consumption of materials (seeds, fertilizers, biocides and agricultural machinery) amounted to 28.5 GJ ha(-1) in energy inputs. The total energy input was increased by 14% by using the high-yielding variety and straw removal, owing to increased requirements for fuels in harvesting and transporting harvested rice as well as in collecting, loading and transporting rice straw. In terms of energy efficiency, the variation among rice variety and straw management scenarios regarding rice varieties and rice straw management was small (28.5-32.6 GJ ha(-1) or 10.1-14.0 MJ L-1). Meanwhile, CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions varied considerably from scenario to scenario, as straw management had significant impacts on CH4 emissions from paddy soils. When rice straw was incorporated into the soil, total CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions for ""Kirara 397"" and ""Kita-aoba"" were 25.5 and 28.2 Mg CO2 ha(-1), respectively; however, these emissions were reduced notably for the two varieties when rice straw was removed from the paddy fields in an effort to mitigate CH4 emissions. Thus, rice straw removal avers itself a key practice with respect to lessening the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in paddy rice-based ethanol production systems in northern Japan. More crucially, the rice straw removed is available for ethanol production and generation of heat energy with a biomass boiler, all elements required for biomass-to-ethanol transformation steps including saccharification, fermentation and distillation. This indicates opportunities for further improvement in energy efficiency and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions under whole rice plant-based bioethanol production systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"AMS(14)C dating and analysis of grain size, major elements and clay minerals were applied to Core MZ01 from the mud area on the inner shelf of the East China Sea. Based on the environmentally sensitive grain size, clay mineral and major element assemblages, the history of the East Asia winter monsoon since the mid-Holocene could be reconstructed. These three proxies, mean grain size (>9.71 mu m), chemical index of alteration (CIA) and ratio of smectite to kaolinite in particular, show similar fluctuation patterns. Furthermore, 10 extreme values corresponding to the contemporary cooling events could be recognized since the mid-Holocene; these extreme values are likely to have been caused by the strengthening of the East Asia winter monsoon. The cooling events correlated well with the results of the delta(18)O curves of the Dunde ice core and GISP2, which therefore revealed a regional response to global climate change. Four stages of the East Asia winter monsoon were identified, i.e. 8300-6300 a BP, strong and unstable; 6300-3800 a BP, strong but stable; 3800-1400 a BP, weak and unstable; after 1400 a BP, weak but stable.",0
"Background: Tropical trees undergo severe stress through seasonal drought and flooding, and the ability of these species to respond may be a major factor in their survival in tropical ecosystems, particularly in relation to global climate change. Aquaporins are involved in the regulation of water flow and have been shown to be involved in drought response; they may therefore play a major adaptive role in these species. We describe genetic diversity in the PIP sub-family of the widespread gene family of Aquaporins in five Neotropical tree species covering four botanical families. Results: PIP Aquaporin subfamily genes were isolated, and their DNA sequence polymorphisms characterised in natural populations. Sequence data were analysed with statistical tests of standard neutral equilibrium and demographic scenarios simulated to compare with the observed results. Chloroplast SSRs were also used to test demographic transitions. Most gene fragments are highly polymorphic and display signatures of balancing selection or bottlenecks; chloroplast SSR markers have significant statistics that do not conform to expectations for population bottlenecks. Although not incompatible with a purely demographic scenario, the combination of all tests tends to favour a selective interpretation of extant gene diversity. Conclusions: Tropical tree PIP genes may generally undergo balancing selection, which may maintain high levels of genetic diversity at these loci. Genetic variation at PIP genes may represent a response to variable environmental conditions.",0
"Fossil fuels present the difficult-to-reconcile dilemma that the energy systems of today's society dictate that we use great quantities of fossil fuels to produce the energy we need, but their use results in the liberation of large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the so-called ''greenhouse gases''. Certain models predict that uncontrolled releases of greenhouse gases could result in unacceptable increases in global mean temperature. This dilemma is examined and a method of management of the use of fossil fuels is presented that will help to mitigate the problems their use creates. The challenge is to avoid the dilemma by technology and policy intervention so that fossil fuels are used to the net benefit of society and its environment. We should take those low-cost measures that slow greenhouse gas emissions, and we should be prepared technologically to accomplish much larger reductions if necessary. At present, our technological insurance is not in place, but the opportunities for improvement are great, even for fossil fuels. Several low-cost actions that can be taken in the near term include the establishment of policies including R&D that encourage the development of more efficient and economical end-use and conversion technologies (e.g., more efficient gas turbines, fuel cells, oxygen-blown gasifiers, and processes for producing hydrogen from fossil sources); more intensive R&D to accelerate the development of better nonfossil sources including direct solar, biomass, and other renewables, fission, and fusion; policies that encourage the substitution of hydrogen-rich for hydrogen-lean fuels and expansion of the natural gas system, particularly in developing nations; cooperation by western industrialized countries in providing technical assistance to developing and Eastern European countries for producing energy technologies that are both economically and environmentally more attractive, including expanding the development and use of the natural gas resources of the former Soviet Union; R&D to increase our understanding of the global cycle of CO2 releases to the atmosphere and its removal by the oceans and by terrestrial ecosystems so that climate stabilization targets and policies can be better established; and experiments with CO2 recovery and sequestration techniques so that the economic and environmental impacts are better understood.",0
"The tea leaf roller, Caloptilia theivora Walsingham (Lepidoptera: Gracillariinae), is one of the serious pests of tea plants in Japan. To understand the mechanism of seasonal occurrence of this insect pest, we developed a population dynamics model that explicitly incorporates the temperature-dependent development of the pest. The model predictions were compared with observed captures in pheromone traps at the experimental site of the Kagoshima Tea Experiment Research Station in Japan. The results showed that the emergence timing of the insect pest observed in the field was determined primarily by temperature. The relationship between the timing of adult emergence and the leaf damage level was also studied using a logistic regression model. The infestation level decreased as the interval between the adult peak emergence date and the date of tea plucking increased, implying that asynchrony between plant phenology and emergence of the insect pest is a critical factor reducing damage level. We examined how the damage level changes according to global warming. Increased temperature made the timing of insect appearance forward and enhance asynchrony of plant-pest phenology. Therefore, reduction of damage level by the insect pest is expected under global warming.",0
"Agricultural production is vulnerable to variability in weather conditions. Thus, projections of global climate change have prompted many studies on its possible impacts on agriculture. The aim of [is research was to develop a system to facilitate studies of the effects of climate change on crop production in the southeastern USA. The Agricultural and Environmental Geographic Information System (AEGIS V2.5) was developed by integrating field crop models for corn soybean, rice, wheat, peanut, and dry beans used in previous national and international studies on climate change with a Geographic Information System (GIS) on a personal computer. These crop models include the effects of CO2 on growth and yield and on crop water use. Soil and weather data are linked to map units so that model inputs as well as simulated results can be displayed over two dimensional space. The system allows users to alter management practices such as planting date, irrigation and cultivars, to study the possibilities of mitigating harmfill effects by adapting new practices. Example results for Florida show that non-irrigated crop yields will likely decrease and that irrigation demand would increase considerably under climate change scenarios. Examples results for Florida are displayed on a map to demonstrate the system.",0
"Noctilucent clouds (NLCs) and polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSEs) are two phenomena at the forefront of near earth space science. NLCs are high altitude clouds in the earth's mesosphere that are formed from aerosol particles. The increase in the occurence of NLCs over time is believed to have profound implications on global climate change. PMSEs are believed to be related to NLCs and are strong radar echoes from mesospheric turbulence in the 50 MHz to 3 GHz range. Currently, there is no universally accepted explanation for the irregularities thought to produce PMSEs. Recent simultaneous sounding rocket, radar, and lidar observations of NLCs and PMSEs have provided a more detailed description of the electrodynamics and plasma configuration inside NLCs and the relationship to PMSEs. Particularly important is the simultaneous observation of charged aerosols, electron depletions, and small-scale electric field irregularities in the PMSE generation region. This work considers the consequences of the recent experimental observations on ultimately understanding the generation mechanism for PMSEs and the relationship to NLCs. A model for the electrodynamics and plasma configuration in the charged aerosol boundary layer will be described that indicates that plasma flows are expected to exist in the equilibrium. The possible role of these plasma flows in producing electron turbulence and irregularities in the charged aerosol boundary layer that may ultimately result in PMSEs is discussed. (C) 2004 COSPAR.

"Plant physiologists have traditionally studied the relationship between crop performance (the phenotype) and the environment. Global change processes present multiple challenges to crop performance that can be met effectively by changing the crop environment through management, and by modifying the crop genome (the genotype) through plant breeding and molecular biology. In order to increase the reliability of crop performance prediction based upon genetic information, new tools are needed to more effectively relate observed phenotypes to genotypes. The emerging discipline of genomics offers promise of providing such tools, and may provide a unique opportunity to enhance genetic gains and stabilize global crop production. Genomics has developed from the confluence of genetics, automated laboratory tools for generating DNA- and RNA-based data, and methods of information management. Functional genomics concentrates on how genes function, alone and in networks, while structural genomics focuses on physical and structural aspects of the genome. The traditional strengths of physiology lie in interpreting whole plant response to environmental signals, dissecting traits into component processes, and predicting correlated responses when genes and pathways are perturbed. These complement information on the genetic control of signal transduction, gene expression, gene networks and candidate genes. Combining physiological and genetic information can provide a more complete model of gene-to-phenotype relationships and genotype-by-environment interactions. Phenotypic screening procedures that more accurately identify underlying genetic variation, and crop models that incorporate Mendelian genetic controls of key processes provide two tangible examples of fruitful collaboration between physiologists and geneticists. These point to a productive complementary relationship between disciplines that will speed progress towards stable and adequate food production, despite challenges posed by global climate change.

"Global warming leads to the melting of ice caps and glaciers and, consequently, the exposure of new areas of land to the atmosphere and weathering. These areas usually have a high reactivity to both biotic and abiotic changes. Proglacial areas in the Alps usually have a deglaciation time span of around 150 years (time since the end of the ""Little Ice Age"" in the 1850's). We investigated a chronosequence of very young soils in the proglacial area Morteratsch (Swiss Alps) to derive time-trends of soil organic matter accumulation and evolution. Total organic C and N contents, C and N contents of the various organic matter (OM) density fractions and of the labile (oxidised by H(2)O(2)) and stable (H(2)O(2)-resistant) fractions were measured. Further characterisation of OM and the various fractions was performed using Diffuse Reflection Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT). Soil organic matter has been accumulated over 150 years at very high rates, values lay between 7 and 368 C/m(2)/year. This led to a soil organic matter abundance of about 1-5.5 kg C/m(2) after 140 years. Even at the start of soil formation, a very stable fraction of soil organic matter was detectable. Stable organic matter (resistant to the H(2)O(2) treatment) comprised about 6% of the total soil organic carbon and 10% of the total nitrogen. At the start of soil formation, a very high proportion of soil organic matter was present in the density fractions <6 g/cm(3). After about 140 years, 15% of soil organic carbon and 35-40% of the nitrogen was already present in the highest density fraction (>2 g/cm(3)). With time, the quality of soil organic matter changed: a decrease of hydrophobicity, an increase in aromatic compounds in the bulk soil and a decrease in phenolic functional groups in the heaviest density fraction were detectable with increasing age. In general, stable organic matter as well as the density fraction >2 g/cm(3) had a low C/N ratio and were enriched in proteinaceous materials. The adsorption of proteinaceous materials points to a strong organomineral association. This process has existed since the very beginning of soil formation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Empirical studies often reveal deleterious effects of parasites on host survival, but the ecological and environmental processes modulating parasite-associated host mortality are not well understood. We conducted meta-analysis of experimental studies assessing parasite-associated mortality (n = 52) to evaluate broad-scale patterns in host mortality risk relative to host or parasite taxon, parasite life cycle, or local environmental conditions. Overall, likelihood of host mortality was similar to 2.6 times higher among infected individuals when compared with hosts that either lacked parasites or had experimentally-reduced parasite burdens. Parasites with complex life cycles reliant on predation-mediated transmission generally were associated with higher mortality risk than those exploiting other transmission strategies. We also detected a negative relationship between parasite-associated host mortality and latitude; host mortality risk declined by similar to 2.6% with each degree increase in latitude. This result indicated the likely importance of abiotic factors in determining parasite effects. Host taxonomy further influenced parasite-associated mortality risk, with amphibian, fish, and mollusc hosts generally having higher hazard than arthropod, mammal, and bird hosts. Our results suggest patterns that conform to the predicted link between host mortality and parasite transmissibility, and pathogenicity. The relationship between host mortality and latitude in particular may portend marked shifts in host-parasite relationships pursuant to ongoing and projected global climate change.",0
"Univariate time-series analyses were conducted on stable carbon isotope ratios obtained from tree-ring cellulose. We looked for the presence and structure of autocorrelation. Significant autocorrelation violates the statistical independence assumption and biases hypothesis tests. Its presence would indicate the existence of lagged physiological effects that persist for longer than the current year. We analyzed data from 28 trees (60-85 years old; mean = 73 years) of western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl.), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca) growing in northern Idaho. Material was obtained by the stem analysis method from rings laid down in the upper portion of the crown throughout each tree's life. The sampling protocol minimized variation caused by changing light regimes within each tree. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models were used to describe the autocorrelation structure over time. Three time series were analyzed for each tree: the stable carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13); discrimination (Delta); and the difference between ambient and internal CO2 concentrations (c(a) - c(i)). The effect of converting from ring cellulose to whole-leaf tissue did not affect the analysis because it was almost completely removed by the detrending that precedes time-series analysis. A simple linear or quadratic model adequately described the time trend. The residuals from the trend had a constant mean and variance, thus ensuring stationarity, a requirement for autocorrelation analysis. The trend over time for c(a) - c(i) was particularly strong (R-2 = 0.290.84). Autoregressive moving average analyses of the residuals from these trends indicated that two-thirds of the individual tree series contained significant autocorrelation, whereas the remaining third were random (white noise) over time. We were unable to distinguish between individuals with and without significant autocorrelation beforehand. Significant ARMA models were all of low order, with either first- or second-order (i.e., lagged 1 or 2 years, respectively) models performing well. A simple autoregressive (AR(1)), model was the most common. The most useful generalization was that the same ARMA model holds for each of the three series (delta C-13, Delta, c(a) - c(i)) for an individual tree, if the time trend has been properly removed for each series. The mean series for the two pine species were described by first-order ARMA models (1-year lags), whereas the Douglas-fir mean series were described by second-order models (2-year lags) with negligible first-order effects. Apparently, the process of constructing a mean time series for a species preserves an underlying signal related to delta C-13 while canceling some of the random individual tree variation. Furthermore, the best model for the overall mean series (e.g., for a species) cannot be inferred from a consensus of the individual tree model forms, nor can its parameters be estimated reliably from the mean of the individual tree parameters. Because two-thirds of the individual tree time series contained significant autocorrelation, the normal assumption of a random structure over time is unwarranted, even after accounting for the time trend. The residuals of an appropriate ARMA model satisfy the independence assumption, and can be used to make hypothesis tests.",0
"The release of methane into the atmosphere by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. can be considered as a two-stage process. The first, a mainly diffusive movement through the rhizosphere from the anaerobic source regions of the soil and into and along the roots to the root-rhizome junction. The second, the removal of the gas from the root-rhizome junction to the atmosphere through the rhizome-culm system, a process often dominated by convective (pressurised) gas how This article addresses the first of these stages and is presented in isolation because of its perceived commonality to wetland plants in general. The model treats the root and its oxygenated rhizosphere as a series of concentric cylinders: two non-(or low) porosity stelar cylinders, a highly porous cortex, a non-porous epidermal/hypodermal cylinder and the rhizosphere itself. The methane source lies at the edge of the oxygenated rhizosphere the dimensions of which are determined by the integrated effects of oxygen consumption in root and rhizosphere (the latter including a methanotrophic element) and the diffusive impedances throughout the system. The results demonstrate something of the complexity of root-methane-oxygen relations. Methane entry from the rhizosphere is shown to vary along the length of any individual root and, as expected, methane oxidation within the rhizosphere is found to reduce the potential for methane loss to the atmosphere. Situations are also revealed: (i) when the methane concentration falls to zero within the rhizosphere because of aerobic microbial consumption supported by radial oxygen loss from the root, and (ii) where methane may enter the root at one point and escape to the rhizosphere at some other. In this latter case, methane concentration minima are possible within the rhizosphere supplied by methane fluxes from both the root and the bulk soil. Predictions of the quantities of methane which might be released via Phragmites roots to the atmosphere accord with examples of those previously reported from field data.

"Pan evaporation, as a surrogate of potential evaporation, is reported to have decreased in different regions of the world since the 1950s. There is much literature to explain the decrease in pan evaporation using the so-called evaporation complimentary relationship hypothesis and it is argued that pan evaporation can be understood as a sign of global warming and indication of an accelerating hydrologic cycle. On the other hand, some scientists insist that the pan evaporation trends may be caused by a global dimming, which effectively reduces the solar radiation to the ground surface. However, few reports are available about the changes in pan evaporation and their implications to water balance in arid regions. In the present study, we investigate the trends in pan evaporation in arid regions of China over the past 50 years and attempt to characterize the changes in water balance in these areas. It is found that pan evaporation in these areas has portrayed a statistically significant decreasing trend, which may be attributed mainly to decreases in wind speed and diurnal temperature range and increase in precipitation. The trends in some major meteorological factors such as pan evaporation, precipitation, temperature, wind speed and others imply an enhanced hydrological cycle in the study area.

"The objective of this experiment was to understand how atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and soil-nitrogen (N) availability influence Populus tremuloides fine-root growth and morphology. Soil-N availability may limit the growth response of forests to elevated CO2 and interact with atmospheric CO2 to alter litter quality and ecosystem carbon (C) and N cycling. We established a CO2 x N factorial field experiment and grew six genotypes of P. tremuloides for 2.5 growing seasons in 20 large open-top chamber/root-box experimental units at the University of Michigan Biological Station in northern lower Michigan (USA). Ln this paper we describe an integrated examination of how atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability influence fine-root morphology, growth, mortality, and biomass. We also studied the relationship between root biomass and total soil respiration. Over 80% of the absorbing root length of P. tremuloides was accounted fur by roots <0.4 mm in diameter, and specific root length(100-250 m/g) was much greater than reports for other temperate and boreal deciduous trees. Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased the diameter and length of individual roots. In contrast, soil N had no effect on root morphology. Fine-root length production and mortality, measured with minirhizotrons, was controlled by the interaction between atmospheric CO2 and soil N. Rates of root production and mortality were significantly greater at elevated CO2 when trees grew in high-N soil, but there were no CO2 effects at low soil N. Fine-root biomass increased 137-194% in high-N compared to low-N soil, and elevated atmospheric CO2 increased fine-root biomass (52%) in high soil N, but differences in low soil N were not significant. Across all treatments, dynamic estimates of net fine-root production were highly correlated with fine-root biomass (soil cores; r = 0.975). Mean rates of soil respiration were more than double in high-N compared to low-N soil. and elevated atmospheric CO2, when compared to ambient atmospheric CO2, increased mean rates of soil respiration 19% in 1995 and 25% in 1996. Across all treatments, total root biomass was linearly related to mean rates of soil respiration (r(2) = 0.96). Our results indicate that atmospheric CO2 and soil-N availability strongly interact to influence P. tremuloides fine-root morphology, growth, and C turnover. Aspen-dominated ecosystems of the future are likely to have greater productivity fueled by greater nutrient uptake due to greater root length production. Further, it appears that elevated atmospheric CO2 will result in greater C inputs to soil through greater rates of fine-root production and turnover, especially in high-fertility soils. Increased C inputs to soil result in greater rates of soil respiration. At this rime, it is not clear what effects increased rates of root turnover will have on C storage in the soil.",0
"Impatiens comprises more than 1000 species and is one of the largest genera of flowering plants. The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, yet most of its evolutionary history is unknown. Diversification analyses, divergence time estimates and historical biogeography, illustrated that the extant species of Impatiens originated in Southwest China and started to diversify in the Early Miocene. Until the Early Pliocene, the net diversification rate within the genus was fairly slow. Since that time, however, approximately 80% of all Impatiens lineages have originated. This period of rapid diversification coincides with the global cooling of the Earth's climate and subsequent glacial oscillations. Without this accelerated diversification rate, Impatiens would only have contained 1/5th of its current number of species, thereby indicating the rapid radiation of the genus. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

"Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes are largely controlled by the small but highly bio-reactive, labile pools of these elements in terrestrial soils, while long-term C and N storage is determined by the long-lived recalcitrant fractions. Changes in the size of these pools and redistribution among them in response to global warming may considerably affect the long-term terrestrial C and N storage. However, such changes have not been carefully examined in field warming experiments. This study used sulfuric acid hydrolysis to quantify changes in labile and recalcitrant C and N fractions of soil in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem that had been continuously warmed with or without clipping for about 2.5 years. Warming significantly increased labile C and N fractions in the unclipped plots, resulting in increments of 373 mg C kg(-1) dry soil and 15 mg N kg-1 dry soil, over this period whilst clipping significantly decreased such concentrations in the warmed plots. Warming also significantly increased soil microbial biomass C and N in the unclipped plots, and increased ratios of soil microbial/labile C and N, indicating an increase in microbial C- and N-use efficiency. Recalcitrant and total C and N contents were not significantly affected by warming. For all measured pools, only labile and microbial biomass C fractions showed significant interactions between warming and clipping, indicating the dependence of the warming effects on clipping. Our results suggest that increased soil labile and microbial C and N fractions likely resulted indirectly from warming increases in plant biomass input, which may be larger than warming-enhanced decomposition of labile organic compounds.

"Mitochondrial DNA characterization of the sandfly Phlebotomus perniciosus has not resolved the population structure of its Iberian lineage. For this purpose, four AGC- and seven AGG-class microsatellite loci were characterized, after their isolation using Biotin-Avidin enrichment and the screening of plasmid libraries by polymerase chain reaction. Of the five polymorphic loci analysed in four Spanish populations, four showed patterns of allele diversity consistent with migration from a southern Ice Age refuge. Estimates of the historical migration rates of P. perniciosus will help to predict the effects of global warming on its range and that of Leishmania infantum, the parasitic protozoan it transmits.",0
"The response of oceanic phytoplankton to climate forcing in the Arctic Ocean has attracted increasing attention due to its special geographical position and potential susceptibility to global warming. Here, we examine the relationship between satellite-derived (sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor, SeaWiFS) surface chlorophyll-a (CHL) distribution and climatic conditions in the Barents Sea (30-35 degrees E, 70-80 degrees N) for the period 1998-2002. We separately examined the regions north and south of the Polar Front (similar to 76 degrees N). Although field data are rather limited, the satellite CHL distribution was generally consistent with cruise observations. The temporal and spatial distribution of CHL was strongly influenced by the light regime, mixed layer depth, wind speed and ice cover. Maximum CHL values were found in the marginal sea-ice zone (72-73 degrees N) and not in the ice-free region further south (70-71 degrees N). This indicates that melt-water is an important contributor to higher CHL production. The vernal phytoplankton bloom generally started in late March, reaching its peak in late April. A second, smaller CHL peak occurred regularly in late summer (September). Of the 5 years, 2002 had the highest CHL production in the southern region, likely due to earlier ice melting and stronger solar irradiance in spring and summer.",0
"Air-cycle refrigeration systems have been used in aircraft for over 50 years due to their high durability. This paper discusses a possible substitution of an air-cycle system for a conventional vapour-compression system for transport applications. Air is a totally environmental benign working-fluid that does not lead to ozone depletion or global warming. A detailed design and performance estimation have been carried out for a high-pressure water-removal air-cycle system. In addition, a train compartment equipped with this air-cycle system has been investigated. The results show that the system is suitable for transport vessels, such as trains and ships, especially for the purpose of cooling in summer because re-using the condensed water can improve the performance of the system significantly.

"Temperature profiles from the active layer have been analysed for 2 sites on the composed rockglacier Morenas Coloraclas. Cordon del Plata, Mendoza, Argentina, using monitoring data collected between 1989 and 2008 in order to characterize the impact of global warming in the cryolithozone of the Dry Andes at these latitudes (32 degrees-33 degrees S). A significant change in the active layer and suprapermafrost of this rockglacier of the Cordon del Plata is registered at the monitoring sites. The observed changes imply direct consequences for the cryogenic environment and the Andean creeping permafrost. The nose of the Morenas Coloradas rockglacier for example (Balcon I, 3560 m a.s.l.), already expresses inactivity; the permafrost table is found at great depth (7.5-9 m). Data collected at Balcon I and II allow to estimate the theoretical thermal diffusivity alpha at the active layer of Morenas Coloraclas. Thermal diffusivity may be decisive for the study of cryogenic dynamics at other altitudes and latitudes in the region where data are still scarce. Low alpha values (<0.2 x 10(-6)m(2)/s) correlate with occurrence of freezing and ice at low altitudes. While the glaciers are turning into small insignificant bodies in the high mountains, the periglacial level with creeping permafrost and linked with rockglaciers is expanding altitudinally, passing a transitional ""rooting"" area which is indirectly feeding the rockglaciers with their covered or ""dead ice"". The ice of glacigenic origin contributes to the genesis of this type of permafrost. As the permafrost table is found at greater depths, the rockglaciers need to be monitored in order to define a balance between the upper periglacial level (in terms of altitude) with mountain continuous-quasi continuous permafrost and the lower periglacial level to where the lowest fronts of creeping permafrost are reaching. The variations of the cryogenic structure of the rockglaciers of the Cordon del Plata caused by warming processes, will have direct consequences for the volume of frozen sediments and therefore for the hydrology of the entire region, a fact that has to be taken into account for future socio-economic programs of the respective provincial governments.

"Methane emissions were measured by a closed chamber method in rice plots with sandy, loamy, and clayey soil, respectively, under a water regime consisting of a flooding and draining cycle in Fengqiu, Henan Province, China in 1993 and 1994. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured for every two measurements of CH4 flux in 1994. The results showed that CH4 emissions were low compared with those recorded in previous reports and the means of CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.16 to 86 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in the growing season (108 d). The lowest mean flux of CH4 was observed in the clayey plot in both years. Statistically, soil temperature and soil Eh at 5 cm depth significantly affected the fluctuations of the CH4 flux measured in the morning and afternoon, but they were not the main factors controlling the seasonal variation of the CH4 flux. Flooding and draining cycle, as well as high rate of water percolation and low organic matter content of the soils resulted in low emissions of CH4. In contrast, the studied plots had high emissions of N2O, ranging from - 9.02 to 1,640 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), with arithmetic means of 168.8, 76.9, and 65.2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) in the sandy, loamy, and clayey plots, respectively, which were comparable in magnitude to those observed in cultivated upland soils. Flooding and draining cycle, i.e., dynamics of water status in the studied plots, was considered to be an important factor controlling N2O emission. Therefore, the mitigating effect of CH4 emission under the water regime would be offset by an increase in N2O emission. Rice fields where water management involves intermittent draining may contribute substantially to the total amount of N2O emitted to the atmosphere.",0
"Carbon halides, especially halons (bromofluorocarbons), are compounds known to deplete the ozone layer and contribute to global warming. Appropriate treatments to decompose halon waste is important to protect the environment. A dry process to decompose halon has been developed. Solid alkaline carbonate and hydrate obtained from dolomite were prepared for the reactants to decompose halon and to react with the fluorine and bromine produced by the halon decomposition. Twelve kinds of reactants were obtained by changing the burning temperature and burning time. The amount of the decomposed halon and the conversion were correlated with the pore distributions in the reactants. The distributions of F and Br differed depending on the preparation of the reactants. The difference would be attributed to the reactivity and the diffusion rate of the gases produced by the decomposing halon.",0
"The production of food protein has a considerable impact on the environment. This paper investigates the potential environmental benefits of introducing more grain legumes in human nutrition. Four meals with different amounts of soybeans or peas (either used as feed for production of pork or directly consumed) were analysed using life cycle assessment methodology. The results of this analysis demonstrate that it is environmentally favourable to replace meat with peas. In particular, the addition of more legumes to human nutrition potentially aids in the reduction of global warming, eutrophication, acidification, and land use; however, in terms of energy use, a completely vegetarian pea burger meal requires the same amount of energy as other meat-containing meals. Feeding pigs with European-produced peas instead of imported soybeans, in addition to partial replacement (10%) of meat protein with pea protein, failed to reduce the environmental impact of the meal. In summary, peas can be considered 'green', but there remains a significant need for more energy-efficient processing of vegetarian products. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"The carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil-fuel emissions by 0.4 to 2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions.",0
"We study the solar impact on 400 years of a global surface temperature record since 1600. This period includes the pre-industrial era ( roughly 1600 - 1800 or 1600 - 1900), when negligible amount of anthropogenic-added climate forcing was present and the sun realistically was the only climate force affecting climate on a secular scale, and the industrial era ( roughly since 1800 - 1900), when anthropogenic-added climate forcing has been present in some degree. We use a recent secular Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction (Moberg et al., 2005), three alternative total solar irradiance (TSI) proxy reconstructions ( Lean et al., 1995; Lean, 2000; Wang et al., 2005) and a scale-by-scale transfer climate sensitivity model to solar changes (Scafetta and West, 2005, 2006). The phenomenological approach we propose is an alternative to the more traditional computer-based climate model approach, and yields results proven to be almost independent on the secular TSI proxy reconstruction used. We find good correspondence between global temperature and solar induced temperature curves during the pre-industrial period such as the cooling periods occurring during the Maunder Minimum ( 1645 - 1715) and the Dalton Minimum ( 1795 1825). The sun might have contributed approximately 50% of the observed global warming since 1900 ( Scafetta and West, 2006). We briefly discuss the global cooling that occurred from the medieval maximum ( approximate to 1000 - 1100 AD) to the 17th century minimum.",0
"Systematic studies on the cryosphere in China started in the late 1950s. Significant achievements have been made by continuous investigation of glacier inventories, frozen ground observations, paleo-climate analyses of ice cores, process studies and the modeling of cryopsheric/atmospheric interactions. The general facts and understanding of these changes include: (1) Solid precipitation, including the number of days with frost and hail storms, shows a decreasing tendency over the past half century. (2) In most areas glaciers are retreating or have completely vanished (>80%), some glaciers are still advancing (5%-20% depending upon time period). The annual glacial melt water has been increasing since the 1980s. This increased supply of melt water to river runoff in Northwest China is about a 10%-13%. (3) The long-term variability of snow cover in western China is characterized by a large inter-annual variation superimposed on a small increasing trend. Snow cover variability in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (QXP) is influenced by the Indian monsoon, and conversely impacts monsoon onset and strength and eventually the drought and flood events in middle-low reaches of Yangtze River. (4) Frozen ground, including permafrost, is decaying both in QXP and in Northeast China. The most significant changes occurred in the regions with thickest seasonal frozen ground (SFG), i.e., inland QXP, then northeastern and northwestern QXP. The cold season air temperature is the main factor controlling SFG change. The increase of ground surface temperatures is more significant than air temperature. (5) The sea ice coverage over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea has deceased since the 1980s. (6) River ice duration and ice thickness is also decreasing in northern China. In 2001, the Chinese National Committee of World Climate Research Program/Climate and Cyosphere (WCRP/CliC) (CNC-CliC) was organized to strengthen research on climate and cryosphere in China. Future monitoring of the cryosphere in China will be enhanced both in spatial coverage and through the use of new techniques. Interactions between atmosphere/cryosphere/ hydrosphere/land-surface will be assessed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of cryospheric change.",0
"P> Climate extremes are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude as a consequence of global warming. 2. Managed permanent grasslands cover a large surface in Europe and contribute substantially to agricultural production. These managed plant communities are dominated by perennial clonal species. Their capacity to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions may be limited. 3. We hypothesize that those plant populations that have already been exposed to conditions that are expected to occur due to future climate change, particularly conditions that would be 'extreme' in the target area, are able to cope better with these conditions. 4. For a common-garden experiment we selected ecotypes (provenances as supported by accessions in seed banks) of important European grass species: Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca pratensis, Holcus lanatus and Alopecurus pratensis. Southern target locations of ecotypes (populations) were identified based on climate model projections for the local site in Northern Bavaria, Germany. 5. In a controlled experiment, the plants were exposed to warming and extreme drought. Drought conditions(16-19 days, depending on the species) were imposed starting from the end of May in combination with and without an increase in the average temperature from May to September 2009 (+5 K compared with control; +2.5 K compared with ambient conditions outside of the experimental units). 6. Ecotypes and drought manipulation had significant impacts on biomass production and tissue die-back. Significant interactions between ecotype and drought indicated a different drought tolerance of the ecotypes in some cases. The warming treatment yielded a less significant response. The local ecotype generally did not perform significantly worse than the presumably better-adapted southern ecotypes. 7. Synthesis. The selection of ecotypes that are adapted to more extreme climatic conditions could be an option for maintaining future ecosystem functioning in temperate managed grasslands, as was indicated by the clear differences between ecotypes in our experiment. Based on our data, however, performance cannot be predicted from climatic origin. Therefore, we recommend enhancing the genetic variability within populations of species in general.",0
"SUGIURA T., KURODA H., SUGIURA H. & HONJO H. 2005. Prediction of effects of global warming on apple production regions in Japan. - Phyton (Horn, Austria) 45 (4): (419)-(422). Most of apple trees have been cultivated in the northern part of temperate zone in Japan, since they are suitable for planting in cold climates. The crops produced in a cold area may be greatly influenced by warming. This study is undertaken to assess the impact of global warming on the production of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) in Japan. The temperature ranges assumed to be appropriate for the cultivation of apple are 6-14 degrees C on annual mean temperature and 13-21 degrees C on mean temperature from April to October, respectively. The database of ""Climate Change Mesh Data (Japan)"" was used to simulate possible changes in favorable regions for the cultivation of apple with approximately 10 by 10 km resolution. The mesh data derived from IPCC IS92a-type emission scenario and four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (A-O GCMs). It was predicted that the favorable regions to cultivate apples will gradually move northward. All the plains of southern Tohoku in 2040's and central Tohoku in 2060's will be unfavorable for apple cultivation, while most of regions in Hokkaido will be suitable by 2060's. Many parts of the current apple producing districts in Japan will be possibly unfavorable by 2060's. Therefore, global warming will greatly affect the cultivation environment of apples in Japan by the middle of the 21st century.",0
"To improve our understanding of the climate process and to assess the human impact on current global warming, past climate reconstruction is essential. The chemical composition of a bivalve shell is strongly coupled to environmental variations and therefore ancient shells are potential climate archives. The nonlinear nature of the relation between environmental condition (e.g. the seawater temperature) and proxy composition makes it hard to predict the former from the latter, however. In this paper we compare the ability of three nonlinear system identification methods to reconstruct the ambient temperature from the chemical composition of a shell. The comparison shows that nonlinear multi-proxy approaches are potentially useful tools for climate reconstructions and that manifold based methods result in smoother and more precise temperature reconstruction.

"Understanding the movement of animals is critical to many aspects of conservation such as spread of emerging disease, proliferation of invasive species, changes in land-use patterns, and responses to global climate change. Movement processes are especially important for amphibian management and conservation as species declines and extinctions worldwide become ever more apparent. To better integrate behavioral and ecological data on amphibian movements with our use of spatially explicit demographic models and guide effective conservation solutions, I present 1) a synopsis of the literature regarding behavior, ecology, and evolution of movement in pond-breeding amphibians possessing biphasic life cycles to distinguish between migration and dispersal processes, 2) a working hypothesis of juvenile-based dispersal, and 3) a discussion of conservation issues that follow from distinguishing the spatial and temporal movements of amphibians at different scales. I define amphibian migration as intrapopulational, round-trip movements toward and away from aquatic breeding sites. Population-level management, in general, can be focused on spatial scales of <0 km with attention focused on adult population and juveniles that remain near the natal wetland. I define amphibian dispersal as interpopulational, unidirectional movements from natal sites to other breeding sites. Metapopulation- or landscape-level management can be focused on movements among populations at spatial scales >0-10.0 km and on importance of terrestrial connectivity. The ultimate goal of conservation for amphibians should be long-term regional persistence by addressing management issues at both local and metapopulation scales.",0
"Models of terrestrial vegetation distribution change during warming have generally paid little attention to ecological disturbances such as fire, even though these have been shown to be vitally important. A model predicting regionally dominant terrestrial vegetation in catastrophically disturbed landscapes is proposed: probability of a disturbance adapted species leaving progeny (P-r) is (1-1/M)(j)-(1-1/M)(s), where M is the mean return interval between disturbances, j is the age of organisms at onset of reproduction, and s is the age at which reproduction ceases. For non disturbance-adapted species, the model simplifies to (1-1/M)(j). The model was tested in fire-prone boreal forest landscapes in Ontario, Canada (48 degrees 00'-52 degrees 00'N, 80 degrees 00'-95 degrees 30'W). A vegetation map whose classes and class geographical distributions were predicted using the above model was compared with a standard vegetation map. Three upland vegetation classes: poplar-pine, spruce-pine-poplar and spruce-fir were predicted, as well as an organic class representing non fire-prone vegetation on peat. These classes were almost the same as those in the standard map and the vegetation distribution was comparable (vegetation correctly predicted for 64% of the area, chi square P < 0.005). Thus the model can predict dominant vegetation in this system, implying that the distribution of boreal biome subzones in central Canada is largely governed by fire occurrence. To predict climate warming impacts, fire in the model was increased to 5 and 5 times the 1926-75 area, with a resultant shift of predicted vegetation zones to the north and east.",0
"Active-layer monitoring and the permafrost thermal regime are key indicators of climate change. The results of 3 years (1997-1999) of active-layer monitoring at one high-mountain site (La Foppa, 46degrees28' 42"" N; 10degrees11' 18"" E, 2670 m a.s.l.) and at one Antarctic site (Boulder Clay, 74degrees44' 45"" S; 164degrees01' 17"" E, 205 m a.s.l) are presented. The initial analysis of a thermal profile in a borehole (100.3 m deep) within mountain permafrost at Stelvio (3000 m a.s.l., 46degrees30' 59""N; 10degrees28' 35"" E) is also presented. At the alpine site, the active-layer thickness variations (between 193 and 229 cm) relate to both the snow cover and to the air temperature changes. By contrast, at the Antarctic site, there is a strong direct linkage only between air temperature fluctuations and active-layer variations. At the alpine (La Foppa) site, the relationship between climate and active-layer thickness is complicated by thermal offset that is almost negligible at both the Stelvio and Antarctic sites. The permafrost temperature profile at Stelvio site contains a climate signal suitable for paleoclimate reconstruction. The permafrost at this site has a mean annual ground surface temperature (MAGST) of - 9degreesC (during 1998/1999), an active layer of about 2.5 in thick and a total thickness of - 200 m. Analysis of the MAGST history, obtained by applying a simple heat conduction one-dimensional model, revealed the occurrence of a cold period from 1820 to 1940 followed by a warming period until 1978. Since the beginning of the 1980s, temperature dropped (less than 2degreesC) until the middle 1990s, when a new period of warming started. All these climatic changes fit well with the glacial fluctuations in the area and with other paleoclimatic information derived from different proxy data. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"Day and night sampling of windborne arthropods at a height of 200 m above ground was undertaken at Cardington, Bedfordshire, UK, during July 1999, 2000 and 2002, using a net supported by a tethered balloon. The results from this study are compared with those from the classic aerial sampling programmes carried out by Hardy, Freeman and colleagues over the UK and North Sea in the 1930s. In the present study, aerial netting was undertaken at night as well as daytime, and so the diel periodicity of migration could be investigated, and comparisons made with the results from Lewis and Taylor's extensive survey of flight periodicity near ground level. In some taxa with day-time emigration, quite large populations could continue in high-altitude flight after dark, perhaps to a previously underrated extent, and this would greatly increase their potential migratory range. Any trend towards increases in night temperatures, associated with global warming, would facilitate movements of this type in the UK. Observations on the windborne migration of a variety of species, particularly those of economic significance or of radar-detectable size, are briefly discussed.",0
"Different quantitative methods have been developed to determine paleo-rainfall using paleosols. Of particular interest are methods that use bulk geochemistry to calculate a weathering index and, from that, mean annual precipitation. Twenty-three paleosols that formed during a time of significant climate change-the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)-were analyzed to evaluate the relative merits of two geochemical proxies that have been developed for estimating paleoprecipitation: one depends on the chemical index of alteration without potash (CIA-K) and the other uses the CALMAG weathering index, which depends on CaO and MgO. The paleosols are located in the Paleogene Fort Union and Willwood formations in the Bighorn Basin, WY. Morphologic differences among the paleosols indicate that they formed under varied soil moisture conditions. A morphology index was developed from pedogenic features that are sensitive to soil drainage, and thus to rainfall, to assess that variability. Quantitative mean annual precipitation (MAP) values were calculated for each paleosol using the CIA-K index and the CALMAG index, which was developed specifically for Vertisols. Those results were compared to the morphology index for 23 paleosols. The results indicate that increases and decreases in MAP calculated from both methods correlate relatively well to changes in the soil morphology index; however, the results from the CALMAG weathering index show a stronger correlation. The results suggest that the CALMAG proxy provides a more robust MAP estimate for Vertisols. In addition to comparing MAP estimates to the soil morphology index, we compared the MAP values to paleorainfall estimates determined from paleofloras at the same stratigraphic levels as three of the paleosols. That comparison confirms that the CALMAG method is reliable for reconstructing MAP from ancient Vertisols. The results also show that, in the Bighorn Basin, Vertisols with a B horizon <1 m thick should not be used to determine MAP. Thinner paleosols have had less time for weathering and may not have cation distributions representative of precipitation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the environmental impacts of a beef cow-calf system using a life cycle assessment (LCA) method and to investigate the effects of scenarios to reduce environmental impacts on the LCA results. The functional unit was defined as one marketed beef calf, and the processes associated with the cow-calf life cycle, such as feed production, feed transport, animal management, the biological activity of the animal and the treatment of cattle waste were included in the system boundary. The present results showed that the total contributions of one beef calf throughout its life cycle to global warming, acidification, eutrophication and energy consumption were 4550 kg of CO2 equivalents, 40.1 kg of SO2 equivalents, 7.0 kg of phosphate (PO4) equivalents and 16.1 GJ, respectively. The contribution of each process to the total environmental impact in each environmental impact category showed a similar tendency to the contribution of each process in each environmental category reported in the case of the beef fattening system as a whole. The results from this analysis showed that shortening calving intervals by 1 month reduced environmental impacts by 5.7-5.8% in all the environmental impact categories examined in the current study, and increasing the number of calves per cow also reduced environmental impacts in all the categories, although the effects were smaller.",0
"On April 9, 2000, a super-large landslide (3 x 10(8) m(3)) occurred along Zhamu Creek, southeast Tibet. As a result, a landslide dam formed and the Yigong River was blocked. A channelized diversion was constructed for prevention of overtopping. Two months later on June 10, a catastrophic flood resulting from the failure of the landslide dam caused a serious loss of property. This is the second of landslide occasion dam formation and flooding occurrence at the same site since 1900. In this paper we introduce the background and occurrence of the landslide, report the dam failure and overflow process, and finally discuss the origin of the landslide and of the flood in comparison with statistical characteristics of previous case histories worldwide. Many large and small landslides will continue to occur because of the distinctive physiographic, geological and climatic conditions in this region. What we can do is perhaps only to predict and avoid them. With predicted global warming, water availability has become more and more important for landslide occurrence. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

"This paper, prepared by the Climate Change Technology Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Power and Energy Society Energy Development and Power Generation Committee, identifies key technical issues facing the electric power industry, related to global climate change. The technical challenges arise from: 1) impacts on system operating strategies, configuration, and expansion plans of emission-reducing technologies; 2) power infrastructure response to extreme weather events; 3) effects of government policies including an expanded use of renewable and alternative energy technologies; and 4) impacts of market rules on power system operation. Possible lessons from other industries' responses to climate change are explored.",0
"Of the many mechanisms by which global climate change may alter ecosystem processes perhaps the least known and insidious is altered disturbance regimes. We used a field-based experiment to examine the climate change scenario of more frequent fires with altered invertebrate assemblages on the decomposition of Eucalyptus leaves. Our design comprised three fire regimes [long-term fire exclusion (FE), long-term frequent burning (FB) and FE altered to FB (FEFB)] and two litter bag mesh sizes (8.0 and 0.2 mm) that either permitted or denied access to the leaf litter by most invertebrates. We found a significant interaction effect between fire regime and mesh size in losses of litter mass and net carbon (C). Compared with the regime of FE, with more frequent burning (FB and FEFB) the pace of decomposition was slowed by 41% (when access to litter by most invertebrates is not impeded). For the regime of FE, denying access to leaf litter by most invertebrates did not alter the pace of decomposition. Conversely, under regimes of frequently burning, restricting access to the litter by most invertebrates altered the pace of decomposition by 46%. Similar results were found for net C. For net losses of nitrogen (N), no interaction effects between fire regime and mesh size were detected, although both main effects were significant. Our results show that by modifying disturbance regimes such as fire frequency, global climate change has the potential to modify the mechanism by which ecosystems function. With more FB, decomposition is driven not only by fire regime induced changes in substrate quality and/or physiochemical conditions but through the interaction of disturbance regime with animal assemblages mediating ecosystem processes.",0
"This paper studies an evaluation of climatological reproducibility and one of future climate projections of extreme precipitation in the Baiu season (from mid-May to July) around Japan using data of numerical experiments. The models are a non-hydrostatic cloud-system-resolving atmospheric model with a horizontal grid size of 5 km (5km-NHM) utilized as a regional climate model (RCM), and an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) with a horizontal resolution of about 20 kin (20km-AGCM) which provided the boundary condition of 5km-NHM. Ten-year runs were performed by the time-slice method. The mean precipitation amount of the three heaviest precipitation events that ranked in order of precipitation amount in every year (P-Top3) at each grid point was used as an index to examine quantitatively extreme precipitation within a specific term with various precipitation accumulation periods (APs). The 5km-NHM experiment reproduced P-Top3 much better than that of 20km-AGCM, especially for shorter APs. In the projection of P-Top3 in the future climate with 5km-NHM, ratio in two climate states of P-Top3 for longer APs and that of precipitation amount show the roughly same pattern. The increase areas of those were localized around Kyushu, Japan. In particular, the P-Top3 for longer APs was projected to increase 30-70% in the mountainous areas along the Pacific coast of western Japan. This increase was due to a cyclonic circulation of an incremental low-pressure generated on the western side of Kyushu. On the other hand, large increases of P-Top3 for shorter APs spread widely with a scattered pattern to the area where precipitation decreases. Ibis characteristic was associated with the intensification of precipitation due to global warming.",0
"Glaciers are one of the most important land covers in alpine regions and especially sensitive to global climate change. Remote sensing has proved to be the best method of investigating the extent of glacial variations in remote mountainous areas. Using Landsat thematic mapping (TM) and multi-spectral-scanner (MSS) images from Mt. Qomolangma (Everest) National Nature Preserve (QNNP), central high Himalayas for 1976, 1988 and 2006, we derived glacial extent for these three periods. A combination of object-oriented image interpretation methods, expert knowledge rules and field surveys were employed. Results showed that (1) the glacial area in 2006 was 2710.17 +/- 0.011 km(2) (about 7.41% of the whole study area), and located mainly to the south and between 4700 m to 6800 m above sea level; (2) from 1976 to 2006, glaciers reduced by 5091 +/- 0.035 km(2) and glacial lakes expanded by 36.88 +/- 0.035 km(2); the rate of glacier retreat was higher in sub-basins on the southern slopes (16.79%) of the Himalayas than on the northern slopes (14.40%); most glaciers retreated, and mainly occurred at an elevation of 4700-6400 m, and the estimated upper limit of the retreat zone is between 6600 m and 6700 m; (3) increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation over the study period are the key factors driving retreat.",0
"Chum and pink salmon abundances vary on a decadal time-scale. We examined the relationship between large-scale climate indices (Os), regional climate factors (RFs), and rates of change in regional catches (RCs) of chum and pink salmon in five regions of the North Pacific. Correlation coefficients of RCs with RFs were larger than those of RCs with CIs, although the correlation coefficient of particular variables varied among regions. Climate affected salmon stocks as indicated by significant relationships with various terrestrial and ocean climate factors on a regional scale. These results suggest that no single CI or RF controls salmon abundance in all regions; however, global climate changes could affect regional climate directly and regional salmon abundance indirectly. A warming trend in the North Pacific might affect the long-term change in salmon abundance. The mechanisms controlling regional salmon abundance must be understood better to forecast successfully future conditions for Pacific salmon stocks, because the response of salmon stocks to global climate change varies among regions.",0
"If global warming curs in California, daily mean temperatures may increase by 3 to 5-degrees-C, precipitation patterns will change, and sea level may rise 1 m. Studies were done on effect of temperature changes on survival of Culex tarsalis Coquillett, the primary vector of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses, in two regions where temperatures differed by 5-degrees-C. Daily mortality of adult vectors increased by 1% for each 1-degrees-C increase in temperature. At 25-degrees-C, only 5% of Cx. tarsalis survived for 8 or more days, the time required for extrinsic incubation of these viruses. Extrinsic incubation times for these viruses shortened when temperatures were increased from 18 to 25-degrees-C. WEE virus infection was modulated and transmission decreased at 32-degrees-C. If temperatures in the warmer region increase by 5-degrees-C, WEE virus may disappear and SLE virus would persist. In the cooler region, a 5-degrees-C increase would decrease vector survivorship and virus activity in midsummer. In North America, epidemics of WEE have prevailed above a 21-degrees-C isotherm and those of SLE below this isotherm. With global warming, epidemics of these viruses could extend into currently unreceptive northern areas. WEE virus would disappear from more southern regions. Geographic distribution of vector, human, and animal populations could be altered. North America could become more receptor to invasion by tropical vectors and diseases.",0
"Loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) can cause soil degradation, which may not only undermine soil productivity, but may also-affect environmental health. In China, a huge amount of crop residues is regularly removed from the fields, and therefore China's agriculture depends on high levels of chemical fertilizer inputs. This paper aims to estimate the SOC storage in Chinese cropland, identify its changing trends under current cropping systems, and finally put forward some strategies to keep the SOC in balance. A computer simulation model of carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry in agro-ecosystems (DeNitrification and DeComposition or DNDC) was applied to predict SOC dynamics in the upper (0-30 cm) soil layer of agricultural ecosystems at national scale. Data on climate, soil properties, cropping systems, acreage, and management practices at county scale were collected from various sources and integrated into a GIS database to support the model runs. The model results revealed (1) the total SOC storage in croplands in China is about 3968 Tg C; and (2) SOC is lost at a rate of 78.89 Tg C/year. The highest losses of SOC occur in the northeastern provinces. Chinese cropland soils release 186 Tg C as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and receive only 68 Tg C from crop residues annually. Considering the potential of global warming, SOC loss in cropland could be a serious contributor. Strategies to reduce the loss of SOC in Chinese cropland are proposed based on DNDC model runs for a number of scenarios under different management practices. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

"Growing concerns about global climate change, biodiversity maintenance, natural resources conservation, and long-term ecosystem sustainability have been responsible for the transformation of traditional single resource management approaches into integrated ecosystem management models. Eco-regions are large ecosystems of regional extent that contain smaller ecosystems of similar response potential and resource production capabilities. They can be used as a geographical framework for organizing and reporting resource information, setting bioecological recovery criteria, extrapolating site-level management, and monitoring global change. The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative, multivariate regionalization model that is capable of delineating eco-regions at multiple levels from remotely sensed information and other environmental and natural resources spatial data. The Spatial Pattern Analysis Model developed in this study uses a region-growing algorithm to generate spatially contiguous regions from primitive polygonal land units. The algorithm merges the most similar pair of neighbouring units at each iteration, based on satisfying certain similarity criteria until all units are grouped into one. This model was utilized to develop an eco-region map of Nebraska with three hierarchical levels. In the mapping process, the STATSGO data set was used to build the primitive map units. Environmental parameters included in the model were multi-temporal AVHRR data, soil rooting depth, organic matter content, available water capacity, and long-term annual averages of water balance and growing degree day totals. Development of the model provides a new and useful approach to eco-region mapping for resource managers and researchers. The method is automated and efficient, reduces the judgement biases and uncertainty of manual analyses, and can be replicated for other regions or for the regionalization of other themes.",0
"Carbon cycling and the global warming potential (GWP) of bioenergy cropping systems with complete biomass removal are of agronomic and environmental concern. Corn growers who plan to remove corn stover as a feedstock for the emerging cellulosic ethanol industry will benefit from carbon amendments such as manure and compost, to replace carbon removed with the corn stover. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of beef cattle feedlot manure and composted dairy manure on short-term carbon sequestration rates and net global warming potential (GWP) in a corn-soybean rotation with complete corn-stover removal. Field experiments consisting of a corn-soybean rotation with whole-plant corn harvest, were conducted near East Lansing, MI over a three-year period beginning in 2002. Compost and manure amendments raised soil carbon (C) at a level sufficient to overcome the C debt associated with manure production, manure collection and storage, land application, and post-application field emissions. The net GWP in carbon dioxide equivalents for the manure and compost amended cropping systems was -934 and -784 g m(-2) y(-1), respectively, compared to 52 g m(-2) y(-1) for the non-manure amended synthetic fertilizer check. This work further substantiates the environmental benefits associated with renewable fuels and demonstrates that with proper management, the integration of livestock manures in biofuel cropping systems can enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) remediation.

"Energy efficiency of agriculture needs improvement to reduce the dependency on non-renewable energy sources. We estimated the energy flows of a wheat-maize-soybean-maize rotation of three different cropping systems: (i) low-input integrated farming (LI), (ii) integrated farming following European Regulations (IFS), and (iii) conventional farming (CONV). Balancing N fertilization with actual crop requirements and adopting minimum tillage proved the most efficient techniques to reduce energy inputs, contributing 64.7% and 12% respectively to the total reduction. Large differences among crops in energy efficiency (maize: 2.2 MJ kg(-1) grain; wheat: 2.6 MJ kg(-1) grain; soybean: 4.1 MJ kg(-1) grain) suggest that crop rotation and crop management can be equally important in determining cropping system energy efficiency. Integrated farming techniques improved energy efficiency by reducing energy inputs without affecting energy outputs. Compared with CONV, energy use efficiency increased 34% and 32.7% in IFS and LI, respectively, while obtaining similar net energy values. Including SOM evolution in the energy analysis greatly enhanced the energy performance of IFS and, even more dramatically. LI compared to CONV. Improved energy efficiency suggests the adoption of alternative farming systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, a thorough evaluation should include net global warming potential assessment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Global climate change is altering the ecology of infectious agents and driving the emergence A disease in people, domestic animals, and wildlife. We present a novel, empirically based, predictive model for the impact of climate warming on development rates and availability of an important parasitic nematode of muskoxen in the Canadian Arctic, a region that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Using this model, we show that warming in the Arctic may have already radically altered the transmission dynamics of this parasite, escalating infection pressure for muskoxen, and that this trend is expected to continue. This work establishes a foundation for understanding responses to climate change of other host-parasite systems, in the Arctic and globally.",0
"The rate constant for the reaction of the hydroxyl radical with 1,1,1,7,7-pentafluorobutane (HFC-365mfc) has been determined over the temperature range 278-323 K using a relative rate technique. The results provide a value of k(OH + CF3CH2CF2CH3) = 2.0 X 10(-12) exp(- 1750 +/- 400/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) based on k(OH + CH3CCl3) = 8 X 10(-12) exp (- 1550 +/- 150/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) for the rate constant of the reference reaction. Assuming the major atmospheric removal process is via reaction with OH in the troposphere, the rate constant data from this work gives an estimate of 10.8 years for the tropospheric lifetime of HFC-365mfc. The overall atmospheric lifetime obtained by taking into account a minor contribution from degradation in the stratosphere, is estimated to be 10.2 years. The rate constant for the reaction of Cl atoms with 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane was also determined at 298 +/- 2 K using the relative rate method, k(Cl + CF3CH2CF2CH3) = (1 +/- 0.3) x 10(-15) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The chlorine initiated photooxidation of CF3CH2CF2CH3 was investigated from 273-330 K and as a function of O-2 pressure at 1 atmosphere total pressure using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy Under all conditions the major carbon-containing products were CF2O and CO2, with smaller amounts of CF3O3CF3. In order to ascertain the relative importance of hydrogen abstraction from the -CH2- and -CH3 groups in CF3CH2CF2CH3, rate constants for the reaction of OH radicals and CI atoms with the structurally similar compounds CF3CH2CCl2F and CF3CH2CF3 were also determined at 298 K k(OH + CF3CH2CCl2F) = (8 +/- 3) X 10(-16) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1); k(OH + CF3CH2CF3) = (3.5 +/- 5) X 10(-16) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1); k(Cl + CF3CH2CCl2F) = (3.5 +/- 5) X 10(-17) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)]; k(Cl + CF3CH2CF3) < 1 X 10(-17) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The results indicate that the most probable site for H-atom abstraction from CF3CH2CF2CH3 is the methyl group and that the formation of carbonyl compounds containing more than a single carbon atom will be negligible under atmospheric conditions, carbonyl difluoride and carbon dioxide being the main degradation products. Finally, accurate infrared absorption cross-sections have been measured for CF3CH2CF2CH3, and jointly used with the calculated overall atmospheric lifetime of 10.2 years, in the NCAR chemical-radiative model, to determine the radiative forcing of climate by this CFC alternative. The steady-state Halocarbon Global Warming Potential, relative to CFC-11, is 0.17. The Global Warming Potentials relative to CO2 are found to be 2210, 790, and 250, for integration time-horizons of 20, 100, and 500 years, respectively. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",0
"Gas hydrates are crystalline solids that form from mixtures of water and light natural gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, ethane, propane, and butane. The Black Sea is the world's most isolated sea. Methane exists as gas hydrates or methane clathrate form in the Black Sea. Gas hydrates potential in the Black Sea is investigated as a source of methane. Methane gas hydrate is a solid combination of methane and ice. It is found under continental shelves and on land under permafrost and can contain from 80-99.9% of methane. Gas hydrate is found in sub-oceanic sediments and in continental slope sediments, where pressure and temperature conditions combine to make it stable. Natural gas hydrate contains highly concentrated methane, which is important both as an energy resource and as a factor in global climate change. The difficulty with recovering this source of energy is that the fuel is in solid form and is not amenable to conventional gas and oil recovery techniques.",0
"Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are thought to increase C sinks in terrestrial ecosystems. The potential of these sinks to mitigate CO2 emissions, however, may be constrained by nutrients. By using metaanalysis, we found that elevated CO2 only causes accumulation of soil C when N is added at rates well above typical atmospheric N inputs. Similarly, elevated CO2 only enhances N-2 fixation, the major natural process providing soil N input, when other nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, molybdenum, and potassium) are added. Hence, soil C sequestration under elevated CO2 is constrained both directly by IN availability and indirectly by nutrients needed to support N2 fixation.",0
"Flood/drought series during the past 1000 yrs in the Yangtze Delta, China, was reconstructed based on historical documents and local chronologies. Continuous wavelet transform was applied to detect the periodicity and variability of the flood/drought series. Research results indicate that: (1) Larger fluctuations of climatic changes in the Tibetan Plateau result in higher wavelet variance of flood/drought in the Yangtze Delta, for example, during 1400-1700, the proxy indicators indicate that the annual temperature in Tibet experienced larger variability and that this time interval exactly corresponds to the time when the higher and significant wavelet variance occurred; (2) Periods featured by colder temperature in the Tibetan Plateau usually correspond to periods characterized by higher wetness with higher probability of flood events; (3) Variability of heating features of the Tibetan Plateau exerted great influences on intensity and onset of Indian monsoon and south Asian summer monsoon, and these atmospheric activities are in direct connection with precipitation in Eastern China. Current global warming may alter the snow mass of Tibetan Plateau and then alters the heating features of Tibetan Plateau, which may in turn impact flood/drought conditions in the Yangtze Delta.

"HFC-134a has been used as a zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) alternative for HCFC-141b in polyurethane foam applications. Between two major categories of zero ODP alternatives, hydrocarbons and HFCs, HFC-134a offers some advantages. It is nonflammable, widely available, and it is less expensive than other HFCs. It is an ideal choice for foam applications where nonflammability, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and blowing agent costs are major issues. Yet, HFC-134a suffers from one significant drawback - it has limited solubility in polyurethane raw materials, such as polyols. Although the issue can be alleviated by careful selection of polyols and use of coblowing agents, such as water, there is a need to further improve the system. trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene (TDCE) is a liquid at room temperature (b.p. 48 degrees C). It has no ozone depletion potential(1) (ODP), and it has very low global warming potential (GWT) because it has very short atmospheric lifetime. Previously, we found that the addition of TDCE in HFCs-based urethane foam formulations significantly improved the fire performance. In this study, we evaluated the effect of TDCE on the vapor pressure of several HFC-134a-polyol combinations. The results show that the presence of TDCE can reduce the vapor pressure of certain HFC-134a-polyol blends. More importantly, the presence of TDCE allows one to reduce the levels of HFC-134, significantly reducing the overall vapor pressure of HFC-134a-containing systems. Finally, the presence of TDCE can dramatically reduce the viscosity of HFC-134a-polyols blends, which is important for some applications.",0
"Duplicates of a domesticated (H-line) and a naturalised line (S-line) of Oncorhynchus mykiss were examined for growth performance and tolerance to acute exposure to water temperature of 27 degreesC. After 516 days from hatch, fish from the H-line were, on average, 11% longer and 24% heavier than fish from the S-line. Fish from the H-line also displayed lower coefficients of variation in length and weight than fish from the S-line. H-line fish had a significantly greater tolerance to water temperature of 27 degreesC than S-line fish and significant logistic models were developed for each line. LT50's of H-line fish were approximately double the LT50's of S-line fish. Length or weight within a line was not significantly correlated with survival time at 27 degreesC. The results indicated that the H-line of O. mykiss is well adapted to the relatively hot summer conditions of Western Australia and that directed selection for faster growth has been effective in selecting for increasing heat tolerance within this line. The implications for establishing an even more heat-tolerant line of O. mykiss are discussed in relation to global warming. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Statistical characteristic of daily temperature series (1954-2004) of Xiamen station is analyzed by using Gaussian and skew distribution functions, and then the future probable trend of record temperature events (RBTE) is also simulated by using Monte-Carlo(MC) methods based on the Gaussian and skew distribution functions, respectively. Results show that the statistical property of nearly 50a daily observation temperature data in June of Xiamen station is more consistent with that obtained from the skew function. However, the theoretical study shows that the skew function and Gaussian function have the same limit of convergence, i. e. the Gumbel distribution function. The results also show that the MC simulation based on the skew distribution with global warming background can reveal the future probable extreme events well, and the Xiamen 's daily temperature distribution of June in the next 10 a is predicted. The global warming background can lead the occurrence probabilities of high-temperature record-breaking event and the average daily temperature to increase. In addition, based on the observed date in China, the spatial temperature distribution of the occurrence with the max probability over China in coming 10 years is also presented.",0

"Predictions of species invasions are often made using information from their native ranges. Acquisition of native-range information can be very costly and time-consuming and in some cases may not reflect conditions in the invaded range. Using information from the invaded range can enable much faster modeling at finer geographic resolutions than using information from a species' native range. We used confirmed presence points from the native range, southern Africa, and the invaded range, the southwestern United States, to predict the potential distribution of the perennial bunchgrass Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees, (Lehmann lovegrass), in its invaded range in the United States. The two models showed strong agreement for the area encompassed by the presence points in the invaded range, and offered insight into the overlapping but slightly different ecological niche occupied by the introduced grass in the invaded range. Regions outside of the scope of inference showed less agreement between the two models. E. lehmanniana was selected via seeding trials before being planted in the United States and therefore represents an isolated genotype from the native-range population. Models built using confirmed presence points from the invaded range can provide insight into how the selected genotype is expressed on the landscape and considers influences not present in the native range. Models created from locations in both the invaded and native ranges can lead to a more complete understanding of an introduced species' potential for spread, especially in the case of anthropogenic selection.

"In view of the potential consequences of the greenhouse effect, it is important to restrain consumption of fossil fuels by exploiting conservation, solar power, and nuclear power. The pressure on developing countries for increased energy consumption makes reduction of fossil fuel use in the industrialized countries all the more important. Nuclear power already has had a significant impact. Primarily through its use, France reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 24% from 1973 to 1986. Given a vigorous program of nuclear power development, electrification, and conservation, one can envisage a U.S. energy economy in which CO2 production is halved. Standardized reactors, of small or medium size, may enhance the prospects for a nuclear renaissance in industrialized countries, and may be well matched to the needs of developing countries.",0
"Global average sea surface temperature (SST) from 40 degreesS to 60 degreesN fluctuates +/-0.3 degreesC on interannual period scales, with global warming (cooling) during El Nino (La Nina). About 90% of the global warming during El Nino occurs in the tropical global ocean from 20 degreesS to 20 degreesN, half because of large SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific associated with El Nino and the other half because of warm SST anomalies occurring over similar to 80% of the tropical global ocean. From examination of National Centers for Environmental Prediction [Kalnay et al., 1996] and Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set [Woodruff et al., 1993] reanalyses, tropical global warming during El Nino is associated with higher troposphere moisture content and cloud cover, with reduced trade wind intensity occurring during the onset phase of EI Nino. During this onset phase the tropical global average diabatic heat storage tendency in the layer above the main pycnocline is 1-3 Wm(-2) above normal. Its principal source is a reduction in the poleward Ekman heat flux out of the tropical ocean of 2-5 Wm(-2). Subsequently, peak tropical global warming during El Nino is dissipated by an increase in the flux of latent heat to the troposphere of 2-5 W m(-2), with reduced shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes in response to increased cloud cover tending to cancel each other. In the extratropical global ocean the reduction in poleward Ekman heat flux out of the tropics during the onset of El Nino tends to be balanced by reduction in the flux of latent heat to the troposphere. Thus global warming and cooling during Earth's internal mode of interannual climate variability arise from fluctuations in the global hydrological balance, not the global radiation balance. Since it occurs in the absence of extraterrestrial and anthropogenic forcing, global warming on decadal, interdecadal, and centennial period scales may also occur in association with Earth's internal modes of climate variability on those scales.",0
"In late summer 2005 a mass coral bleaching event occurred in the Caribbean. Here we quantify coral bleaching in Barbados at six sites on the island's sheltered west and exposed southwest coasts, including nearshore fringing and patch reefs and offshore bank reef habitats. Onset of coral bleaching occurred in late August 2005 and persisted for many months after temperatures cooled. All reef habitats and virtually all coral taxa were affected, with an average of 70.6% of all colonies bleaching. Nearshore reefs (< 10 m depth) were affected more severely than offshore deeper reefs (> 15 m) with an average of 80.6% of all coral colonies bleaching compared with 60.5% on the latter. Inter-species variation in susceptibility to bleaching was marked with > 90% of colonies bleaching in some species whilst < 10% bleached in others. Follow-up surveys revealed low coral mortality, with an overall mean of 3.8% partial colony death across all species and reefs by February 2006. However, bleached condition has persisted with a mean of 37.7% of all coral colonies still bleached after 5 1/2 months, indicating that loss of live coral is likely to continue for some time. This event represents the most severe bleaching episode ever witnessed on Barbados' reefs and emphasises the vulnerability of small island states, with a high reliance on healthy coral reef ecosystem services, to elevated sea water temperatures associated with climate variability and global climate change.",0
"We investigated the effect of organic matter and weathering on the lability and solid phase speciation of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) in two contrasting subalpine regions in the Italian Alps. Cr, Ni and Cu could be linked to weathering. This was not the case for Pb. Since organic matter (OM) influences the solid phase speciation of heavy metals, the total organic C and N content, the C and N content of different density fractions of OM and also of the labile (oxidised by H(2)O(2)) and stable (H(2)O(2)-resistant) fractions were determined. Soil OM stocks were high and soils on north-facing slopes had more OM than the south-facing sites to which they were paired. Density measurements and the H(2)O(2) fractionation indicated that the higher OM content on north-facing sites was due to an accumulation of weakly degraded organic material. Due to higher weathering intensity on north-facing sites, the abundance of the EDTA-extractable heavy metals was higher than on south-facing sites. All EDTA-extractable heavy metals showed a good correlation to the water-soluble phenolic concentrations which indicates that the metals were probably translocated as metal-organic complexes. Pb and Cu correlate not only to the light (density <1 g/cm(3)) and labile, organic fraction but also to the heavy (density>2 g/cm(3)) and stable fraction. High-mountain ecosystems like the Alps are sensitive to changing environmental conditions such as global warming. A warmer climate and the more favourable conditions it brings for biological activity, especially at cooler sites, will probably lead in the short-to mid-term to an increased loss of accumulated, weakly degraded OM. As the Pb and Cu content is significantly related to the labile organic matter pools, the risk exists that an increase in OM mineralisation could affect the storage capacity and mobility of these metals in soils.

"The high-arctic environment is an environment where the consequences of global warming may be significant. In this paper we report on findings on carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes above a sedge-dominated fen at Zackenberg (74 degrees 28'N, 20 degrees 34' W) in The National Park of North and East Greenland. Eddy covariance measurements were initiated at the start of the growing season and terminated shortly before its end lasting 45 days. The net CO2 nux during daytime reaches a high of 10 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), and around the summer solstice, net CO2 assimilation occurred at midnight, resulting in net carbon gain during the night. The measured carbon dioxide fluxes compare well to estimates based on the photosynthesis model by Collatz et al. (1991). The total growing-season net ecosystem CO2 exchange was estimated to be 96 g cm(-2) based on the carbon dioxide model and micrometeorological data. Finally, the combined CO2 assimilation and soil respiration models are used for examining the dependence of the carbon dioxide budget on temperature. The ecosystem is found to function optimally given the present temperature conditions whereas either an increase or a decrease in temperature would reduce the ecosystem CO2 accumulation. An increase in temperature by 5 degrees C would turn the ecosystem into a carbon dioxide source.",0
"There are three hypothesized controls on food-chain length (FCL): energy supply (or ""resource availability""), ecosystem size and disturbance (or ""environmental variation""). In this article, the evidence for controls on FCL in freshwater ecosystems is evaluated. First, the various ways FCL can be measured are defined. Food-chain length typically is estimated as (1) connectance-based FCL-an average connectance between basal resources and top consumers, (2) functional FCL-by experimental determination of functionally significant effects of a top predator on lower trophic-level biomass patterns, and (3) realized FCL-an average connectance measure weighted by energy flow between basal consumers and the consumer occupying the maximum trophic position in the food web. Second, all evidence for relationships between the three hypothetical controls and FCL in freshwater ecosystems are evaluated. The review includes studies from streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, phytotelmata, and experimental containers. Surprisingly, few studies of FCL in freshwaters that test the same suite of controls using the same methods are found. Equally compelling results arise from case studies based on functional, realized, and connectance-based measures of FCL. Third, 10 rules of thumb that could increase similarity of future studies, thereby facilitating synthesis across systems, are suggested. Fourth, it is discussed how FCL influences the concentration of contaminants in large-bodied animals (many of which are consumed by humans) as well as the efficacy of biocontrol applications in agriculture. Finally, there is a discussion of the potential relationships between global climate change, hydrology, and FCL in freshwaters.",0
"An increase in photosynthetic activity of the northern hemisphere terrestrial vegetation, as derived from satellite observations, has been reported in previous studies. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of the annually detrended atmospheric CO2 in the northern hemisphere (an indicator of biospheric activity) also increased during that period. We found, by analyzing the annually detrended CO2 record by season, that early summer (June) CO2 concentrations indeed decreased from 1985 to 1991, and they have continued to decrease from 1994 up to 2002. This decrease indicates accelerating springtime net CO2 uptake. However, the CO2 minimum concentration in late summer (an indicator of net growing-season uptake) showed no positive trend since 1994, indicating that lower net CO2 uptake during summer cancelled out the enhanced uptake during spring. Using a recent satellite normalized difference vegetation index data set and climate data, we show that this lower summer uptake is probably the result of hotter and drier summers in both mid and high latitudes, demonstrating that a warming climate does not necessarily lead to higher CO2 growing-season uptake, even in high-latitude ecosystems that are considered to be temperature limited.",0
"Insights into the effects of climatic changes on primary metabolism in plants will enhance our understanding of ecosystem response to global climate change. In a greenhouse experiment, we studied the impact of total annual rainfall, intermittent wet and dry periods, and increased soil and air temperature (+3 degrees C) on an annual C(3) grass, Avena barbata, dominant in many California and Mediterranean grasslands. In order to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant response, analyses were carried out at scales ranging from the leaf (gene expression and enzyme activity) to the whole plant (biomass and phenology). Plant gene expression was more responsive to short-term changes in water availability (wet vs. dry periods) than to differences in cumulative rainfall. The effect of elevated temperature depended on total rainfall: flowering started earlier in high vs. low temperature under high rainfall, but not under low rainfall. Gene expression indicative of advanced development could be measured in leaves several weeks before flowering, linking gene expression to the phenological impact of altered climate. Given these responses of a dominant annual grass to manipulation of rain and temperature, we suggest that the impact of increased temperature on California annual grasslands will vary between wet and dry years. In wet years, biomass production will increase and flowering will occur earlier compared with dry years. Leaf transcript abundance analyses provided insights into the mechanisms of plant response to warming and altered precipitation patterns.",0
"The Russian treeline is a dynamic ecotone typified by steep gradients in summer temperature and regionally variable gradients in albedo and heat flux. The location of the treeline is largely controlled by summer temperatures and growing season length. Temperatures have responded strongly to twentieth-century global warming and will display a magnified response to future warming. Dendroecological studies indicate enhanced conifer recruitment during the twentieth century. However, conifers have not yet recolonized many areas where trees were present during the Medieval Warm period (ca AD 800-1300) or the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; ca 10 000-3000 years ago). Reconstruction of tree distributions during the HTM suggests that the future position of the treeline due to global warming may approximate its former Holocene maximum position. An increased dominance of evergreen tree species in the northern Siberian forests may be an important difference between past and future conditions. Based on the slow rates of treeline expansion observed during the twentieth century, the presence of steep climatic gradients associated with the current Arctic coastline and the prevalence of organic soils, it is possible that rates of treeline expansion will be regionally variable and transient forest communities with species abundances different from today's may develop.",0
"We can precisely predict the future dynamics of populations only if we know the underlying mechanism of population dynamics. Long-term data are important for the elucidation of such mechanisms. In this article we analyze the 50-year dynamics of annual light-trap catches of three insect pest species living in paddy fields in Japan: the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae); the green rice leafhopper, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Deltocephalidae); and the small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus (Fallen) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). We separate the long-term dynamics into two components by using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing: (1) the underlying dynamics of populations, and (2) the influence of the past changes in the environment. The former component is analyzed by response surface analysis and vector autoregression to evaluate the nonlinearity of density-dependence and the inter-specific influence of density, respectively. On the basis of these analyses, we perform the state-space model analyses. The state-space model selected by Akaike's information criterion indicates that the observed number of light-trap catches of C. suppressalis and N. cincticeps in summer increases with increasing temperatures in the previous winter. It also indicates that the influence of temperature is not carried over to the next year. We utilize the selected model to predict the impact of global warming on these species, by substituting the temperature predicted by a general circulation model.",0
"The purpose of this study is to document and assess the environmental impacts associated with two competing powder coating solutions using current life cycle assessment (LCA) methods and available data and to check whether there is a conflict between environmental performance and occupational health issues. Data have been gathered for the manufacture and application of the two different powder coatings. The case study is a cradle-to-gate study, using retrospective data. The data were entered into the SimaPro 7.2.4 LCA software and environmental impacts calculated using IPPC 2007, CML-IA and USEtox (TM) classification and characterisation methods. The USEtox methods were used both with and without interim factors, and this distinction was very important for the ranking of the alternatives. The study was performed using the functional unit: Surface treatment of the ""foot-cross"" of one H05 5300 office chair for 15 years (the lifetime of the chair), where the reference flow was 172 g of powder coating to fulfil this function. Literature about the known health effects associated with chemicals in the two solutions was also consulted in order to assess whether the main concerns driving the desire to replace the epoxy-based powder coating have been addressed and improved through using the polyester-based alternative. The life cycle environmental impacts evaluated show improvements in the potential environmental impacts analysed due to the substitute polyester-based coating. The results for human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity potentials are dependent on the inclusion of interim characterisation factors. Literature sources provide evidence of irritation and sensitisation effects associated with epoxy resin, but not for the polyester resin alternative. Substitution of the epoxy-based coating by a polyester-based alternative reduces the occupational health risk for workers coming into contact with the powder coating. The results show that this substitution has also led to reduced potential environmental impacts: global warming, ozone depletion, photochemical oxidant creation, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity, when the interim factors for some metals and organics are included in the USEtox calculations.",0
"Aims The aims were (1) to assess the species richness and structure of phytophagous Hemiptera communities along a latitudinal gradient, (2) to identify the importance of rare species in structuring these patterns, and (3) to hypothesize about how phytophagous Hemiptera communities may respond to future climate change. Location East coast of Australia. Methods Four latitudes within the 1150 km coastal distribution of Acacia falcata were selected. The insect assemblage on the host plant Acacia falcata was sampled seasonally over two years. Congeneric plant species were also sampled at the sites. Results Ninety-eight species of phytophagous Hemiptera were collected from A. falcata. Total species richness was significantly lower at the most temperate latitude compared to the three more tropical latitudes. We classified species into four climate change response groups depending on their latitudinal range and apparent host specificity. Pairwise comparisons between groups showed that the cosmopolitan, generalist feeders and specialists had a similar community structure to each other, but the climate generalists had a significantly different structure. Fifty-seven species were identified as rare. Most of these rare species were phloem hoppers and their removal from the dataset led to changes in the proportional representation of all guilds in two groups: the specialist and generalist feeders. Main conclusions We found no directional increase in phytophagous Hemiptera species richness. This indicates that, at least in the short term, species richness patterns of these communities may be similar to that found today. As the climate continues to change, however, we might expect some increases in species richness at the more temperate latitudes as species migrate in response to shifting climate zones. In the longer term, more substantial changes in community composition will be expected because the rare species, which comprise a large fraction of these communities, will be vulnerable to both direct climatic changes, and indirect effects via changes to their host's distribution.",0
"Limitations in available techniques to separate autotrophic (root) and soil heterotrophic respiration have hampered the understanding of forest C cycling. The former is here defined as respiration by roots, their associated mycorrhizal fungi and other micro-organisms in the rhizosphere directly dependent on labile C compounds leaked from roots. In order to separate the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration, all Scots pine trees in 900 m(2) plots were girdled to instantaneously terminate the supply of current photosynthates from the tree canopy to roots. Hogberg et al. (Nature 411, 789-792, 2001) reported that autotrophic activity contributed up to 56% of total soil respiration during the first summer of this experiment. They also found that mobilization of stored starch (and likely also sugars) in roots after girdling caused an increased apparent heterotrophic respiration on girdled plots. Herein a transient increase in the delta(13)C Of Soil CO(2) efflux after girdling, thought to be due to decomposition of (13)C-enriched ectomycorrhizal mycelium and root starch and sugar reserves, is reported. In the second year after girdling, when starch reserves of girdled tree roots were exhausted, calculated root respiration increased up to 65% of total soil CO(2) efflux. It is suggested that this estimate of its contribution to soil respiration is more precise than the previous based on one year of observation. Heterotrophic respiration declined in response to a 20-day-long 6 degreesC decline in soil temperature during the second summer, whereas root respiration did not decline. This did not support the idea that root respiration should be more sensitive to variations in soil temperature. It is suggested that above-ground photosynthetic activity and allocation patterns of recent photosynthates to roots should be considered in models of responses of forest C balances to global climate change.",0
"Design process determines 80% of the whole environmental impact generated by a product or service. This paper intends to describe a simplified renewed procedure for the analysis and selection of materials capable of providing fast and reliable information to those designers that are interested to minimize the life-cycle environmental burden of products and services, the so called EcoAudit. The here presented EcoAudit procedure assesses the burden associated to a component/product by means of a customized set of environmental impact indicators, without exploring all parameters that are usually provided by a LCA study. The set of environmental impact indicators that are here adopted for this purpose are the energy consumption (energy breakdown in terms of direct and indirect contributors, MJ per functional unit), the global warming potential (in terms of CO2 equiv per functional unit) and the end of life possibilities (in terms of effective practicable scenarios, i.e. of recycling). The first two indicators may be intended as ""key environmental performance indicators"" (""KEPIs""). This approach allows a fast preliminary ranking of materials and processes identifying the most relevant critical phases of a system, making the ecodesign process really starting. The integration within the Cambridge Engineering Selector 2009 EcoAudit tool allows to search and browse materials data, calculating the environmental load in a real time.

" Simulated future summers (i.e., 2049-2051) and annual (i.e., 2050) average regional O-3 and PM2.5 concentrations over the United States are compared with historic ( i.e., 2000-2002 summers and all of 2001) levels to investigate the potential impacts of global climate change and emissions on regional air quality. Meteorological inputs to the CMAQ chemical transport model are developed by downscaling the GISS Global Climate Model simulations using an MM5-based regional climate model. Future-year emissions for North America are developed by growing the U. S. EPA CAIR inventory, Mexican and Canadian emissions and by using the IMAGE model with the IPCC A1B emissions scenario that is also used in projecting future climate. Reductions of more than 50% in NOX and SO2 emissions are forecast. Impacts of global climate change alone on regional air quality are small compared to impacts from emission control-related reductions, although increases in pollutant concentrations due to stagnation and other factors are found. The combined effect of climate change and emission reductions lead to a 20% decrease (regionally varying from -11% to -28%) in the mean summer maximum daily 8-hour ozone levels (M8hO(3)) over the United States. Mean annual PM2.5 concentrations are estimated to be 23% lower (varies from -9% to -32%). Major reductions in sulfate, nitrate and ammonium PM2.5 components combined with the limited reduction in organic carbon suggests that organic carbon will be the dominant component of PM2.5 mass in the future. Regionally, the eastern United States benefits more than the rest of the regions from reductions in both M8hO(3) and PM2.5, because of both spatial variations in the meteorological and emissions changes. Reduction in the higher M8hO(3) concentrations is also estimated for all subregions and fewer days with M8hO(3) above the air quality standards in urban sites with Atlanta in the southeast benefiting most.",0
"Changes in precipitation in the Amazon Basin resulting from regional deforestation, global warming, and El Nino events may affect emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitric oxide (NO) from soils. Changes in soil emissions of radiatively important gases could have feedback implications for regional and global climate. Here, we report the final results of a 5-year, large-scale (1 ha) throughfall exclusion experiment, followed by 1 year of recovery with natural throughfall, conducted in a mature evergreen forest near Santarem, Brazil. The exclusion manipulation lowered annual N2O emissions in four out of five treatment years (a natural drought year being the exception), and then recovered during the first year after the drought treatment stopped. Similarly, consumption of atmospheric CH4 increased under drought treatment, except during a natural drought year, and it also recovered to pretreatment values during the first year that natural throughfall was permitted back on the plot. No treatment effect was detected for NO emissions during the first 3 treatment years, but NO emissions increased in the fourth year under the extremely dry conditions of the exclusion plot during a natural drought. Surprisingly, there was no treatment effect on soil CO2 efflux in any year. The drought treatment provoked significant tree mortality and reduced the allocation of C to stems, but allocation of C to foliage and roots were less affected. Taken together, these results suggest that the dominant effect of throughfall exclusion on soil processes during this 6-year period was on soil aeration conditions that transiently affected CH4, N2O, and NO production and consumption.",0
"A 3-step perturbation ratio method is designed to facilitate the separation of seasonal pattern shifts of inflow to reservoirs from 2 other climate change factors: annual inflow change and sea level rise. The modeled region provides source water for the State Water Project and Central Valley Project of California. Four groups of the water planning simulation model CALSIM II run are implemented to isolate individual impacts of seasonal pattern shift of inflow to reservoirs, annual inflow volume change, and sea level rise on water supply in this region. Estimates of climate change impacts on water supply are made for the middle and end of the 21st century. These impacts are in terms of the ensemble means of CALSIM II simulation results for each of 12 climate model projections under the A2 or B1 emission scenario. The results indicate that around the middle of this century annual inflow changes contribute most to climate change impacts on water supply. But near the end of the century sea level rise of 61 cm in San Francisco Bay plays a major role in affecting water supplies. Published by Elsevier B.V.",0
"The production of cercariae from their snail host is a fundamental component of transmission success in trematodes. The emergence of Echinoparyphium recurvatum (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) cercariae from Lymnaea peregra was studied under natural sunlight conditions, using naturally infected snails of different sizes (10-17 mm) within a temperature range of 10-29 degrees C. There was a single photoperiodic circadian cycle of emergence with one peak, which correlated with the maximum diffuse sunlight irradiation. At 21 degrees C the daily number of emerging cercariae increased with increasing host snail size, but variations in cercarial emergence did occur between both individual snails and different days. There was only limited evidence of cyclic emergence patterns over a 3-week period, probably due to extensive snail mortality, particularly those in the larger size classes. Very few cercariae emerged in all snail size classes at the lowest temperature studied (10 degrees C), but at increasingly higher temperatures elevated numbers of cercariae emerged, reaching an optimum between 17 and 25 degrees C. Above this range emergence was reduced. At all temperatures more cercariae emerged from larger snails. Analysis of emergence using the Q(10) value, a measure of physiological processes over temperature ranges, showed that between 10 and 21 degrees C (approximate to 15 degrees C) Q(10) values exceeded 100 for all snail size classes, indicating a substantially greater emergence than would be expected for normal physiological rates. From 14 to 25 degrees C (approximate to 20 degrees C) cercarial emergence in most snail size classes showed little change in Q(10), although in the smallest size class emergence was still substantially greater than the typical Q(10) increase expected over this temperature range. At the highest range of 21-29 degrees C (approximate to 25 degrees C), Q(10) was much reduced. The importance of these results for cercarial emergence under global climate change is discussed.",0
"The effect of gradually increased water temperature on the metabolism of temperate eelpout from the North Sea (Zoarces viviparus) and Antarctic eelpout (Pachycara brachycephalum) was investigated. Standard metabolic rate (SMR) was similar in cold-adapted P, brachycephalum and cold-acclimated Z, viviparus in the low temperature range. This indicates that Antarctic eelpout show no metabolic cold adaptation las originally defined by Wohlschlag); however, they do show a compensatory increase of oxygen consumption compared to warm-acclimated eelpout, SMR increased more strongly with rising temperature in P, brachycephalum than in Z, viviparus, which is reflected in a higher Arrhenius activation energy for oxygen consumption (99+/-5 kJ mol(-1), versus 55+/-3 kJ mol(-1) for cold-acclimated Z, viviparus; means +/- S,D,), The intracellular pH in the white musculature of Z, viviparus follows alphastat regulation over the whole investigated temperature range and dropped at a rate of -0.016 pH units per degrees C between 3 degrees C and 24 degrees C. In Antarctic eelpout white muscle pH declined at a rate of -0.015 pH units per degrees C between 0 degrees C and 3 degrees C, but deviated from alphastat at higher temperatures, indicating that thermal stress leads to acid-base disturbances in this species. The upper critical temperature limit (Tc(II); characterised by a transition to anaerobic metabolism) was found to be between 21 degrees C and 24 degrees C for Z, viviparus and around 9 degrees C for P, brachycephalum, In both species a rise of succinate concentration in the liver tissue turned out to be the most useful indicator of Tc(II), Obviously, liver is more sensitive to heat stress than is white muscle, Accordingly, the energy status of white muscle is not diminished at Tc(II), Heat-induced hyperglycaemia was observed in Antarctic eelpout (at 9 degrees C and 10 degrees C), but not in common eelpout, Based on our results and on literature data, impaired respiration in combination with circulatory failure is suggested as the final cause of heat death. Our data suggest that the southern distribution limit of Zoarces viviparus is correlated with the limit of thermal tolerance. Therefore, it can be anticipated that global warming would cause a shift in the distribution of this species.",0
"Understanding the environmental burdens from residential construction is increasingly important as consumers become more aware of the impacts of their purchasing decisions. In 2004, The Consortium for Research on Renewable Industrial Materials (CORRIM) evaluated the life-cycle environmental impacts of building materials used in residential construction. This report builds upon those findings by examining the environmental burdens of each component used to construct wall and floor subassemblies in residential homes. Evaluating components and subassemblies illuminates how the environmental burdens from different products, designs, and processes compare. Summary performance measures were developed for fossil fuel energy requirements, global warming potential, air and water pollution, and solid waste. This study clearly shows that the use of wood-based building materials significantly reduces most environmental burdens. The study also demonstrates the benefits of biofuels, recycling, and pre-cutting to reduce solid waste. This study's significance is enhanced by the detailed insights it provides on how architects and product and process engineers can substantially reduce environmental burdens.",0
"Global patterns of biodiversity and comparisons between tropical and temperate ecosystems have pervaded ecology from its inception. However, the urgency in understanding these global patterns has been accentuated by the threat of rapid climate change. We apply an adaptive model of environmental tolerance evolution to global climate data and climate change model projections to examine the relative impacts of climate change on different regions of the globe. Our results project more adverse impacts of warming on tropical populations due to environmental tolerance adaptation to conditions of low interannual variability in temperature. When applied to present variability and future forecasts of precipitation data, the tolerance adaptation model found large reductions in fitness predicted for populations in high-latitude northern hemisphere regions, although some tropical regions had comparable reductions in fitness. We formulated an evolutionary regional climate change index (ERCCI) to additionally incorporate the predicted changes in the interannual variability of temperature and precipitation. Based on this index, we suggest that the magnitude of climate change impacts could be much more heterogeneous across latitude than previously thought. Specifically, tropical regions are likely to be just as affected as temperate regions and, in some regions under some circumstances, possibly more so.",0
"The magnitude of the Sun's influence on climate has been a subject of intense debate. Estimates of this magnitude are generally based on assumptions regarding the forcing due to solar irradiance variations entering climate modelling. Given the complexity of the climate system, however, such modelling is perforce based on simplifying assumptions, which leaves it open to criticism. We take a complementary approach. We assume that the Sun has been responsible for climate change prior to 1970 and that their interrelation remained unchanged afterwards. Then, employing reconstructions and measured records of relevant solar quantities as well as of the cosmic-ray flux, we estimate statistically which fraction of the dramatic temperature rise after that date could be due to the influence of the Sun. We show that at least in the most recent past (since about 1970) the solar influence on climate cannot have been significant. (C) 2004 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Lid. All rights reserved.",0
"Given increasing concern over global climate change and national security there is a burgeoning interest in examining the relationship between economic growth and energy use in developed and developing countries. More specifically, decoupling energy use per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) has fast come to be seen as in the interests of national economies and the world as a whole. Recent attention has been paid to the dramatic decreases in the energy intensity of the Chinese economy, which fell by 55% between 1975 and 1995. Do other developing economies follow similar trajectories? This paper examines the energy intensity of the Mexican economy for the period 1988-1998. Although the long-term trend in Mexican energy intensity is rising, the energy intensity of the Mexican economy began to decline in 1988. This paper explores the factors that have contributed to this reduction. Diminishing Mexican energy use per unit of GDP has been driven by significant decreases in industrial energy intensity. We show that these changes have resulted from changes in the composition of Mexican industrial structure and technological change. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"A model of product and land markets in U.S. forest and agricultural sectors is used to examine the private forest management, land use, and market implications of carbon sequestration policies implemented in a ""least social cost"" fashion. Results suggest: policy-induced land use changes may generate compensating land use shifts through markets; land use shifts to meet policy targets need not be permanent; implementation of land use and management changes in a smooth or regular fashion over time may not be optimal; land use changes account for the largest part of adjustments to meet policy targets; and forest management changes involve higher intensity and less forest type conversion.",0
"Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and the related Principal Components (PC) analysis are used to extract valuable vegetation cover derived information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR)'s Leaf Area Index (LAI) satellite images. Results suggest that from 1982 to 2000 global climate change has contributed to an increase in vegetation cover in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The correlation between rainfall and LAI EOF PC1 and PC2 indicates that rainfall is the major climatic factor influencing interannual variations of average vegetation cover throughout the entire Plateau. However, annual mean vegetation cover trends in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are mainly out of phase with air temperature increasing, which is primarily responsible for nonsynchronous changes of vegetation cover. In the southern ridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, recent warming trends contribute to humid weather and favorable conditions for vegetation growth. By contrast, higher temperatures have led to arid conditions and insufficient rainfall in the northern part of the Plateau, leading to drought and other climatic conditions which are not conducive to increased vegetation cover.",0
"With growing concerns about global environmental and increased focus on population health is renewed interest in transportation sector. The challenge is to find and develop cost effective ways to improve urban air quality without scarifying economy. The natural gas, as fuel, constitutes an alternative to the traditional fuels because its impact on the reduction of the global warming impact is consequent compared to the traditional fuels such as gasoline. This study deals with a study of NGV's catalysts. Natural gas vehicles' catalysts were characterized by XPS, STEM in order to determine the various active phases. The results of characterization showed that the palladium oxidized Pd(2+) was the principal active site. The experimental runs were carried out close to the real operating conditions using a sample of monolith. Numerous reactions were identified, such as NO reduction by hydrogen, carbon monoxide at low temperature and methane at high temperature. Moreover, methane reforming and water-gas shift were clearly found on commercial system. The influence of each reaction on the kinetics behaviour of the whole mixture makes difficult to uncouple the different reactions of oxidations and reductions, because the rate of these reactions was highly dependant on the reactant present in the automobile exhaust gases as well as their relative concentration. To identify each involved reaction in NGV TWC process, we remove alternatively reducing agents or oxidizing agents. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Prior research on tree line dynamics has primarily been based on field inventory data, and little is known about the potential for using remotely sensed imagery to detect change. The present study developed a new methodology by combining remote sensing and field survey data to examine dynamics of the pristine forest in the tree line area on Changbai Mountain in Northeast China over the past two decades. The new method normalized remote sensing data by using the adjacent old-growth coniferous forest (close to climax) below the tree line as the reference (assuming steady state) to eliminate various potential errors associated with different satellite sensors, atmospheric conditions and seasonal vegetation changes. Specifically, we used a ratio of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) between the tree line forest (birch) and the referenced old-growth coniferous forest, as well as a ratio between the interface forest against the referenced coniferous forest, to investigate growth dynamics of the tree line forest from 1977 to 1999. The interface forest is distributed between the tree line forest and non-forest zone. Compared with traditional methods using remote sensing data, the new method has higher sensitivity to tree line dynamics. We found that the tree line delineated from satellite imagery had shown no shift in the past decades. However, the NDVI ratio of tree line forest against the reference forest increased from 0.9 to 2 from 1977 to 1999, and the ratio of interface forest against the reference forest increased from 0.83 to 0.98, indicating that growth of the tree line forest apparently exceeded that of the reference coniferous forest and had grown denser. Field surveys also supported the conclusion from remote sensing results that the tree line forest on Changbai Mountain has grown denser in the past decades. From 1980 to 2002, basal area of the tree line forest increased 35% (from 18.8 to 25.3m2ha-1); at the same time the NDVI ratio increased about 33%. This study suggests that it is possible to monitor growth of the tree line forest based on multi-temporal remote sensing images. We speculate that global warming may have contributed to the observed rapid growth of the tree line forest because temperature is a major limiting factor among climatic variables in the tree line forest and effect from other factors, such as fire, harvesting and snow and wind damage, were not evident in this protected area in the past decades.",0
"When all of the greenhouse gases are expressed in CO2 equivalents, we find that over the past 100 years, equivalent CO2 values have increased by 40%. Over this period, the temperature of the planet appears to have increased by 0.5-degrees-C, however, much of this warming may be explained by a variety of non-greenhouse factors. In addition, fully 75% of the global warming of the past century occurred before the end of the Second World War, long before most of the trace gases were added to the atmosphere. Furthermore, the celebrated warming of the 1980s and early 1990s is seriously challenged by recent satellite-based global temperature measurements that show essentially no warming at all. In an effort to explain these findings, climate scientists are pointing to the cooling effects of human-induced increases in atmospheric SO2. The bottom line is simple-despite a public perspective to the contrary, the global temperature record provides little support for the catastrophic view of the greenhouse effect.",0
"A series of climate model simulations of the 20th Century are analysed to investigate a number of published correlations between indices of local economic activity and recent global warming. These correlations have been used to support a hypothesis that the observed surface warming record has been contaminated in some way and thus overestimates true global warming. However, the basis of the results are correlations over a very restricted set of locations (predominantly western Europe, Japan and the USA) which project strongly onto naturally occurring patterns of climate variability, or are with fields with significant amounts of spatial auto-correlation. Across model simulations, the correlations vary widely due to the chaotic weather component in any short-term record. The reported correlations do not fall outside the simulated distribution, and are probably spurious (i.e. are likely to have arisen from chance alone). Thus, though this study cannot prove that the global temperature record is unbiased, there is no compelling evidence from these correlations of any large-scale contamination.

"The southern Appalachian spruce-fir (Picea rubens Sarg. and Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir.) forest is found only on high altitude mountain tops that receive copious precipitation (>2000 mm year(-1)) and experience frequent cloud immersion. These high-elevation, temperate rain forests are immersed in clouds on similar to 65% of the total growth season days and for 30-40% of a typical summer day, and cloud deposition accounts for up to 50% of their annual water budget. We investigated environmental influences on understory leaf gas exchange and water relations at two sites: Mt. Mitchell, NC (MM; 35 degrees 45'53 '' N, 82 degrees 15'53 '' W, 2028 m elevation) and Whitetop Mtn., VA (WT; 36 degrees 38'19 '' N, 81 degrees 36'19 '' W, 1685 in elevation). We hypothesized that the cool, moist and cloudy conditions at these sites exert a strong influence on leaf gas exchange. Maximum photosynthesis (A(max)) varied between 6 and 4.0 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) for both spruce and fir and saturated at irradiances between similar to 200 and 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at both sites. Leaf conductance (g) ranged between 0.05 and 0.25 mol m(-2) s(-1) at MM and between 0.15 and 0.40 mol m(-2) s(-1) at WT and was strongly associated with leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference (LAVD). At both sites, g decreased exponentially as LAVD increased, with an 80-90% reduction in g between 0 and 0.5 kPa. Predawn leaf water potentials remained between -0.25 and -0.5 MPa for the entire summer, whereas late afternoon values declined to between -25 and -75 MPa by late summer. Thus, leaf gas exchange appeared tightly coupled to the response of g to LAVD, which maintained high water status, even at the relatively low LAVD of these cloud forests. Moreover, the cloudy, humid environment of these refugial forests appears to exert a strong influence on tree leaf gas exchange and water relations. Because global climate change is predicted to increase regional cloud ceiling levels, more research on cloud impacts on carbon gain and water relations is needed to predict future impacts on these relict forests.",0
"It is generally accepted that climate changes will have a major effect on our lives. However, buildings will also be faced with climate changes, and these changes will have an impact on indoor comfort, energy demands and the efficiency of building services, especially on those supporting free cooling and free heating. In order to predict the expected changes in a building's thermal response during its lifetime, it is necessary to look at the climate changes predicted for the future. In our study, the climate changes were considered by using simplified mathematical models combined with available test reference years to establish 'corrected test reference years'. A transient simulation tool, TRNSYS, was used to simulate the indoor climate and the useful energy demand for the heating and cooling of different buildings with different free-cooling techniques. In order to predict the expected changes in a building's thermal response, the meterological parameters for the moderate, continental climate region of Slovenia were taken into account. The study shows that during a building's lifetime, significant changes in useful energy demands can be expected-a decrease in the useful energy demand for heating of between 23 and 40% and an up-to-38-times increase in the useful energy needed for mechanical cooling. In buildings without mechanical cooling, the efficiency of the different free-cooling techniques should be increased by between 100 and 200% to ensure the same living comfort. The results presented in the study confirm that it is necessary to evaluate the consequences of global climate changes from the point to view of energy use in buildings, their contruction and the buildings' service installations.

"Phenologies of a number of anadromous fish species have been demonstrated to vary in concert with environmental factors that change with global warming, such as water and air temperatures. Anadromous fishery managers will need advice from models of phenology, or migratory timing, as functions of environmental factors in those harvest areas where annual migratory timing can vary sharply. Such models are also necessary to advise fishery managers on how and when global warming projections of the IPCC model ensemble should be factored into regulatory decisions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the annual timing of marine exit of Yukon River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at 63 degrees N 165 degrees W for 1961-2009 varied in close concert with modelled sea surface temperature, air temperature, and sea ice cover. The best linear model for 1961-2009 combines sea surface and air temperatures to explain 59% of the annual variability in migratory timing (ice cover is available only for 1970-2009). Changes in phenology of high-latitude Chinook salmon are expected in response to global warming. As average temperatures increase, the frequency of earlier migrations is expected to increase, making management of the fishery more challenging.",0
"Understanding how species in a diverse regional pool are spatially distributed with respect to habitat types is a longstanding problem in ecology. Tropical species are expected to be specialists along environmental gradients, and this should result in rapid compositional change (high beta diversity) across landscapes, particularly when alpha diversity is a small fraction of regional diversity. Corollary challenges are then to identify controlling environmental variables and to ask whether species cluster into discrete community types along a gradient. We investigated patterns of avian species' distributions in the Tilaran mountains of Costa Rica between 1000 m and 1700 m elevation where a strong moisture gradient exists. High beta diversity was found with both auditory counts adjusted for detectability and extensive capture data, revealing nearly complete change in community composition over a few kilometres on the Pacific slope. As predicted, this beta diversity was roughly twice as high as on temperate mountainsides. Partial Mantel analyses and canonical correspondence analysis indicate that change in species composition is highly correlated with change in moisture (and correlated epiphyte cover) at different distances from the continental divide on the Pacific slope. Altitude was not a good predictor of change in species composition, as species composition varies substantially among sites at the same elevation. Detrended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis revealed a zone of rapid transition separating a distinct cloud forest community from rainshadow forest. On the Caribbean slope, where a shallower moisture gradient was predicted to result in lower beta diversity, we found lower rates of compositional change and more continuous species turnover. Results suggest that habitat specialization of birds is likely a strong ecological force generating high beta diversity in montane landscapes. Despite overall rapid rates of species turnover, zones of relatively coherent composition could be identified. Landscapes with such high beta diversity are common in the tropics, although little studied. They offer high benefit/cost opportunities for conservation, particularly as climate change threatens to alter the species composition of communities of habitat specialists.",0
"Energy supply in Brazil relies heavily on renewable energy source. The production of energy from renewable sources, however, greatly depends on climatic conditions, which may be impacted in the future due to global climate change (GCC). This paper analyzes the vulnerabilities of renewable energy production in Brazil for the cases of hydropower generation and liquid biofuels production, given a set of long-term climate projections for the A2 and B2 IPCC emission scenarios. The most important result found in this study is the increasing energy vulnerability of the poorest regions of Brazil to GCC. Both biofuels production (particularly biodiesel) and electricity generation (particularly hydropower) may negatively suffer from changes in the climate of those regions. Other renewable energy sources-such as wind power generation-may also be vulnerable, raising the need for further research. However, the results found are fundamentally dependent on the climate projections which, in turn, are still highly uncertain with respect to the future evolution of greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and GCC. Therefore, in such long-term scenario analyses, the trends and directions derived are the ones to be emphasized rather than the precise results one arrives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"The present study determines how populations of Great Tits (Parus major) breeding in southern, mid and northern European latitudes have adjusted their reproductive endocrinology to differences in the ambient temperature during the gonadal cycle. A study based on long-term breeding data, using the Colwell predictability model, showed that the start of the breeding season has a high predictability (approximate to 0.8-0.9) at all latitudes, and that the environmental information factor (I(e)) progressively decreased from mid Italy (I(e)>4) to northern Finland (I(e)<1). The results indicate that integration of supplementary information, such as ambient temperature, with photoperiodic initial predictive information (day length), becomes progressively more important in maintaining the predictability of the breeding season with decreasing latitude. This hypothesis was verified by exposing photosensitive Great Tits from northern Norway, southern Sweden and northern Italy to sub-maximal photo-stimulatory day lengths (13L:11D) under two different ambient temperature regimes (+4 degrees C and +20 degrees C). Changes in testicular size, plasma levels of LH and testosterone were measured. The main results were: (1) Initial testicular growth rate, as well as LH secretion, was affected by temperature in the Italian, but not in birds from the two Scandinavian populations. (2) Maximum testicular size, maximum LH and testosterone levels were maintained for a progressively shorter period of time with increasing latitude, regardless of whether the birds were kept on a low or a high ambient temperature. (3) In birds from all latitudes, the development of photorefractoriness, as indicated by testicular regression and a decrease in plasma levels of LH and testosterone, started much earlier (with the exception for LH Great Tits from northern Scandinavia) when kept on +20 degrees C than when kept on +4 degrees C. The prolonging effects of a low temperature was more pronounced in Mediterranean birds, than in birds from Scandinavia, and more pronounced in Great Tits from southern Scandinavia than in Great Tits from northern Scandinavia. Ecological implications of the results are discussed, as well as possible impact of global warming on the breeding success of European Great Tits from different breeding latitudes.

"Small mammals appear to be less vulnerable to extinction than large species, but the underlying reasons are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that almost all (93.5%) of 61 recently extinct mammal species were homeothermic, maintaining a constant high body temperature and thus energy expenditure, which demands a high intake of food, long foraging times, and thus exposure to predators. In contrast, only 6.5% of extinct mammals were likely heterothermic and employed multi-day torpor (hibernation) or daily torpor, even though torpor is widespread within more than half of all mammalian orders. Torpor is characterized by substantial reductions of body temperature and energy expenditure and enhances survival during adverse conditions by minimizing food and water requirements, and consequently reduces foraging requirements and exposure to predators. Moreover, because life span is generally longer in heterothermic mammals than in related homeotherms, heterotherms can employ a 'sit-and-wait' strategy to withstand adverse periods and then repopulate when circumstances improve. Thus, torpor is a crucial but hitherto unappreciated attribute of small mammals for avoiding extinction. Many opportunistic heterothermic species, because of their plastic energetic requirements, may also stand a better chance of future survival than homeothermic species in the face of greater climatic extremes and changes in environmental conditions caused by global warming.",0
"Globally, peatlands account for circa 50% of terrestrial carbon storage containing as much carbon as is present in the atmosphere. The uplands of the UK have an extensive cover of blanket peat but much of it is actively eroding. This paper presents a detailed organic sediment budget for a blanket peat catchment in the north Pennines and comparative data from a catchment in the southern Pennines. The catchments have total sediment yields (organic and mineral) of 44 and 267t km(-2) a(-1) and organic sediment yields 31 and 195t km(-2) a(-1), respectively. They represent two extremes of a spectrum of eroded peat catchments. It is demonstrated that the lower sediment yields in the north Pennines are associated with extensive natural revegetation of the catchment and consequent reductions in slope-channel linkage. Construction of a carbon budget for the north Pennine catchment demonstrates that particulate carbon losses associated with the fluvial suspended sediment load are the largest single carbon loss from the system. The system is currently close to carbon neutral but much higher carbon losses associated with actively eroding systems such as the south Pennine site would make these systems a major carbon source. The possibility that enhanced summer temperatures and winter storminess will accelerate erosion of upland mires means there is a risk that physical degradation of peatlands could become a significant positive feedback on global warming. Mitigation of these potential global effects will depend on local management informed by a clear understanding of peatland sediment dynamics. The sediment budget data here suggest that in gullied peatlands revegetation of gully floors is an effective control on sediment flux so that techniques such as gully blocking are likely to be effective approaches to erosion control.

"In this study, the solar radiation data of Balikesir in Turkey are analysed to assess the techno-economic viability and environmental performance of a hybrid Photovoltaic (PV)-diesel-battery system to meet the load requirements of a typical remote farm house. Several aspects of the system are studied through the Cost of Energy (CoE), the operational hours of diesel generator, unmet load, excess electricity generation, percentage of fuel savings, etc. The CoE for this kind of hybrid system is found to be 245 US$/kWh. Simulations are performed for three cases (diesel only, PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery). It is found that a diesel-only system produces 63 900 kWh of electricity and 69.7 tonnes of CO(2), 13.0 kg of PM, 53 tonnes of NO(x) emissions per year. Using PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery systems helps reduce the emissions for CO(2) to 60 and 42.0 tonnes, for PM to 14 and 7.83 kg and for NO(x) to 34 and 0.92 tonnes, respectively. The diesel-only system is more economical if the fuel price remains below US$2/L. Otherwise, PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery systems become more cost-effective. Also, the environmental impact improvement factor is found as 0.127 and 0.399 for CO(2), 0.123 and 0.397 for PM and 0.124 and 0.398 for NO(x) for both PV-diesel and PV-diesel-battery systems, respectively.",0
"How thermodynamic factors control the climate of intense tropical cyclones (TCs) is investigated by examining the relationship between the seasonally averaged maximum potential intensity (MPI, used as a representative index of the thermodynamic forcing) over an ocean basin where TCs form and the seasonal frequency of occurrence of intense TCs. It is found that only in the Atlantic does the MPI have a statistically significant relationship with the number of intense TCs, explaining about 40 per cent of the variance. In other ocean basins, there is either no correlation or the correlation is not statistically significant. In other words, only in the Atlantic are thermodynamic factors responsible, but still only to a certain extent, for the climate variations of intense TCs. In other ocean basins, it appears that the dynamic factors are much more dominant. Such a conclusion has important implications in considering whether global warming may influence the future climate of intense TCs for the following reason. Although it has been generally accepted that the thermodynamic energy available in the atmosphere is likely to increase under global warming, the results from this study suggest that such an increase does not necessarily imply a concomitant increase in the number of intense TCs, because how the dynamic factors will vary are still not clear. Until we can demonstrate that the dynamic factors will also become more favourable for TC intensification, it remains uncertain whether the frequency of occurrence of intense TCs will increase under a global warming scenario.",0
"The equatorial Pacific atmosphere responds differently to global warming in the Gill-type and Lindzen-Nigam models. Under an assumption of no change in the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the Gill-type model, the Walker circulation is intensified in a warmer climate relative to current climatic conditions, while slightly weakened in the Lindzen-Nigam model. Furthermore, for more accurate derivation of the surface wind, the free atmosphere in the Gill-type model is combined with the atmospheric boundary layer. This modified Gill-type model actually produces weaker surface wind than the Gill-type model would, but the sensitivity of the Walker circulation to the warmer climate is similar to that obtained from the Gill-type model. These results may explain why the zonal gradient of equatorial Pacific SST during the twentieth century is observed to strengthen while the Walker circulation is not, even though they are dynamically linked.",0
"Understanding energy and material fluxes through ecosystems is central to many questions in global change biology and ecology(1-11). Ecosystem respiration is a critical component of the carbon cycle(1,5-7) and might be important in regulating biosphere response to global climate change(1-3). Here we derive a general model of ecosystem respiration based on the kinetics of metabolic reactions(11-13) and the scaling of resource use by individual organisms(14,15). The model predicts that fluxes of CO2 and energy are invariant of ecosystem biomass, but are strongly influenced by temperature, variation in cellular metabolism and rates of supply of limiting resources (water and/or nutrients). Variation in ecosystem respiration within sites, as calculated from a network of CO2 flux towers(5,7), provides robust support for the model's predictions. However, data indicate that variation in annual flux between sites is not strongly dependent on average site temperature or latitude. This presents an interesting paradox with regard to the expected temperature dependence. Nevertheless, our model provides a basis for quantitatively understanding energy and material flux between the atmosphere and biosphere.",0
"Urban areas play an outstanding role regarding to the impact assessment of Global Climate Change at the local and regional scale. Due to the high population density towns and cities exhibit an increased vulnerability towards shifting climatic conditions. To perform counteractive measures against the changing climate impacts in urban areas, detailed knowledge about urban climatic phenomena and causalities is essential. Therefore characteristic differences between urban and rural climates are outlined within the frames of the given paper. In part 1 an analysis of the urban atmospheric boundary layer structure, modifications of the urban radiation and energy balance are discussed. In addition to the characteristics of the urban heat island effect and urban air quality, the impact of built-up areas on atmospheric humidity, precipitation and fog are reviewed. In part 2 methods for illustration and evaluation of urban climatic effects, as well as tasks for meliorating the urban climate are considered. The article ends with a prospect on future changes in urban climate modifications caused by global climatic changes which are predicted by model simulations. Recommendations for mitigation of these impacts on the neighborhood are given.",0
"Despite its capital importance, the genesis of endoreic water table depressions in Western sub-Sahelian Africa is not well known yet. It is the case of the Trarza Aquifer, which is the main resource of drinkable water for Nouakchott. While water needs are growing steadily, global warming is threatening this resource. The genesis of piezometric depression is the object of this study, which analyses it in the light of the hydrochemistry of the western border of the Trarza aquifer, which is located in proximity of the Atlantic Ocean and its salt wedge. The hydrochemical facies of groundwater in the Idini pumping site, 60 km East of Nouakchott, and that of a Nouakchott to the Senegal River transect, should be categorised into 3 groups: 1) chloro-sulfated 2) sulfato-chlorinated and chloro-bicarbonated. Such facies, which are also sodocalcic, indicate that mineralization is of mixed origin (marine and continental). After reviewing the main mathematical models for piezometric depression, the present study attempts a conceptualization of the piezometric evolution of this phreatic aquifer (Continental Terminal) during the Quaternary. It highlights the dominant role of evaporation in the evolution of the water table of the Trarza aquifer, whose impact is similar to the one of the Quaternary marine level increase.

"Arctic freshwater ecosystems may be sensitive indicators of climatic warming trends because they have relatively few species and simple food webs. Many of these systems are dominated by lake trout, which act as keystone predators. For arctic Alaska Toolik Lake, we have a 16-yr record of physical, chemical, and biological data. Our temperature data show a 3 degrees C increase in mean July epilimnetic temperatures. An individual-based bioenergetics model for young-of-year (YOY) lake trout in the lake was used to examine the effects of climate warming on growth of YOY lake trout. Our simulation models predicted that with a July temperature increase, YOY lake trout would need to consume >8-fold more food (>10-fold with seasonally increased temperatures) to achieve the same end-of-year size as historically surviving YOY lake trout. We have observed no increase in food availability in the lake, and recent analysis shows that primary productivity has actually decreased. If recent changes in the lake foreshadow a long-term trend, our model results suggest that YOY lake trout will not survive their first winter. Such changes, coupled with other current anthropogenic impacts in the arctic, may disrupt lake trout control of the trophic structure in arctic lakes.",0
"During the last few decades, the number of forest fires has been increasing in the Mediterranean Basin due to several factors, among others global warming. Large burned areas are promoting a higher number of naturally regenerated stands which are being poorly managed in general, causing the risk of new wildfires to increase. The most important conifer in dry areas is Pinus halepensis Mill., a well-adapted species to fire-prone habitats due to its high post-fire seeding capacity. High seedling density in the regenerated areas produces high inter-specific competition, which could induce low cone production related to an insufficient amount of seeds stored in the canopy for post-fire recolonization (immaturity risk); adequate young pine tree stand management is therefore required, mainly based on thinning and pruning. In this study different thinning intensities, with and without pruning, were tested in two Aleppo pine post-fire regenerated areas at 5 and 10 years after a fire event. Significant relationships between seed and cone characteristics to site, treatment, cone age and cone type were found. Also the relatively little importance of Aleppo pine seeds in the soil seed bank was checked. The optimal management strategies for Aleppo pine forests in good site quality 5 years after fire was a final density of 1600 trees ha(-1) (plus pruning after 5 years) or 800 trees ha(-1) as well as a final density of 800 trees ha(-1) plus pruning after 10 years. In poor site quality, the best method was no treatment or thinning to 1600 trees ha(-1) 5 years after fire plus pruning after another 5 years. This management policy can produce benefits in the reproductive processes of Aleppo pine after fire regeneration, as it shortens the juvenile phase and promotes a higher amount of closed cones stored in the canopy, thus increasing the canopy seed bank and reducing the immaturity risk.

"The concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are rising at a rapid rate which the human race has not experienced up to now. Methane is the important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide is the gas now being paid most attention. Feeds ingested by herbivores include structural carbohydrates in the cell walls of plants. These polysaccharides are not digestible by digestive enzymes secreted from alimentary canal. However, many prokaryotic and enkaryotic bacteria synthesize enzyme complexes capable of degrading them efficiently, In consequence, huge amount of acetate and hydrogen are produced by the oxidation of pyruvate. It has been shown that hydrogen is a principal substrate for rumen methanogenesis by relating the rate of production of methane in rumen fluid. Thus, high digestibility of fibrous materials may result in high methane emission from enteric fermentation. Intensive research efforts have been directed towards the discovery of chemical agents which will modulate ruminal fermentation to improve feed efficiency. It is worth noting that overall the complex ecological system of the rumen works efficiently, particularly with aspect to cellulolysis. Therefore, our attempt to modify methane production should be selective and cause minimum disturbance to the rest of the rumen fermentation. In our efforts to seek natural manipulators which have a suppressing effect on rumen methanogenesis, prophylactic effects of sulphur containing amino acid, some plant extracts and probiotics on rumen methanogenesis have been studied in vitro and in vivo.",0
"Gobal climate change may affect wolves in Canada's High Arctic (80degrees N) acting through three trophic levels (vegetation, herbivores, and wolves). A wolf pack dependent on muskoxen and arctic hares in the Eureka area of Ellesmere Island denned and produced pups most years from at least 1986 through 1997. However, when summer snow covered vegetation in 1997 and 2000 for the first time since records were kept, halving the herbivore nutrition-replenishment period, muskox and hare numbers dropped drastically, and the area stopped supporting denning wolves through 2003. The unusual weather triggering these events was consistent with global-climate-change phenomena.",0
"Jellyfish blooms cause problems worldwide, and they may increase with global warming, water pollution, and over fishing. Benthic polyps (scyphistomae) asexually produce buds and small jellyfish (ephyrae), and this process may determine the population size of the large, swimming scyphomedusae. Environmental factors that affect the asexual reproduction rates include food, temperature, salinity, and light. In this study, polyps of Aurelia aurita (L.), which inhabit Tapong Bay, southwest Taiwan, were tested in nine combinations of temperature (20, 25, 30 degrees C) and light intensity (372, 56, and 0 lux) in a 12 h light-12 h dark photoperiod. Production of new buds decreased with warmer temperature and stronger light intensity. Warm temperature accelerated strobilation and increased the daily production of ephyrae. The proportion of ephyrae of total asexual reproduction (new buds + ephyrae) increased dramatically in warmer temperature and more light. Survival was reduced in the highest temperature. Strobilation did not occur in the lowest temperature in darkness. All measures of total asexual reproduction indicated that mid- to high temperatures would lead to faster production of more jellyfish. Continuous high temperatures might result in high polyp mortality. Light affected asexual reproduction less than did temperature, only significantly accelerating the strobilation rate. Because the interactive effects of light and temperature were significant for the time period polyps survived and the potential production of jellyfish polyp(-1), combined light and temperature effects probably are important for strobilation in situ.",0
"New Zealand has recently followed the path of several other countries in promoting solar hot water (SHW) systems in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, yet the economic efficiency of large-scale policies to encourage SHW remains a pressing question for policymakers. This paper develops an economic framework to examine policies to promote SHW in New Zealand, including the current information, training, and subsidy policy. The economic framework points to environmental, energy security, and average-cost electricity retail pricing market failures as motivation for SHW policy, with the global climate change externality the most important of these. The results indicate that domestic SHW systems are close to being financially attractive from a consumer perspective, but a more substantial subsidy policy would be necessary for SHW to appeal to a wider audience. Such a policy is far more likely to have positive net benefits than a policy of mandating SHW on all homes or all new homes in New Zealand, and could be justified on economic efficiency grounds under reasonable assumptions. However, this result reverses under an economy-wide carbon trading system that internalizes the environmental externality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Likely increase in energy use in air-conditioned office buildings due to climate change in subtropical Hong Kong was estimated for two emissions scenarios. Towards the end of the 21st century (i.e. 2091 - 2100), the average annual building energy use would be 6.6% and 8.1% more than that in 1979-2008 for low and medium forcing, respectively. Potential mitigation measures concerning the building envelope, internal condition, lighting load density (LLD) and chiller plant were considered. Thermal insulation to the external wall would not be effective to mitigate the expected increase in building energy use due to climate change. Controlling the amount of solar heat gain through the window would be a better option. Lowering the current LLD of 15 W/m(2) to about 13 W/m(2) would result in substantial energy savings because of the reduction in electricity consumption for both electric lighting and air-conditioning. As for the chiller plant, the coefficient of performance (COP) should be improved from the current minimum requirement of 4.7 to at least 5.5 to alleviate the impact of climate change. Raising the summer set point temperature (SST) to 25.5 degrees C or higher would have high energy saving and hence mitigation potential, which could be readily applied to both new and existing buildings.

"This paper aims at examining the impacts of climate change on pesticide loss to surface water through a modeling study. An integrated modeling system which combined a distributed pesticide loss model with geographic information system (GIS), database, and climate change scenarios was proposed. It can predict pesticide loss through runoff under climatic change conditions. A case study was used to calibrate and verify the proposed system. The atrazine loss in 2050 and 2100 was predicted under different climate change scenarios. With the global warming, the annual streamflow would augment by 3 to 5% and the total atrazine losses would also gradually increase by 4 to 7%. The maximum concentrations of atrazine in river would be raised by 2.5 to 23%. It was also found that the wet season would always take the biggest share of pesticide-loss contribution to the river. A sensitive analysis disclosed that both of streamflow and pesticide concentration are more sensitive to temperature increase than decrease. This study is the first one to quantify the relationship between pesticide loss and climate change through a mathematic modeling system. The results can help people more effectively assess climate-change impacts, manage pesticide practices, and control water pollution.",0
"The limits between sea and land were estimated at ""Pulso"" beach located in the Southeastern Brazilian shelf (phi =23 degrees 33'17.4886 '' S;. lambda=045 degrees 13'13.0504 '' W - WGS84), between the island of Sao Sebastiao and the city of Ubatuba, SP, Brazil. The relative sea level of the year 1831 at ""Pulso"" beach, as per Brazilian law Number 9760 dated from 1946, was estimated and materialized. The retro-estimation allowed the demarcation of the Legal Sea-Land Limits at ""Pulso"" beach as per the terms of the law. The accuracy of the procedure for the transference of the long-term sea level from the research station of Ubatuba to ""Pulso"" beach was assessed by parallel work of geometrical leveling referred to the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) geodetic network. The motivation, the hypotheses (Brest, Cananeia and IPCC) and the methods here used are described, together with a short history of the Legal Sea-Land Limits. The results indicated that the legal Sea-Land Limits at ""Pulso"" beach are well within the beach area. They were determined as per law 9760, and there is the need to reactivate the national network of sea level gauge.",0
"The CLAW hypothesis argues that a negative feedback mechanism involving phytoplankton-derived dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) could mitigate increasing sea surface temperatures that result from global warming. DMSP is converted to the climatically active dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is transferred to the atmosphere and photochemically oxidized to sulfate aerosols, leading to increases in planetary albedo and cooling of the Earth's atmosphere. A shipboard incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of increased temperature and pCO(2) on the algal community structure of the North Atlantic spring bloom and their subsequent impact on particulate and dissolved DMSP concentrations (DMSPP and DMSPd). Under 'greenhouse' conditions (elevated pCO(2); 690 ppm) and elevated temperature (ambient + 4 degrees C), coccolithophorid and pelagophyte abundances were significantly higher than under control conditions (390 ppm CO2 and ambient temperature). This shift in phytoplankton community structure also resulted in an increase in DMSPp concentrations and DMSPp:chl a ratios. There were also increases in DMSP-lyase activity and biomass-normalized DMSP-lyase activity under 'greenhouse' conditions. Concentrations of DMSPd decreased in the 'greenhouse' treatment relative to the control. This decline is thought to be partly due to changes in the microzooplankton community structure and decreased grazing pressure under 'greenhouse' conditions. The increases in DMSPp in the high temperature and greenhouse treatments support the CLAW hypothesis; the declines in DMSPd do not.",0
"Outbreaks of jellyfish are reported worldwide, yet the environmental factors that control the sizes of jellyfish populations are not well understood. The scyphomedusan Chrysaora quinquecirrha occurs in the mesohaline portion of Chesapeake Bay each summer. Population sizes of the medusae show dramatic annual variations that are correlated with salinity and temperature. We measured the total numbers of ephyrae and polyps produced by benthic polyps of C. quinquecirrha in laboratory experiments lasting 42 d, and found that temperature (15, 20, 25 degrees C) was not a statistically significant factor at low salinities (5 to 20 parts per thousand); however, ephyra production increased significantly with increasing temperature at high salinities (20 to 35 parts per thousand). Conversely, each 5 degrees C: decrease in temperature delayed strobilation (ephyra production) by about 1 wk. Salinity significantly affected the numbers of ephyrae and polyps produced in all experiments. Ephyra and polyp production was lower at both low (<11 parts per thousand) and high salinities (greater than or equal to 25 parts per thousand) than at intermediate salinities. Also, more ephyrae, but, not polyps, were produced with more available prey. Medusa numbers were 2 orders of magnitude lower in July 1996 when water temperatures, salinities, and zooplankton densities in Chesapeake Bay all were lower than in July 1995. The effects of these factors are important in understanding the changes caused by human activities in near-shore ecosystems, including effects of global warming, eutrophication, and reduction of commercial species.",0
"Background: Forecasting the effects of global changes on high altitude ecosystems requires an understanding of the long-term relationships between biota and forcing factors to identify resilience thresholds. Fire is a crucial forcing factor: both fuel build-up from land-abandonment in European mountains, and more droughts linked to global warming are likely to increase fire risks. Methods: To assess the vegetation response to fire on a millennium time-scale, we analyzed evidence of stand-to-local vegetation dynamics derived from sedimentary plant macroremains from two subalpine lakes. Paleobotanical reconstructions at high temporal resolution, together with a fire frequency reconstruction inferred from sedimentary charcoal, were analyzed by Superposed Epoch Analysis to model plant behavior before, during and after fire events. Principal Findings: We show that fuel build-up from arolla pine (Pinus cembra) always precedes fires, which is immediately followed by a rapid increase of birch (Betula sp.), then by ericaceous species after 25-75 years, and by herbs after 50-100 years. European larch (Larix decidua), which is the natural co-dominant species of subalpine forests with Pinus cembra, is not sensitive to fire, while the abundance of Pinus cembra is altered within a 150-year period after fires. A long-term trend in vegetation dynamics is apparent, wherein species that abound later in succession are the functional drivers, loading the environment with fuel for fires. This system can only be functional if fires are mainly driven by external factors (e. g. climate), with the mean interval between fires being longer than the minimum time required to reach the late successional stage, here 150 years. Conclusion: Current global warming conditions which increase drought occurrences, combined with the abandonment of land in European mountain areas, creates ideal ecological conditions for the ignition and the spread of fire. A fire return interval of less than 150 years would threaten the dominant species and might override the resilience of subalpine forests.",0
"Theory proposes that increased environmental stochasticity negatively impacts population viability. Thus, in addition to the directional changes predicted for weather parameters under global climate change (GCC), the increase in variance of these parameters may also have a negative effect on biodiversity. As a case study, we assessed the impact of interannual variance in precipitation on the viability of an Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) population reintroduced in Makhtesh Ramon Nature Reserve, Israel. We monitored the population from 1985 to 1999 to determine what environmental factors affect reproductive success. Annual precipitation during the year before conception, drought conditions during gestation, and population size determined reproductive success. We used the parameters derived from this model to assess population performance under various scenarios in a Leslie matrix type model with demographic and environmental stochasticity. Specifically, we used a change in the precipitation regime in our study area to formulate a GCC scenario and compared the simulated dynamics of the population with a no-change scenario. The coefficient of variation in population size under the global change scenario was 30% higher than under the no-change scenario. Minor die-offs (>= 15%) following droughts increased extinction probability nearly 10-fold. Our results support the idea that an increase in environmental stochasticity due to GCC may, in itself, pose a significant threat to biodiversity.",0
"A remedy called ""geo-engineering solution'' has been recently proposed by some scientists to handle the global warming problem through injection of sulfates high aloft into the stratosphere. However, this idea may have some other side impacts. We have investigated the perturbation caused by geo-engineering solution on the stratospheric charged species using a coupled neutral-ion photochemical model. Model calculations indicate additional production of sulfuric acid immediately after the injection which further leads to increased abundance of heavy negative ion family by several orders of magnitude over the ambient. After 2 months, most of the H(2)SO(4) vapor condensed to H(2)SO(4) aerosols and the density of charged aerosol increases several folds and the effect spread further in the tropics. The perturbation in ionic species spread globally after about 1 year but became weaker in magnitude. The ion perturbation has implications on the electrical properties of the atmospheric medium.",0
"The global warming has led to enormous challenges worldwide for a large variety of communities, particularly these associated to water and water treatment industry. Due to increasing scarcity of water resources, the development of new membrane materials and water treatment processes will play an important role in tackling this emerging problem. In this paper, the recent development in characterization of in particular, geometrical parameters of micro- and nano-membrane materials will be reviewed. Membranes with micro- and nano-pores have widely been used for ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. The structure of the pores and the surface of the pores/membranes may be optimized to achieve much improved flow rate in these micro-/nano-channels. Therefore, accurate characterization of porous structures will contribute significantly to the prediction of membrane performance. It will not only provide an insight into the new characterization methods but also the development of novel materials. (c) 2008 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Detecting coherent signals of climate change is best achieved by conducting expansive, long-term studies. Here, using counts of waders (Charadrii) collected from ca. 3500 sites over 30 years and covering a major portion of western Europe, we present the largest-scale study to show that faunal abundance is influenced by climate in winter. We demonstrate that the 'weighted centroids' of populations of seven species of wader occurring in internationally important numbers have undergone substantial shifts of up to 115 km, generally in a northeasterly direction. To our knowledge, this shift is greater than that recorded in any other study, but closer to what would be expected as a result of the spatial distribution of ecological zones. We establish that year-to-year changes in site abundance have been positively correlated with concurrent changes in temperature, but that this relationship is most marked towards the colder extremities of the birds' range, suggesting that shifts have occurred as a result of range expansion and that responses to climate change are temperature dependent. Many attempts to model the future impacts of climate change on the distribution of organisms, assume uniform responses or shifts throughout a species' range or with temperature, but our results suggest that this may not be a valid approach. We propose that, with warming temperatures, hitherto unsuitable sites in northeastern Europe will host increasingly important wader numbers, but that this may not be matched by declines elsewhere within the study area. The need to establish that such changes are occurring is accentuated by the statutory importance of this taxon in the designation of protected areas.",0
"Climate policy has assumed an extreme degree of urgency in the international debate in recent years. This article begins by taking a critical look at the scientific underpinnings of the efforts to stabilize the climate. It points to several serious question marks on the purported relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, and expresses distrust about claims of impending catastrophes related to rising sea levels, hurricanes, and spread of infectious disease. It then reviews the concurrent climate policy efforts and concludes that they are incoherent, misguided and unduly costly, and that they have so far had no perceptible impact on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The exceedingly ambitious policy plans currently under preparation suffer from similar fallacies. For these reasons, but also because of the remaining scientific doubts and the exorbitant costs that have to be incurred, skepticism is expressed about the preparedness to implement the climate policy plans currently on the table.",0
"The global warming potential (GWP) reduction of the perfluorinated compound (PFC) semiconductor manufacturing gas, C4F8, has been studied in an inductively coupled high-frequency (13.56 MHz) plasma system operating under multimode antenna. Mass spectral analysis of the decomposed species showed that major ionic species in the present study were (CFx+ (x = 1, 3) and C2F4+). Weak signals of CF4+ ions were detected for the first time in a C4F8 plasma. The behavior of the CF4+, C2F4+ and CF3+ ion peaks at various gas pressures (1-50 mTorr) and the effect of additive oxygen on the decomposition of the parent gas and CF4 have been presented. The mechanism of electron energy control was proposed for the effective decomposition of the C4F8 gas. The overall results showed that, at a higher azimuthal mode of antenna (m = 1) the C4F8 decomposition and its GWP reduction was significant and it was considered to be due to the electron energy control at that mode.",0
"Ringing recovery datasets at ringing centres cover large areas and long time-spans, and, therefore, they are interesting for investigating long-term changes in bird migration. However, heterogeneity of data in terms of ringing activity, recapture and re-sighting efforts and recovery probabilities as well as reporting probabilities of recoveries on a temporal and spatial scale are major obstacles to such analyses. Among 30 species of short-distance or partial migrants from Germany we found evidence for significantly increased proportions of winter recoveries within a distance less than 100 km in recent years in nine species. We found evidence for reduced mean recovery distances in eight species and evidence for increased mean recovery distances in five species. Increases in recovery distances might result from changes in reporting probabilities of hunted birds, density-dependent changes and probably other reasons. A tendency towards wintering at higher latitudes in recent years was found in 10 species while mean latitudes of winter recoveries moved southwards in three species. These results are mainly consistent with studies from other European regions. Changes in geographical distribution of recoveries may be interpreted from a global warming perspective, although only one study (Soutullo, 2003) has so far demonstrated direct relationships (although inconsistent) between migration distance (wintering latitude) and climate variables. Since other factors such as changes in land use, winter feeding, availability of garbage dumps and other environmental changes may affect the position of wintering areas, these changes have to be taken into account when changes in migratory behaviour are analysed.",0
"This paper, which provides background for other papers in the volume, first reviews the nature and development of water resources planning and evaluation criteria at the Federal level in the United States. These criteria constitute a highly developed, complex set of guidelines for project planning and evaluation. The level of development of these criteria and their long historical development from theoretical foundations must be taken into account in relating global climate change to possible changes in planning criteria. Second, the essentials of water project planning and evaluation, including benefit-cost principles and more complex concepts of social decision-making, are outlined. Third, the paper provides an overview of global climate change assessment methods, including impact assessment and integrated assessment. Impact assessment uses a relatively straightforward comparison of with and without situations; integrated assessment attempts to improve on impact assessment by developing more complex models that incorporate a range of feedbacks and interrelationships.",0
"Wild stocks of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, have experienced recent declines in some areas of their range. Also, the release of hatchery chum salmon has escalated to nearly three billion fish annually. The decline of wild stocks and the unknown effects of hatchery fish combined with the uncertainty of future production caused by global climate change have renewed interest in the migratory patterns of chum salmon on the high seas. We studied the composition of high-seas mixtures of maturing and immature individuals using baseline data for 20 allozyme loci from 356 populations from throughout the Pacific Rim. Composition estimates were made from three time series. Two of these time series were from important coastal migratory corridors: the Shumagin Islands south of the Alaska Peninsula and the east coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. The third was from chum salmon captured incidentally in the Bering Sea trawl fishery for walleye pollock. We also analyzed geographically dispersed collections of chum salmon captured in the month of July. The time series show dynamic changes in stock composition. The Shumagin Island corridor was used primarily by Northwest Alaskan and Asian populations in June; by the end of July stocks from the Alaska Peninsula and southern North America dominated the composition. The composition along the Kamchatka coast changed dramatically from primarily Russian stocks in May to primarily Japanese stocks in August; the previously undocumented presence of stocks from the Alaska Peninsula and Gulf of Alaska was also demonstrated. Immature chum salmon from throughout the Pacific Rim, including large proportions of southern North American stocks, contributed to the Bering Sea bycatch during the months of September and October. The migration routes of North American stocks is far more widespread than previously observed, and the Bering Sea is an important rearing area for maturing and immature chum salmon from throughout the species' range.",0
"In the northern hemisphere, there is compelling evidence for climate-related advances of spring events, but no such long-term biological time series exist for the southern hemisphere. We have studied a unique data set of dates of first arrival and laying of first eggs over a 55-year period for the entire community of Antarctic seabirds in East Antarctica. The records over this long period show a general unexpected tendency toward later arrival and laying, an inverse trend to those observed in the northern hemisphere. Overall, species now arrive at their colonies 9.1 days later, on average, and lay eggs an average of 2.1 days later than in the early 1950s. Furthermore, these delays are linked to a decrease in sea ice extent that has occurred in eastern Antarctica, which underlies the contrasted effects of global climate change on species in Antarctica.",0
"This paper explores the value of using community risk assessments (CRAs) for climate change adaptation. CRA refers to participatory methods to assess hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities in support of community-based disaster risk reduction, used by many NGOs, community-based organizations, and the Red Cross/Red Crescent. We review the evolution of climate change adaptation and community-based disaster risk reduction, and highlight the challenges of integrating global climate change into a bottom-up and place-based approach. Our analysis of CRAs carried out by various national Red Cross societies shows that CRAs can help address those challenges by fostering community engagement in climate risk reduction, particularly given that many strategies to deal with current climate risks also help to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Climate change can also be explicitly incorporated in CRAs by making better use of CRA tools to assess trends, and by addressing the notion of changing risks. However, a key challenge is to keep CRAs simple enough for wide application. This demands special attention in the modification of CRA tools; in the background materials and trainings for CRA facilitators; and in the guidance for interpretation of CRA outcomes. A second challenge is the application of a limited set of CRA results to guide risk reduction in other communities and to inform national and international adaptation policy. This requires specific attention for sampling and care in scaling up qualitative findings. Finally, stronger linkages are needed between organizations facilitating CRAs and suppliers of climate information, particularly addressing the translation of climate information to the community level.

"Computations of storm surges during the 20th century needs to incorporate global warming of about 0.6 degreesC +/- 0.2 degreesC (IPCC, 2001). In order to take this global warming into consideration, the development of all storm surges occurred during the 20th century have been analysed. The study comprises determining to what degree the storm surge curve and storm surge level depend on each other. This fact can be used to calculate a maximum storm surge curve and each single storm surge event can be summarised. The tendency of the surge and wind parameters do not show that this maximum storm surge levels in the 20th century will occur earlier than predicted, however, the global warming of 0.6 degreesC will extend the duration of the mean storm surge curve.",0
"Eusocial organisms are characterized by cooperative brood care, generation overlap and reproductive division of labour. Traits associated with eusociality are most developed in ants, termites, paper wasps and corbiculate bees; the fossil record indicates that each of these advanced eusocial taxa evolved in the Late Cretaceous or earlier (greater than 65 Myr ago). Halictid bees also include a large and diverse number of eusocial members, but, in contrast to advanced eusocial taxa, they are characterized by substantial intra- and inter-specific variation in social behaviour, which may be indicative of more recent eusocial evolution. To test this hypothesis, we used over 2400 bp of DNA sequence data gathered from three protein-coding nuclear genes (opsin, wingless and EF-1a) to infer the phylogeny of eusocial halictid lineages and their relatives. Results from relaxed molecular clock dating techniques that utilize a combination of molecular and fossil data indicate that the three independent origins of eusociality in halictid bees occurred within a narrow time frame between approximately 20 and 22 Myr ago. This relatively recent evolution helps to explain the pronounced levels of social variation observed within these bees. The three origins of eusociality appear to be temporally correlated with a period of global warming, suggesting that climate may have had an important role in the evolution and maintenance of eusociality in these bees.",0
"Two deeply submerged coral reefs were sampled with the HURL submersible Pisces V off the islands of Hawaii and Maul. An ancient fringing reef at 950 m depth on the Kohala dope of Hawaii was observed from deep-towed camera photographs and during submersible operations. A second reef at 1650 m depth on the Haleakala slope of Maul was observed on side-scan images, deep-towed camera photographs and during submersible observations. Ages of the two reefs were determined by electron spin resonance dating with a signal intensity for aragonitic coral at g = 2.0007 used to ascertain the accumulated dose by the additive dose method. Uranium concentration was measured by neutron activation analysis. The chronology of the reefs indicates that drowning coincided with periods of rapid global climate change at the termination of continental glaciation at approximately 250 ka and 340 ka. The drowning events correlate with oxygen isotope stage boundaries 7/8 and 9/10. These data support models of reef drowning on subsiding volcanic edifices.",0
"The delta(18)O data obtained from an 18.7 m ice core drilled in Chongce Ice Cap at an elevation of 6,530 m a.s.l. in the West Kunlun Mountains on the northern Tibetan Plateau show a strong correlation with the summer temperature of the middle to upper troposphere over the mid-high latitudes of Eurasia. Based on this, the delta(18)O record can be used as a proxy of the June-September mean temperature of the mid-upper troposphere (MUT) from 1903 to 1992. The time span of the ice core record is much longer than the meteorological data available only after 1948. Using the empirical mode decomposition method (EMD), the delta(18)O record is decomposed into various frequency components and compared with the solar irradiance variations of the same period. The results show that (1) The June-September mean temperature of the MUT over Eurasian mid-high latitudes is completely decomposed into four IMF (intrinsic mode function) components and an increasing trend. (2) Solar irradiance is decomposed into the Schwabe cycle, the Hale cycle, the Gleissberg cycle, and an increasing trend. (3) The correlation coefficients between the June and September mean temperatures of the MUT over Eurasian mid-high latitudes and solar irradiance on the longer timescales (at least more than 11-year) show the significant correlations; their phase changes are basically identical in general, and (4) the 11-year Schwabe cycle exists in the June-September mean temperature of the MUT over Eurasian mid-high latitudes during most of the time from 1903 to 1992, and only in the two high-temperature phases (1929-1944 and from 1975 to the present) may global warming disturb this relation. A full understanding of this phenomenon would shed insight into the potential consequence of global warming on the MUT.",0
"After an unusual number of storms in the Urals in the early 1990s and with the global warming over the past 100 years, there were fears of increasing storm frequency in this region. This study investigates meteorological data, aspects of windthrow and the beginnings of reforestation after windthrow under different silvicultural treatments. The meteorological data were collected from a region covering an area of over 20 million ha of the Urals to the west and to the east. Storm frequency was analysed for 1946-1996 and windthrow events for 1965-1996, according to the availability of data. Regeneration experiments were begun on two experimental plots of 20 and 12 ha, respectively. Each was divided into three sub-plots, one being left untouched, one roughly logged and the last roughly logged and then replanted. Mean temperatures in the Urals showed a rise during the last more than 100 years, indeed, but neither the annual number of storms nor their mean wind speed increased. Only a few forest enterprises suffered windthrow on more than 1% of their total area. Most of the windthrown trees were of medium height and diameter. With two exceptions none of the storms greatly altered the structure of the forests. With over 3700 trees taller than 20 cm and up to 11 species, the forests showed great diversity. Neither windthrow, nor logging and clearing diminished the diversity, but all reduced the abundance of most of the species. These forests, left to regenerate naturally for some decades after clear-cutting, show a much higher number of species and individual trees than intensively managed conifer forests in the Swiss Alps. Therefore, it is recommended that natural development processes be more often integrated into conventional forest management methods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Northern wetlands may be a potential carbon source to the atmosphere upon global warming, particularly with regard to methane. However, recent conclusions have largely been based on short-term field measurements. We incubated three wetland soils representing a range of substrate quality for 80 wk in the laboratory under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 15 degrees and 30 degrees C. The soils were obtained from a Scirpus-Carex-dominated meadow in an abandoned beaver pond and from the surface and at 1 m depth of a spruce (Picea)-Sphagnum bog in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Substrate quality was assessed by fractionation of carbon compounds and summarized using principal components analysis. Nitrogen and carbon mineralization, the partitioning of carbon between carbon dioxide and methane, pH, and Eh were measured periodically over the course of the incubation. The responses of nitrogen mineralization, carbon mineralization, and trace gas partitioning to both temperature and aeration depended strongly on the substrate quality of the soils. Sedge meadow soil had the highest nitrogen and carbon mineralization rates and methane production under anaerobic conditions, and carbon mineralization under aerobic conditions, but the surface peats had the highest nitrogen mineralization rates under aerobic conditions. Methanogenesis was highest in the sedge soil but less sensitive to temperature than in the peats. A double exponential model showed that most of the variation in nitrogen and carbon mineralization among the soils and treatments was accounted for by differences in the size and kinetics of a relatively small labile pool. The kinetics of this pool were more sensitive to changes in temperature and aeration than that of the larger recalcitrant pool. Principal components analysis separated the soils on the basis of labile and recalcitrant carbon fractions. Total C and N mineralization correlated positively with the factor representing labile elements, while methanogenesis also showed a negative correlation with the factor representing recalcitrant elements. Estimates of atmospheric feedbacks from northern wetlands upon climatic change must account for extreme local variation in substrate quality and wetland type; global projections based on extrapolations from a few field measurements do not account for this local variation and may be in error.",0
"In most natural ecosystems a significant portion of carbon fixed through photosynthesis is allocated to the production and maintenance of fine roots, the ephemeral portion of the root system that absorbs growth-limiting moisture and nutrients. In turn, senescence of fine roots can be the greatest source of C input to forest soils. Consequently, important questions in ecology entail the extent to which increasing atmospheric CO2 may alter the allocation of carbon to, and demography of, fine roots. Using microvideo and image analysis technology, we demonstrate that elevated atmospheric CO2 increases the rates of both fine root production and mortality. Rates of root mortality also increased substantially as soil nitrogen availability increased, regardless of CO2 concentration. Nitrogen greatly influenced the proportional allocation of carbon to leaves vs. fine roots. The amount of available nitrogen in the soil appears to be the most important factor regulating fine root demography in Populus trees.",0
"There has been considerable debate on whether root/rhizosphere respiration or bulk soil respiration is more sensitive to long-term temperature changes. We investigated the response of belowground respiration to soil warming by 3 degrees C above ambient in bare soil plots and plots planted with wheat and maize. Initially, belowground respiration responded more to the soil warming in bare soil plots than in planted plots. However, as the growing season progressed, a greater soil-warming response developed in the planted plots as the contribution of root/rhizosphere respiration to belowground respiration declined. A negative correlation was observed between the contribution of root/rhizosphere respiration to total belowground respiration and the magnitude of the soil-warming response indicating that bulk soil respiration is more temperature sensitive than root/rhizosphere respiration. The dependence of root/rhizosphere respiration on substrate provision from photosynthesis is the most probable explanation for the observed lower temperature sensitivity of root/rhizosphere respiration. At harvest in late September, final crop biomass did not differ between the two soil temperature treatments in either the maize or wheat plots. Postharvest, flux measurements during the winter months indicated that the response of belowground respiration to the soil-warming treatment increased in magnitude (response equated to a Q(10) value of 5.7 compared with similar to 2.3 during the growing season). However, it appeared that this response was partly caused by a strong indirect effect of soil warming. When measurements were made at a common temperature, belowground respiration remained higher in the warmed subplots suggesting soil warming had maintained a more active microbial community through the winter months. It is proposed that any changes in winter temperatures, resulting from global warming, could alter the sink strength of terrestrial ecosystems considerably.",0
"In this work, the authors investigated the spring dust storm frequency variations in northern China and its relationship with weather disturbances, cold high, eddy kinetic energy (EKE), as well as the impact of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) on the dust storm frequency variations. It is found that there is a significantly decreasing trend of -26%/10 years in the dust storm frequency variations. In addition, the year-to-year variations are also remarkable, which account for 58.3% of the total variance of the dust storm frequency variations. The synoptic variance of 850 hPa height, EKE, and near-surface cold highs are highly correlated with the dust storm frequency variations. During the last 40 years or so, there have been significant trends in synoptic variance, cold-high frequency, and kinetic energy over northern China and Mongolia, which are -3.2, -4.0, and -5.0%/10 years, respectively. The trends are fairly consistent with long-term variations of dust storm frequency. The AO shows good correlation with the interannual variations of the dust storm frequency. This out-of-phase relation is supported by the significantly negative correlations between AO index and eddy growth rate between 850/700 hPa in midlatitude East Asia, implying that AO can modulate weather disturbances and dust storm activities through influencing the atmospheric instability. It is found, however, that the spring AO index shows no evident long-term trend. Land cover changes, global warming, and other climate teleconnections may, at least partly, be responsible for the secular decreasing of dust storm frequency over northern China.

"In the 21st century increasing societal, environmental, and economic pressures will create a changing context for solving agricultural pest management problems. Interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving will be needed to meet goals such as mitigating environmental degradation associated with the use of farm chemicals, and increasing productivity by reducing insect and disease damage to crops, and reducing competition from weeds. Crop system models will provide useful frameworks in which to examine the interrelationships among plants, the pest complex, and the environment to determine the most appropriate management strategies to meet individual and societal goals. Improved techniques for managing pests, such as transgenic plants resistant to pests and diseases, new biological control agents, innovative cultural controls, biological pesticides, and additional information to improve efficacy of traditional chemicals, will require weather data and forecasts in order to be used, and climate information to determine their suitability for use. Climatic change, including global warming and increased variability, will require improved analyses that can be used to assess risks associated with existing and newly developed pest management strategies and techniques, and to gauge the impact of these techniques on productivity and profitability. Control recommendations will need to be evaluated for suitability in the farming system where they are to be implemented. Training in the basics of agrometeorological relationships and pest management disciplines will have to be supplied to agricultural meteorologists, extension personnel involved in this work, and farmers. Research to successfully develop the new technologies and the weather and climatic information required by the technologies must be approached by interdisciplinary teams that include agricultural meteorologists.

"This paper examines the aggregate net costs and individual country cost savings of greenhouse gas emissions trading among Pacific Rim countries. We propose emission permit allocation rules designed to entice developing countries to participate. Absence of developing country involvement has served as an excuse for the lack by participation by the United States in the first compliance period of the Kyoto Protocol and may serve as a disincentive to even more countries in subsequent periods. Our analysis specifies permit allocation rules that could result in no net costs, and even cost-savings, to developing countries for their involvement in the emissions trading market, while at the same time providing extensive benefits to industrialized countries through access to lower-cost mitigation alternatives.

"The impact of climate warming on yield losses caused by potato late blight and on the need for disease control was studied by constructing models for timing late blight epidemics and a model of potato growth constrained by late blight. Empirical models predicting the date of planting and emergence of potato were based on thermal time, and a model predicting the date of late blight outbreak was based on thermal time on rainy days. Experiments were conducted over 3 years under ambient and elevated (+3 degrees C) temperatures to obtain parameter values for the growth model. Potato emergence is predicted to occur at 631 degree days accumulated above 0 degrees C after the 16-day running mean temperature in spring exceeds 0 degrees C. A blight outbreak is predicted to occur when the effective temperature sum accumulated above 8 degrees C after potato emergence, on days with at least 0.1 mm of precipitation, achieves 156 degree days. In the prediction of the outbreak the maximum daily accumulation of temperature is limited to 10 degree days. A preliminary sensitivity study carried out at one site in southern Finland suggests that over a range of 1 to 3 degrees C warming, the period during which late blight needs to be controlled by fungicide applications would be 10-20 days longer per 1 degrees C of warming. The increase in yield loss of unprotected crops would be of the same magnitude as the increase in yield potential, around 2 t/ha of dry matter per 1 degrees C of warming.",0
"For a time series generated by polynomial trend with stationary long-memory errors, the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of the trend coefficients is asymptotically normal, provided the error process is linear. The asymptotic distribution may no longer be normal, if the error is in the form of a long-memory linear process passing through certain nonlinear transformations. However, one hardly has sufficient information about the transformation to determine which type of limiting distribution the OLSE converges to and to apply the correct distribution so as to construct valid confidence intervals for the coefficients based on the OLSE. The present paper proposes a modified least squares estimator to bypass this drawback. It is shown that the asymptotic normality can be assured for the modified estimator with mild trade-off of efficiency even when the error is nonlinear and the original limit for the OLSE is non-normal. The estimator performs fairly well when applied to various simulated series and two temperature data sets concerning global warming.",0
"With the global warming of concern, the secondary aluminum stream is becoming an even more important component of aluminum production and is attractive because of its economic and environmental benefits. In this work, recycling of automotive aluminum is reviewed to highlight environmental benefits of aluminum recycling, use of aluminum alloys in automotive applications, automotive recycling process, and new technologies in aluminum scrap process. Literature survey shows that newly developed techniques such as laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and solid state recycling provide promising alternatives in aluminum scrap process. Compared with conventional remelting and subsequent refinement, solid state recycling utilizing compression and extrusion at room or moderate temperature can result in significant energy savings and higher metal yield.",0
"As a result of factors such as global warming, habitat destruction, and species introduction, amphibians are declining worldwide. No one, however, has analyzed the status of polymorphic amphibian species at a national or continental scale, although some local reports exist. Our aim was to report on the loss of intraspecific heterochrony as a loss to diversity in determining the consequences of fish stocking on European populations of paedomorphic newts. Paedomorphosis is a polymorphism in which larval traits are retained in the adult stage. We surveyed 39 paedomorphic populations of the alpine ( Triturus alpestris) and palmate ( T. helveticus) newts, all but one of which initially occupied fishless ponds and lakes in France, Italy, Slovenia, Bosnia, Montenegro, and Greece. Exotic fishes were found in 44% of the studied aquatic habitats, with a 100% presence in Montenegro. At all sites paedomorphs disappeared and metamorphs declined. Only fish explained these population changes because alternative factors such as drying were not significant. More catastrophically, fish introductions occurred in habitats known to support the largest populations of newts and even some endemic subspecies. If management and legislative measures are not taken to stop fish stocking, protect paedomorphs as conservation units at national and international levels, and restore natural habitats, all the largest paedomorphic populations may disappear in the near future. Their disappearance would represent a loss of one of the rare, fascinating examples of intraspecific heterochrony.",0
"The radiative response of tropical clouds to global warming exhibits a large spread among climate models, and this constitutes a major source of uncertainty for climate sensitivity estimates. To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty, we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled models simulating climate change and current interannual variability. We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature). This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer clouds to changing environmental conditions constitutes, currently, the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks simulated by general circulation models.",0
"In making practical decisions on technologies and products and related strategies and policies, all sustainability effects are involved, from global warming and income distribution to economic growth and habitat destruction. Judging the relative importance of these different effects, that is their evaluation, is unavoidable. Reality just is that complex. The only choice is if the judgement is made implicitly or explicitly. In the environment domain of sustainability there are at least four basically different approaches to evaluation and the underlying modelling, and at least one approach focussing on efficiency only, all with diverging outcomes. A working group involving different scientific societies is being set up to actively relate the different approaches and to see how at a practical level they might be reconciled.

"The human influence in geomorphology has a long history, and major contributions have, for example, been made by Shaler, McGee, Gilbert and Marsh. However, in the last two decades concern with global environmental change has brought the role of anthropogeomorphology into sharper focus. Global warming, if it occurs, will have important implications for many geomorphological processes and phenomena as a result of the direct effects of warming, as a consequence of other related climatic changes (e.g. precipitation change) and as a result of climatically moderated changes in major geomorphologically significant variables (e.g. vegetation cover). Large uncertainties exist with respect to such matters as hydrological response, the frequency of tropical cyclones, the speed and degree of permafrost degradation, the response of glaciers and ice caps, the extent of sea level rise, the reaction of beaches to rising sea levels, and the state of wetlands, deltas and coral reefs. Other human activities may serve to compound the effects of global warming on geomorphological processes. Given the uncertainties of so many of the environmental changes, there is a great need to obtain a greater understanding of the rates and mechanisms of landform response. Geomorphologists need, inter alia, to establish long-term study sites that will generate base-line data, to monitor the location and rate of change using sequential cartographic and remote sensing materials, to determine information on natural background levels and long-term trends by means of data gained from cores, to gain a more profound understanding of the operation of geomorphological systems particularly with regard to sensitivities and thresholds, and to appreciate the consequences of deliberate manipulation of environmental systems by humans.",0
"The late Paul Garrod, in whose honour this lecture is named, was 'the right man at the right time'. He seized the opportunities offered by the dawning of the chemotherapeutic era with vigour and enthusiasm and was a formidable link between the traditional laboratory-based bacteriologist and the more clinically orientated 'modern' medical microbiologist. Professor Garrod was a founder member of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and I had the privilege of meeting him on many occasions. He would have relished the many challenges facing today's microbiologists, infectious disease physicians and public health experts. These wilt have major implications for antimicrobial chemotherapy in the twenty-first century. The emergence and prevalence of infectious diseases, and the necessity for discovering therapies to treat them, are influenced by many factors. In this lecture I will discuss four which could have a major influence on infectious diseases in the twenty-first century-global warming, biological warfare/terrorism, the dissemination of infections, including those caused by resistant pathogens, by travellers and certain untreatable zoonotic diseases.",0
"Spectral analysis of geomagnetic activity, global air temperature, Earth's rotation rate and zonal circulation, when smoothed from secular trend and periods shorter than 23 years, shows a concentration of energy around the 60-year period explaining more than 80% of the entire variance. This information has enabled the set-up of a cascade physical model that integrates the Sun-atmosphere-Earth system as a single unit and ties solar corpuscular radiation to global warming through Earth's rotation and atmospheric circulation. Our results suggest that changes in geomagnetic activity, and in the Earth's rotation, could be used as long- and short-term indicators, respectively, of future changes in global air temperature.",0
"Intertidal mollusks are exposed to multiple stressors in estuaries, including temperature and trace metals such as cadmium, which may interactively affect their physiology. We have studied the combined effects of temperature and cadmium stress on metabolism of oysters at the whole animal and mitochondrial levels. In vivo exposure to 50 mu g L-1 Cd led to a significant increase in basal metabolic rate (BMR) in 20 degrees C-acclimated but not in 28 degrees C-acclimated oysters. Cadmium exposure resulted in a fast decrease in mitochondrial capacity to synthesize ATP in 28 degrees C-acclimated but not 20 degrees C-acclimated oysters indicating that mitochondria, may be functioning closer to their capacity limits in the former group. This agrees with elevated mortality in Cd-exposed oysters at 28 degrees C but not 20 degrees C. In general, elevated temperature increased sensitivity of oysters to cadmium at mitochondrial and whole-organism levels suggesting that oyster populations may become more susceptible to trace metal pollution during seasonal warming and/or global climate change.

"In this paper, emergy accounting (EA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methods are employed to investigate a typical urban wetland park, the Green Lake Urban Wetland Park (GLUWP) of Beijing, in terms of its environmental and capital inputs, ecosystem services and organic matter yields, environmental support, and sustainability. The LCA method is also used to obtain a quantitative estimation of the environmental impact of discharges during the entire life cycle of the GLUWP. Various emergy-based indices, such as emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental load ratio (ELR), emergy sustainability index (ESI), net economic benefit (Np), and environmental impacts of process-based LCA, including global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication (EU), nonrenewable resource depletion (RU), energy consumption (EN), acidification potential (AP), photochemical oxidant creation potential (POCP), particulate matter (PM) and wastes (W), are calculated. The results show that the GLUWP has higher proportions of renewable resource input, less pressure on the environment, more environmental support and better ecological and economic benefits, which can be considered as an environment-friendly and long-term sustainable ecological practice, compared with another constructed wetland in Beijing. Meanwhile, the dominant environmental impact is induced by POCP with the construction phase contributing the most on the entire life cycle. It is expected that increasing green area, extensively using environment-friendly materials, optimizing construction techniques and reducing power consumption can promote the sustainability of the GLUWP.

"Rainforest fragments in central Amazonia have been found to experience a marked loss of above-ground biomass caused by sharply increased rates of tree mortality and damage near fragment margins. These findings suggest that fragmentation of tropical forests is likely to increase emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases above and beyond that caused by deforestation per se. We estimated committed carbon emissions from deforestation and fragmentation in Amazonia, using three simulated models of landscape change: a 'Rondonia scenario,' which mimicked settlement schemes of small farmers in the southern Amazon; a 'Para scenario,' which imitated large cattle ranches in the eastern Amazon; and a 'random scenario,' in which forest tracts were cleared randomly. Estimates of carbon emissions for specific landscapes were from 0.3 to 42% too low, depending on the amount and spatial pattern of clearing, when based solely on deforestation. Because they created irregular habitat edges or many forest perforations which increased tree mortality, the Rondonia and random-clearing scenarios produced 2-5 times more fragmentation-induced carbon emissions than did the Para scenario, for any given level of clearing. Using current estimates of forest conversion, our simulations suggest that committed carbon emissions from forest fragmentation alone will range from 3.0 to 15.6 million t/year in the Brazilian Amazon, and from 22 to 149 million t/year for tropical forests globally.

"Global warming may reduce rice yield through poor pollination caused by high temperatures at flowering. The dominant parameter controlling the pollination stability in rice cultivars at high temperatures was studied. We examined the effects of a high daytime temperature (35.0 degrees C, 37.5 degrees C, 40.0 degrees C) and its duration (1, 3, 5 days) on the percentage of dehisced thecae, the length of dehiscence in the basal part of the theca for pollen dispersal, and pollination stability. The percentage of sufficiently pollinated florets (%SPF) decreased with the increase in daytime temperature and the duration of treatment. At a daytime temperature of 37.5 degrees C, %SPF varied widely among the cultivars and was highly correlated with the length of dehiscence formed at the basal part of the theca (r=0.930, P < 0.01, n=6) and the percentage of dehisced thecae (r=0.868, P < 0.05, n=6). The factor that better explained the variation in %SPF shifted from the length of the basal dehiscence to the percentage of dehisced thecae with increasing duration of high-temperature treatment. Thus, the process preventing pollination shifted from pollen release to anther dehiscence with the increase of exposure to a high temperature.",0
"Forest gap models are important tools for assessing the impact of global climate change on forest dynamics of tree species composition and size structure. In this study, the FAREAST gap model was used to examine the response of forest dynamics on Gongga Mountain, which is located on the southeastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau, under three climate change scenarios. The simulated results showed that the climax community of the deglaciation slash would be mixed species of Picea brachytyla, Tsuga chinensis, and Pinus densata under climate change scenarios, as opposed to the pure Abies fabri forest under the current climate. Climate change also drove replacement of Populus purdomiis by Betula utilis, which became the most abundant pioneer tree species on the deglaciation slash. Under scenarios of climate change, three responses of the four typical forests distributed between 2200 and 3580 m above sea level are observed, such as dieback of today's forest at 2200 and 3150 m, gradual change of the species composition at 2780 m, and afforestation at 3580 m. It is worth noting that the scenarios of climatic change are of inherent uncertainty, in the same way as the formulation of the ecological factors used in the models. It is suggested that simulations not be interpreted as predictions of the future development of the forest, but as a means of assessing their sensitivity to climate change. It is concluded that mountainous forests are quite sensitive to climate change.",0
"Iodotrifluoromethane (CF3I) gas is one of the environmentally conscious perfluorocarbon gases because it has a very low global warming potential. The authors have found that CF3I gas plasma drastically reduces ultraviolet (UV) photon irradiation of similar to 4.0 eV, which corresponds to the excitation energy at silicon dioxide (SiO2)/silicon (Si) interfaces, in comparison with octafluorocyclobutane (C4F8) gas. This results in reducing UV irradiation damage in dielectric film etching processes, which was experimentally confirmed by evaluating charge-pumping currents in metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistors fabricated by using CF3I gas etching. They have also demonstrated that a novel etching method using pulse-time modulation of CF3I gas plasma for the first time further reduced UV light irradiation damage.

"The best available surface temperature (T) and precipitation (P) records for Australia dating back to 1910 have been examined to look, for coherent interannual variability. P exhibits a tendency to be out of phase with daily maximum temperature, Tmax, and this results in P tending to be out of phase with both the daily average temperature, Tbar (estimated here as the average of Tmax and the daily minimum, Tmin), and the DTR (diurnal temperature range, Tmax-Tmin). The association between P and Tmin is generally weak. The (expected) increase in P associated with a positive Southern Oscillation Index is (generally) accompanied by reduced average temperatures (Tbar) and a reduced DTR, both of which primarily arise from a reduction in Tmax. When variability in both P and Tmin associated with Tmax is removed, the residual signals (P* and Tmin*) show wide-spread statistically significant positive correlations, consistent with the hypothesis that clouds help to reduce night-tine cooling. These relationships are less clear at near-coastal sites, and absent at the island and exposed coastal sites considered. Results from three separate ten-year integrations of the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre's atmospheric general circulation model were then examined. The tendency for (a) P to be out of phase with Tmax, Tbar and the DTR and (b) P* to be in phase with Tmin* over Australia on interannual time-scales was also generally evident over land elsewhere, except at high latitudes and over North Africa. An analysis of the model's surface heat budget over land showed that this arises from associated surface short wave radiation and latent heating anomalies. The latter is generally more important over low-latitude regions where deep convection occurs, with the hierarchy reversed elsewhere. Evaporative cooling anomalies appear to be dominated by soil moisture changes. Surface long wave radiation, sensible heating and subterranean heat exchange tend to reduce the temperature change which would otherwise occur. Recent changes in some of the relationships exhibited between observed P,T and the Southern Oscillation Index appear unusual in terms of the interdecadal variability evident in the records prior to 1972, and previous conclusions drawn on the basis of 'all-Australia' P and T indices were found to have broad applicability. Interrelationships between recent changes in the 20-year means of P, T and the SOI do not match the changes that might be expected on the basis of their interrelationship on interannual time-scales. Possible reasons for the changes suggested by the analysis (e.g., global warming and naturally occurring interdecadal climate variability) are discussed.",0
"The world's freshwater resources are already under severe stress. The anticipated population increase and global climate change raise further concerns on the future. Transboundary and other shared waters have been the sources of numerous conflicts between the countries and communities sharing them, and there are fears that many of these shared basins will be hotspots for violent conflicts in this century. Proper planning and management of these shared waters will play a key role in resolving future water problems and conflicts. Despite the many existing legal frameworks and bilateral/multilateral agreements, tremendous challenges remain in managing the shared waters. These challenges have scientific, political, economic, environmental, social, cultural, racial, religious, linguistic and other facets. This study discusses the human side of water planning, management and conflicts. The positive and negative effects of water planning and management on human life are presented, with particular emphasis on human behaviour. How these effects, in turn, can shape our perception of water planning and management and motivate us towards specific agenda(s) is also discussed. The water dispute in an inter-state river basin (the Cauvery River basin) in south India is chosen as a representative for discussion. It is argued that studying the transactions between humans and water-related activities should be an integral part of water research. The field of ""hydropsychology"" is proposed for this kind of study, and a few ideas are also presented for making fundamental advances.",0
"One of the best documented effects of climate change on biodiversity are shifts in phenology. However, long-term data quantifying and projecting the expected changes in phenology associated with climate warming are limited to a few well-recorded areas in the world. In the absence of temporal recording, an alternative approach is to determine the phenological response of species along marked gradients in climate or along latitudinal or altitudinal transects (space-for-time substitution). We studied the phenology (timing and duration of the flight period) of butterflies in 2006 along an altitudinal gradient (900-1680 m; estimated temperature lapse rate = -6.6 degrees C/km) in the Serrania de Cuenca (central Spain) at the assemblage and individual species levels. Timing of the flight period was later for assemblages at high than at low altitudes. A similar trend of an increasing delay in the flight period with altitude was recorded for some individual species. However, there were also some exceptions to this pattern regardless of the number of sites and the altitudinal ranges of the species, suggesting possible local adaptation to regional climate. The duration of the flight period was shorter at high altitudes for assemblages, but this trend was not mirrored in the response of individual species. The results partly support substituting space-for-time when assessing the potential effect of climate change on phenophases such as the timing of the flight period, but we recommend extreme caution in extrapolating the results in the absence of information on how the responses of populations differ.",0
"Cold winters and geographic isolation have hitherto protected the Nordic countries from many plant pathogens and insect pests, leading to a comparatively low input of pesticides. The changing climate is projected to lead to a greater rise in temperature in this region, compared to the global mean. In Scandinavia, a milder and more humid climate implies extended growing seasons and possibilities to introduce new crops, but also opportunities for crop pests and pathogens to thrive in the absence of long cold periods. Increased temperatures, changed precipitation patterns and new cultivation practices may lead to a dramatic change in crop health. Examples of diseases and insect pest problems predicted to increase in incidence and severity due to global warming are discussed.",0
"We explore the daily evolution of tropical intraseasonal oscillations in satellite-observed tropospheric temperature, precipitation, radiative fluxes, and cloud properties. The warm/rainy phase of a composited average of fifteen oscillations is accompanied by a net reduction in radiative input into the ocean-atmosphere system, with longwave heating anomalies transitioning to longwave cooling during the rainy phase. The increase in longwave cooling is traced to decreasing coverage by ice clouds, potentially supporting Lindzen's '' infrared iris '' hypothesis of climate stabilization. These observations should be considered in the testing of cloud parameterizations in climate models, which remain sources of substantial uncertainty in global warming prediction.",0
"Southeast Spain has a semiarid climate with highly variable rainfall from year to year. Global warming scenarios predict a decrease in rainfall in future and land-use changes may also alter run-off regimes. Water deficit has meant that various practices of floodwater farming have traditionally operated in valley floors. However, flash floods in the valley floors can also be dangerous and damaging. Many of the boqueras and other floodwater irrigation systems have been abandoned. The effects on the hydrological regime of the channel are calculated. These structures and water management practices could have an effect on the magnitude of low-moderate peak discharges, but are insignificant in high flows. Modem channel and flood management employs check dams, but these are frequently destroyed in moderate-high flows. Alternative strategies of channel management need to be sought and the use or vegetation cover to dissipate flood peaks and to reduce erosion may offer one possibility.

"The ice crystal enhancement (IE) factor, defined as the ratio of the ice crystal to ice nuclei (IN) number concentrations for any particular cloud condition, is needed to quantify the contribution of changes in IN to global warming. However, the ensemble characteristics of IE are still unclear. In this paper, a representation of the IE factor is incorporated into a three-ice-category microphysical scheme for use in long-term cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations. Model results are compared with remote sensing observations, which suggest that, absent a physically based consideration of how IE comes about, the IE factor in tropical clouds is about 10 3 times larger than that in midlatitudinal ones. This significant difference in IE between the tropics and middle latitudes is consistent with the observation of stronger entrainment and detrainment in the tropics. In addition, the difference also suggests that cloud microphysical parameterizations depend on spatial resolution (or subgrid turbulence parameterizations within CRMs).",0
"Relatively brief periods of severe paleoenvironmental change during the Jurassic and Cretaceous were associated with the widespread accumulation of organic-rich marine deposits, termed oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). These intervals involved abrupt global warming of similar to 5-10 degrees C, higher rates of continental weathering, elevated extinction rates, and large-scale perturbations to the global carbon cycle. The major OAEs also overlapped temporally the emplacement of large igneous provinces. However, despite being known as OAEs, the extent of seawater anoxia at those times is undefined and the causative processes remain unclear. Here we show how changes in seawater molybdenum isotope ratios (a proxy for seawater anoxia) during the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) OAE define the onset and expansion of oxygen deficient conditions. Our data also place constraints on the areal extent of marine anoxia during the event and demonstrate that anoxia expanded and contracted periodically, broadly in line with precession-driven changes in delta C-13(org). Despite their intermittent occurrence over geological history, OAEs have an important contemporary relevance because the magnitude and high rates of environmental change then were broadly similar to those occurring at the present day.",0
"Reactive-nitrogen (Nr) has a wide variety of beneficial and detrimental effects on human health. The most important of the beneficial effects are increasing global and regional food supplies and increased nutritional quality of available foods. However, lack of adequate dietary intake of amino acids and proteins is a serious cause of malnutrition when food supplies are inadequate because of poverty, drought, floods, wars, and displacements of people as refugees. There is sufficient, though limited, quantitative data indicating that increased circulation of Nr in the environment is responsible for significant human health effects via other exposure pathways. Nr can lead to harmful health effects from airborne occupational exposures and population-wide indoor and outdoor air pollution exposures to nitrogen dioxide and ozone. Nr can also affect health via water pollution problems, including methemoglobinemia from contaminated ground water, eutrophication causing fish kills and algal blooms that can be toxic to humans, and via global warming. The environmental pollutants stemming from reactive nitrogen are ubiquitous, making it difficult to identify the extent to which Nr exerts a specific health effect. As all populations are susceptible, continued interdisciplinary investigations are needed to determine the extent and nature of the beneficial and harmful effects on human health of nitrogen-related pollutants and their derivatives.",0
"Temperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and its waters have experienced well-above global average rates of ocean warming. We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidification, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region specific with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east-west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems.

"Soil microbial denitrification is a significant source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a trace gas important in global climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion. In this paper we describe a mechanistic submodel, which is incorporated in the model NLOSS, designed to predict the soil biogenic source and efflux of N2O and N-2 during denitrification, NLOSS simulates transient soil moisture and temperature, decomposition, soil anaerobicity, denitrifying bacterial biomass, rates of soil nitrogen transformations, soil trace-gas transport, and gas efflux to the atmosphere. Uncertainty in predicted N gas effluxes is commuted using a Monte Carlo approach. We test NLOSS's denitrification estimates by comparing predictions with results from a N-15 tracer experiment in a Mexican agricultural system. The model accurately predicted the measured soil moisture and denitrified N2O and N-2 fluxes during the experiment. We also apply NLOSS to compute denitrified N trace-gas speciation curves as a function of soil hydrologic properties and moisture content. These speciation curves will be used in future work to extrapolate the plot-scale modeling results presented here to field and regional estimates of N trace-gas emissions. The results presented here suggest that NLOSS can be used to identify the processes most important for trace-gas losses and to facilitate efforts to scale plot-level modeling results to regional estimates of N trace-gas emissions.",0
"We explore in this paper how animals can be affected by variation in climate, topography, vegetation characteristics, and body size. We utilize new spatially explicit state-of-the-art models that incorporate principles from heat and mass transfer engineering, physiology, morphology, and behavior that have been modified to provide spatially explicit hypotheses using GIS. We demonstrate how temporal and spatial changes in microclimate resulting from differences in topography and vegetation cover alter animal energetics, and behavior. We explore the impacts of these energetic predictions on elk energetics in burned and unburned stands of conifer in winter in Yellowstone National Park, chuckwalla lizard distribution limits in North America, California Beechey Ground squirrel and Dusky Footed woodrat mass and energy requirements and activity patterns on the landscape, their predator prey interactions with a rattlesnake, Crotalus viridis, and shifts in that food web structure due to topographic and vegetative variation. We illustrate how different scales of data/observation provide different pieces of information that may collectively define the real distributions of a species. We then use sensitivity analyses of energetic models to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of changes in core temperature (fever) global climate (increased air temperature under a global warming scenario) and vegetation cover (deforestation) on winter survival of elk, the geographic distribution of chuckwallas and the activity overlap of predator and prey species within a subset of commonly observed species in a terrestrial food web. Variation in slope and aspect affect the spatial variance in solar radiation incident on the ground, hence ground surface temperature, at the same elevation, same hourly 2 m air temperatures, and wind speeds. We illustrate visually how spatial effects and landscape heterogeneity make statistical descriptions of animal responses problematic, since multiple distributions of their responses to climate, topography, and vegetation on the landscape can yield the same descriptive statistics, especially at high (30 m) resolution. This preliminary analysis suggests that the model has far-reaching implications for hypothesis testing in ecology at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.",0
"We measured the concentrations of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) in the marine boundary layer and surface waters of the Atlantic Ocean from similar to 50 degrees N to similar to 50 degrees S during the Atlantic Meridional Transect expedition (AMT-7) in 1998. The cruise track transects a variety of meteorological and oceanographic regimes. Unusually high mixing ratios of atmospheric CH4 were observed in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere, coinciding with globally high levels of CH4 associated with the El Nino event of 1998. Atmospheric N2O remained nearly invariable during the expedition, with only a small hemispheric difference (0.82 ppb). Throughout the cruise, these gases were saturated or supersaturated in the water. The coastal region was observed to be a significant source of CH4, while upwelling regions acted as strong N2O emission sources. We estimated the global oceanic emission of CH4 to be 0.6-2 Tg a(-1), comparable to previous estimates from basin-wide observations. However, our estimate turns out to be similar to 10 times lower than the value in the 1990 to 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, which essentially all relied on the estimate by Ehhalt (1974). A bias toward high CH4 saturation anomalies is probably responsible for the overestimation of the marine CH4 source in the IPCC reports. The CH4 saturation anomaly in the ocean appears to have remained constant over an interval of 20 years in spite of the increase of atmospheric CH4, suggesting that the increase of the surface water temperature driven by global warming may be a major factor. Meanwhile, the N2O emission from the ocean, estimated in the present study to be 0.9-7 Tg N a(-1), is similar to 3 times lower than the value in the recent IPCC report [Denman et al., 2007], implying either weak upwelling activity or low amounts of dissolved N2O in upwelling subsurface waters, or both, in the Atlantic.",0
"The assessment to vulnerability of the water supply system needs several modeling tools and cases to simulate. A decision-support tool which integrates the common procedures of impact assessment of climate change, downscaling, weather generation, hydrological model, and interface for linking system dynamics model is proposed here. In this study, the impact of climatic change and growing water demand to the water supply system in Touchien river basin in Taiwan was derived. The vulnerability for the current water supply system was estimated for present and future conditions. The result demonstrated that the water supply system could meet the water demand in Touchien river basin but might be subjected to serious water shortage due to climatic change and expanded water demand. Results are expected to give the authorized government sectors a hint for instituting water policy and implementing allocation measures for irrigational water.",0
"Background, aim, and scope In order to apply the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) to products or services, specific rules [Product Category Rules (PCR)] have to be issued to ensure comparability among different declarations within the same service group. The aim of the present study is to describe the reasons leading to each choice in the development of PCR applied to Collecting and Treatment Service of Municipal Wastewater and to evaluate, through life cycle analysis (LCA), their influence on the potential environmental impact of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), analysed as a case study. Specific data were collected during the year 2003 from an Italian active sludge treatment plant with separate wastewater and sludge treatment lines. Materials and methods The PCR 2005:5 (Collecting and treatment service of municipal wastewater (MWW). Product group/service type: refuse disposal, sanitation and similar activities, NACE code:90) document was prepared by the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering ""G.B. Bonino"" (University of Genoa, Italy). This PCR was tested on the Collection and Treatment Service of Municipal Wastewater in a wastewater treatment plant located in Savona, Italy (Consorzio per la Depurazione delle Acque di Scarico). The PCR 2005:5 document was issued in an open and participatory process between companies and organizations having good knowledge of the specific environmental aspects of the service to be included in the EPD (R) system. PCR, LCA, and EPD studies were developed according to the document ""Requirements for an International EPD Scheme"" (EU funded LIFE Env 2003 program, INTEND Project, www.intendproject.net). Results The following LCA-based information was considered in preparing the PCR: definition of service type, definition of functional unit, choice and description of system boundaries, choice of cutoff criteria, choice of allocation rules, description of quality requirements for data, choice of selected LCI results or other selected parameters for description of environmental performance to be included in the declaration, description of parameters contributing to each preset category, description of specific information to be included in the use stage of the declaration, other environmental information. Ecotoxicity characterization factors, evaluated by the model Uniform System for the Evaluation of Substances (USES-LCA), was added to the PCR as an Annex. The potential environmental impacts of the considered case study were evaluated separately for the following phases: sewer net and plant construction, sewer net and plant management, sludge management. Alternative sludge management techniques were investigated. Discussion PCR of Collecting and Treatment Service of Municipal Wastewater (MWW) was prepared in an open and participatory process between companies and organizations having in-depth knowledge of the specific environmental aspects of the service, in order to safeguard the provision and input of appropriate product-specific knowledge from relevant companies and branch organizations. The main problems characterizing the open consultation regarded are functional unit, system boundaries, boundary in time, parameters to be declared, and other information. Conclusions The annual amount of treated wastewater was considered as a functional unit. In order to evaluate water quality aspects, the request for additional information [biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrient removal] was added to the PCR document. These characteristics aim to complete the lack of information about wastewater quality due to the use of a fixed amount of wastewater as a functional unit. The following parameters were identified: resources use (use of nonrenewable resources, use of renewable resources, water consumption, electricity consumption), pollutant emissions as potential environmental impact (global warming, acidification, ozone depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, eutrophication), and new standard parameters (fresh aquatic ecotoxicity, fresh sediment ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, marine sediment ecotoxicity). The reference model used for the calculation of toxicity potentials was the global nested multimedia fate, exposure and effects model USES-LCA. The comparison of the LCA results obtained for the considered life cycle phases shows that sewer net and plant construction have less than 10% of the total impacts for all the considered categories. Plant management has a higher impact with respect to sewer net and sludge management. In general, sludge treatment for agricultural land application has a lower impact than its treatment in landfill, but the specific results depend on the impact categories. Recommendations and perspectives One of the most important properties of EPDs is that they provide possibilities to add up and accumulate information along the supply chain as well as to make comparisons between declarations with regard to the environmental performance of products and services. Therefore, the PCR 2005:5 document has been prepared to ensure comparability between declarations within collecting and treatment service of municipal wastewater. However, a new revised version of these rules has to be prepared according to the newly published ISO standard for EPD (ISO 14025) and to the incoming revision document of the international EPD (R) system.",0
"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) was grown for two consecutive seasons at Maricopa, AZ, USA, using the free-air CO, enrichment (FACE) approach to investigate evapotranspiration of this C4 plant at ample and limited water supplies. Crop evapotranspiration (ET) was measured using two CO2 concentrations (control, c. 370 mu mol mol(-1); FACE, ambient +200 mu mol mol(-1)) and two irrigation treatments (well watered and water-limited). Volumetric soil water content was measured before and after each irrigation using neutron scattering techniques. Averaged over both years, elevated CO2 reduced cumulative ET by 10% when plants were given ample water and by 4% under severe drought stress. Water-use efficiency based on grain yield (WUE-G) increased, due to CO2 enrichment, by 9% and 19% in wet and dry plots, respectively; based on total biomass, water-use efficiency (WUE-B) increased by 16% and 17% in wet and dry plots, respectively. These data suggest that in the future high-CO2 environment, water requirements for irrigated sorghum will be lower than at present, while dry-land productivity will increase, provided global warming is minimal.",0
"The Upper Cretaceous Cenomanian/Turonian (C/T) boundary represents the most significant thermal climatic event in the Mesozoic, and it has been well-studied. Here we present a relatively new approach for providing both independent, climate-based cyclostratigraphic analysis and correlation among C/T sections. We have collected samples for bulk (initial) low-field magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurement and high-resolution inorganic geochemical analyses from two C/T sequences: (1) the well-defined, C/T Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) located at Lake Pueblo, Colorado, and deposited in the Upper Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of North America, and (2) the well-studied marlstone and limestone USGS#1 Portland Core, drilled at Portland, Colorado, similar to 40 km to the west of the C/T GSSP. Comparing the lithostratigraphy, chemostratigraphy, and magnetostratigraphic susceptibility (developed from magnetic susceptibility (MS) data) indicates that the USGS#1 Portland Core closely compares with the C/T GSSP sequence using any of the three measures, demonstrating that intervals collected and sampled from these two sequences are highly correlated. A preliminary magnetostratigraphic susceptibility zonation for the C/T boundary is presented to which other MS work can be compared. Fourier Transform (FT) analysis of the MS data from the GSSP, when compared with previous FT work using geochemical analysis of Portland core samples shows close similarities to the GSSP, with Milankovitch eccentricity, obliquity and precession bands well-defined in both data sets. Using this result, we assign relative ages to the intervals sampled and evaluate changes in absolute sediment accumulation rates through the C/T boundary interval. We show that while sediment accumulation rate is relatively high in the upper Cenomanian, a change toward lower accumulation rates in the GSSP section at the C/T boundary is due to reduced productivity following the C/T extinction events that resulted from global warming associated with Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2) that began in the uppermost Cenomanian.

"It is becoming increasingly clear that stress and metabolic signalling networks interact and that this interaction is important in plant responses to herbivory, pathogen attack, drought, cold, heat and osmotic stresses including salinity. At the interface between these two major signalling systems are the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and signalling factors including protein kinases and transcription factors. This briefing reviews links between ABA, stress and sugar signalling, focusing on the roles of sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases (SnRKs), SnRK1-activating protein kinases (SnAKs), calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and ABA response element binding proteins (AREBPs, which are transcription factors). Links between stress and nitrogen / amino acid signalling are also described, including the roles of a protein kinase called general control non-derepressible (GCN)-2 in regulating protein synthesis through phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of translation initiation factor-2 (eIF2 alpha) in response not only to decreases in amino acid levels but also to a range of stresses. Evidence of a link between sugar and amino acid signalling is explored, with nitrate reductase being a target for regulation by both SnRK1 and GCN2 through different mechanisms; possible links between SnRK1 and GCN2 via a pathway including the protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR)-1 are described. The significance of these interactions to the concept of signalling networks as opposed to simple cascades and pathways, and the importance of the subject in the context of the predicted increase in severity and range of stresses that plants will have to withstand as a result of global climate change are discussed.",0
"Sea level is a key variable in the context of global climate change. Climate-induced variability is expected to affect not only the mean sea level but also the amplitude and phase of its seasonal cycle. This study addresses the changes in the amplitude and phase of the annual cycle of coastal sea level in the extra-tropical North Atlantic. The physical causes of these variations are explored by analysing the association between fluctuations in the annual amplitude of sea level and in ancillary parameters [atmospheric pressure, sea-surface temperature and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index]. The annual cycle is extracted through autoregressive decomposition, in order to be able to separate variations in seasonality from long-term interannual variations in the mean. The changes detected in the annual sea level cycle are regionally coherent, and related to changes in the analysed forcing parameters. At the northern sites, fluctuations in the annual amplitude of sea level are associated with concurrent changes in temperature, while atmospheric pressure is the dominant influence for most of the sites on the western boundary. The state of the NAO influences the annual variability in the Southern Bight, possibly through NAO-related changes in wind stress and ocean circulation.",0
"A generalised linear model was used to predict climatically suitable habitat for the golden bowerbird (Prionodura newtonia De Vis), an endemic species of the Wet Tropics of North Queensland. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter and mean precipitation of the wettest quarter were found to be the best habitat predictors. For independent validation data, accuracy was 67% (Kappa statistic, n = 30). Past, and future habitats suitable to the golden bowerbird were mapped by altering the temperature and precipitation input to the model. In the current climate, total potential habitat is estimated to be 1564 km(2), occurring as a number of separate patches with distinct bowerbird subpopulations. Past habitat was most limiting, 406 km(2), during the Holocene climatic optimum (c. 5000-3600 YBP, + 2 degreesC and + 50% rainfall relative to today). With future warming, assuming a 10% decrease in rainfall, potential habitat is reduced to 582 km(2) (1 degreesC warming), 163 km(2) (2 degreesC warming) and 37 km(2) (3 degreesC warming). Thus, global warming in the coming decades is likely to be a significant threat to the survival of this and similar upland and highland species in the tropics.

"Coastal biogeochemical cycles are expected to be affected by global warming. By means of a mesocosm experiment, the effect of increased water temperature on the biogeochemical cycles of coastal sediments affected by organic-matter enrichment was tested, focusing on the carbon, sulfur, and iron cycles. Nereis diversicolor was used as a model species to simulate macrofaunal bioirrigation activity in natural sediments. Although bioirrigation rates of N. diversicolor were not temperature dependent, temperature did have a major effect on the sediment metabolism. Under organic-enrichment conditions, the increase in sediment metabolism was greater than expected and occurred through the enhancement of anaerobic metabolic pathway rates, mainly sulfate reduction. There was a twofold increase in sediment metabolism and the accumulation of reduced sulfur. The increase in the benthic metabolism was maintained by the supply of electron acceptors through bioirrigation and as a result of the availability of iron in the sediment. As long as the sediment buffering capacity toward sulfides is not surpassed, an increase in temperature might promote the recovery of organic-enriched sediments by decreasing the time for mineralization of excess organic matter.",0
"P>The ubiquitous transition of plant communities across slope aspects is a well-described, but rarely tested, ecological dynamic. Aspect position is often used as a proxy for microclimate changes in moisture, light and temperature, but these abiotic drivers are seldom decoupled and very rarely manipulated across slope aspects. To investigate the mechanisms and demographic stages driving the observed distribution patterns of two woodland herbs in the southeastern USA, seeds and adults were transplanted across north- and south-facing slopes, and moisture and light were experimentally manipulated. Stage- and species-specific abiotic responses resulted in similar landscape-level patterning for Hexastylis arifolia and Hepatica nobilis, but the underlying abiotic drivers were unique. Adult rather than seed survival best explained the natural distributions across slope aspects, and Hexastylis arifolia was limited by higher temperature, whereas Hepatica nobilis was limited by lower soil moisture. The stage- and species-specific responses indicated that the use of slope aspect to explain plant distributions not only obfuscates explanatory mechanisms, but probably undermines the portability of results. As abiotic drivers, not topographical proxies, are projected to shift with global climate change, distribution research requires direct abiotic data in association with key demographic stages rather than topographical proxies.",0
"The coupling between leaf structure and function is illustrated with reference to two examples, the C(4) photosynthetic pathway and leaf pubescence. A distinction is made between function and functional significance. The latter is defined as the role, significance or consequence of a structure, whereas the former is more simply the action that a structure is capable of performing. Using the two examples, four generalizations are made concerning the relationships between structure, function and functional significance: the functional significance of leaf structure is environment-dependent; the relationship between functional significance and structure is sometimes non-intuitive; functional equivalency means that there is often more than one 'solution' to the same 'constraint'; and the consequences of leaf structure can exert profound effects at levels of organization beyond those of the individual organism and may play a critical role in determining community structure and function, through interactions with other species and trophic levels. The importance of understanding the consequences in variation in leaf structure at the global scale is illustrated with reference to the issue of global climate change.",0
" The circulation of the stratosphere, and its influence on the trace constituent distribution, is an important component of the climate system, which must be included in simulations of global climate change. However, the ability to simulate a dominant stratospheric phenomenon, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in equatorial zonal wind, is an outstanding challenge in climate modeling. Although confined to the tropics, the QBO affects the circulation and the interannual variability of the entire stratosphere, parts of the mesosphere and possibly also of the troposphere. Here we show that the QBO is successfully simulated in a general circulation model (GCM) of the newest generation. Key factors are a sufficient spatial resolution, a realistic simulation of tropical convection, and the consideration of the effects of gravity waves. From this simulation it is inferred that a broad spectrum of atmospheric waves is necessary to generate the QBO in the model.",0
"The life and work of Svante Arrhenius provides an interesting window on changes in the role of science in society. One hundred years ago, Arrhenius too served as science adviser to government, and he emphasized the importance of internationalism. World War I ruptured the social relations of science, and marked the beginning of a complex intertwining of research with the realm of politics. This paper considers Arrhenius' response to this trend, and asks what he would have thought of today's situation when climatology has become a megascience. Some hints of a possible answer are given against the background of a review of Arrhenius' ideas on method, and his Darwinian perspective on the growth of scientific knowledge. In the course of this, the author makes some observations on how policy determination of scientific agendas introduces an organized social dimension, where the drive for consensus may contradict the traditional ideal of a ''Darwinian struggle of hypotheses'', Arrhenius advocated. At the same time it is noted how the traditional ideal of science as neutral ''truth speaking to power'' is constantly being resuscitated, among others by the leading echelon of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is suggested that the social dynamics of global-climate-change-science (or ''greenhouse research'') may be understood in terms of a model of mutually reinforcing credibility cycles, linking science and politics.",0
"A new temperature reconstruction with decadal resolution covering the last two millennia is presented for the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere (90-30 degrees N). utilizing many palaeo-temperature proxy records never previously included in any large-scale temperature reconstruction The amplitude of the reconstructed temperature variability on centennial time-scales exceeds 0 6 degrees C This reconstruction is the first to show a distinct Roman Warm Period c AD 1-300, reaching up to the 1961-1990 mean temperature level, followed by the Dark Age Cold Period c AD 300-800 The Medieval Warm Period is seen c AD 800-1300 and the Little Ice Age is clearly visible c AD 1300-1900. followed by a rapid temperature increase in the twentieth century The highest average temperatures m the reconstruction are encountered in the mid to late tenth century and the lowest in the late seventeenth century Decadal mean temperatures Scent to have reached or exceeded the 1961-1990 mean temperature level during substantial pails of the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period The temperature of the last two decades, however, is possibly higher than during any previous time in the past two millennia, although this is only Seen in the instrumental temperature data and not in the multi-proxy reconstruction itself Our temperature reconstruction agrees well with the reconstructions by Moberg et al (2005) and Mann et al (2008) with regard to the amplitude of the variability as well as the timing of warm and cold periods, except for the period c AD 300-800, despite significant differences in both data coverage and methodology",0
"Climate-induced changes on habitats are likely to have impacts on staging, stopover ecology and fuelling in migratory birds. The effects of these changes on migratory birds are very speculative due to the lack of detailed studies and the uncertainty in climate models with respect to geographical patterns of changes but pronounced regional and species-specific differences are likely. Terrestrial birds and those using inland wetlands are likely to face more pronounced environmental challenges during migration than coastal migrants. Staging migrants may suffer from deteriorating habitats but they may, on the other hand, be able to counteract adverse conditions owing to considerable plasticity in their migratory performance.",0
"The steep environmental gradients of mountains result in the juxtaposition of diverse vegetation associations with narrow ecotones because life zones are compressed. Variation in geologic substrate, landforms, and soils, in combination with steep environmental gradients, create habitat diversity across spatial scales from 10(6) ha to <10 m(2). This leads to higher biodiversity in a smaller space than in landscapes with less topographic variation. Mountains are often considered to be refuges for biological diversity at the regional scale, although variation in landscape features creates refuges at a fine scale as well. Mountains should also be considered a source of biological diversity, because they provide the germplasm for migration into lowland areas following glacial recession. Many taxa are distributed over a broad range of elevations andhabitats, which maximizes the potential to respond to environmental perturbations. Reorganization of species distribution and abundance as a result of climatic change may be impacted considerably by human-caused fragmentation of landscape features, especially at lower elevations. This paper uses palaeoecological and biogeographical data to investigate the spatial and temporal vegetation dynamics of a steep maritime range, the Olympic Mountains (USA). The role of resource management in protecting vegetation in a fragmented landscape is discussed, with emphasis on how to address uncertainties such as climatic change.",0
"Global environmental changes observed during recent decades are likely to have had an impact on the distribution of species. Currently, silver fir (Abies alba) is becoming established in the subalpine forests of the west central Alps at elevations higher than 2000 m a.s.l.; prior to the 1970s its upper altitudinal limit was 2000 m. Several hypotheses could explain this recent expansion of the upper tree-limit. Silver fir regeneration could be linked (1) to land-use changes or (2) to current climatic warming. Using dendrochronology, the age structure of 31 forest plots containing at least one silver fir was examined in order to elucidate the population dynamics of subalpine communities. This allowed us to decipher the timing of fir regeneration in relation to the mean age of the stands examined and of the other tree-canopy species present. The majority of the firs germinated sporadically since 1950, before the regional temperature increase. The pattern of fir recruitment did not appear to relate to altitude, but followed a pattern characteristic of secondary succession. The age structures identified showed an exponential increase in tree-density during the 20th century; the stands were first dominated by Larix decidua during the 18th and 19th centuries, and then by Pinus cembra during the 20th century. In most stands, fir regeneration occurred after Larix and before P. cembra dominated, following a similar pattern to Picea abies regeneration. The number of local inhabitants and temperature both exhibited a negative relationship with fir tree recruitment, thus supporting the land-use change hypothesis. There has been a significant upward shift of the altitudinal range of fir, amounting to an increase of about 300 m since 1950. This followed the abandonment of low-productivity land. This trend is likely to continue during the 21st century, because of new agricultural and forestry practices which involve limited intervention in low-productivity areas and may be because of the effects of global warming.

"We examine changes in the static stability of the midlatitude troposphere in simulations of global warming using 21 coupled climate models in the AR4 archive. The dry static stability within the midlatitudes exhibits a robust increase in the simulations, with upper tropospheric warming outpacing the lower troposphere by approximately 2 K. The increase in stability is especially evident in the summer season, and is more prominent in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern. The moist static stability is largely unchanged, on the other hand, showing that moist convection plays a dominant role in determining the temperature structure of the midlatitudes. We compare bulk measures of the stability with changes in meridional gradients for each individual model simulation, and find that moist theories work well in predicting the stability with the primary exception of the Northern Hemisphere summer, where enhanced surface warming over land reduces the increase in stability.",0
"We propose a hypothesis to explain the very abrupt terminations that end most of the glacial episodes. During the last glaciation, the buildup and southerly expansion of large continental ice-sheets in the Northern Hemisphere and extensive cover of sea ice in the N. Pacific and the N. Atlantic imposed a much more zonal climatic circulation system than exists today. We hypothesize that this, in combination with the frigid (dry) polar air led to a significant decrease in freshwater runoff into the Arctic Ocean. In addition the freshwater contribution of the fresher Pacific water was completely eliminated by the emergence of the Bering Strait (sill depth 50 m). As the Arctic freshwater input was depleted, regions of the Arctic Ocean lost surface stability and eventually overturned, bringing warmer deep water to the surface where it melted the overlying sea ice. This upwelled water was quickly cooled and sank as newly formed deep water. For sustained overturn events, such as might have occurred during the peak of very large glacial periods (i.e. the last glacial maximum), the voluminous deep water formed would eventually overflow into the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic necessitating an equally voluminous rate of return flow of warmer surface waters from the North Atlantic thus breaking down the Arctic's zonal isolation, melting the expansive NA sea ice cover and initiating oceanic heating of the atmosphere over the ice-sheets bordering the NA. We suggest that the combined effect of these overturn-induced events in concert with a Milankovitch warming cycle, was sufficient to drive the system to a termination. We elaborate on this proposed sequence of events, using the model for the formation of the Weddell Sea polynya as proposed by Martinson et al. (1981) and various, albeit sparse, data sets from the circum-Arctic region to apply and evaluate this hypothesis to the problem of glacial terminations.",0
"A novel dry etching process for amorphous silicon (a-Si) and tungsten (W) for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber cleaning has been performed by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) O-2 plasma employing a solid-material evaporation system where fluorocarbon species are produced from fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) by CO2 laser evaporation for preventing global warming. This process enables us to realize etching of materials without using any perfluorocompound (PFC) feed gases which have a high global warming potential (GWP). Etching characteristics together with diagnostics of the F atom density, CFx (x = 1-3) radical densities, electron density and temperature have been investigated as functions of pressure. As a result, it was found that etching rates of a-Si and W films were determined based on the F atom density, ion flux and ion bombardment energy. Furthermore, etching rates of a-Si and W films increased by heating the fluorocarbon species before introducing them into the plasma reactor. Thus, high rates of etching of a-Si and W films were successfully achieved by this novel etching process compared with conventional etching using ECR plasma with CF4/O-2 feed gases.",0
"Global climate and atmospheric changes may interact in their effects on the diversity and composition of natural communities. We followed responses of an annual grassland to three years of all possible combinations of experimentally elevated CO(2) (+300, muL/L), warming (+80 W/m(2), + similar to1degreesC), nitrogen deposition (+7 g N.m(-2).yr(-1)),and precipitation (+50%). Responses of the 10 most common plant species to global changes and to interannual variability were weak but sufficiently consistent within functional groups to drive clearer responses at the functional group level. The dominant functional groups (annual grasses and forbs) showed distinct production and abundance responses to individual global changes. After three years, N deposition suppressed plant diversity, forb production, and forb abundance in association with enhanced grass production. Elevated precipitation enhanced plant diversity, forb production, and forb abundance but affected grasses little. Warming increased forb production and abundance but did not strongly affect diversity or grass response. Elevated CO(2) reduced diversity with little effect on relative abundance or production of forbs and grasses. Realistic combinations of global changes had small diversity effects but more marked effects on the relative dominance of forbs and grasses. The largest change in relative functional group abundance (+50% forbs) occurred under the combination of elevated CO(2) + warming + precipitation, which will likely affect much of California in the future. Strong interannual variability in diversity, individual. species abundances, and functional group abundances indicated that in our system, (1) responses after three years were not constrained by lags in community response, (2) individual species were more sensitive to interannual variability and extremes than to mean changes in environmental and resource conditions, and (3) simulated global changes interacted with interannual variability to produce responses of varying magnitude and even direction among years. Relative abundance of forbs, the most speciose group in the community, ranged after three years from >30% under elevated CO(2) + warming + precipitation to <12% under N deposition: While opposing production responses at the ecosystem level by different functional groups may buffet responses such as net primary production (NPP) change, these shifts in relative dominance could influence ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and,NPP via differences between grasses and forbs in tissue chemistry, allocation, phenology, and productivity.",0
"Changes in land use can affect soil organic matter contents and fertility and also atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming through soil respiration. We compared total and microbial C, N and P pools and C and N metabolism in sandy loam soils (Typic Udivitrands) under indigenous broadleaf-podocarp forest, grazed introduced pasture and 19-yr old Pinus radiata D. Don forest (planted on previous pasture) in New Zealand. Total and microbial C and N declined consistently with profile depth (except for total N in L and FH samples), and in comparable depths of mineral soil (to 20 cm) tended to be lower in the pine than in the other systems. Total P, organic P and extractable inorganic P concentrations at comparable depths were, in contrast, lowest in the indigenous forest. Microbial P concentrations did not differ significantly between the different systems. Microbial C-to-microbial N ratios differed little among soil profile depths and ecosystems. In 0-10 cm depth mineral soil, CO2-C production, metabolic quotients (qCO(2) values) and net N mineralization were all highest in the pasture samples. Net nitrification was high in the pine and pasture samples, but much lower in the indigenous forest samples; nitrate-N was, however, consistently present in streamwater from all three ecosystems. Changes in total C and microbial C and N pools on an area basis to 20 cm depth mineral soil were greatest after conversion of the indigenous forest to pasture; total N contents were, however, as high in the pasture as in the forest and net N mineralization was highest in the pasture. On this area basis, changes in total C contents were small after conversion of pasture to pines, although the distribution within the soil profile did differ considerably between the pine and pasture systems.

"The objective of this work was to evaluate different operational strategies for photobioreactors to remove carbon dioxide using the cyanobacteria, Aphanothece microscopica Nageli. Two types of reactor configuration, bubble column and airlift were evaluated under three different operational conditions to treat air containing 15% carbon dioxide: simple operation, air recirculation and two sequential reactors. The results obtained showed that the reactor configuration and the operational mode were both determinant criteria for the performance of photobioreactors in the biological conversion of carbon dioxide. Operations with air recirculation showed possibilities for use in small-scale operations, but two-stage sequential photobioreactors (elimination capacity and removal efficiency of 12.217 g(carbon)/m(reactor)(3) day and 52.5%, respectively) were shown to be the operational mode with greatest potential for application on an industrial scale by the increased removal efficiency.

"A methodology combining ecological modelling with geographical information analysis and remote sensing was employed to determine the effects of sea-level rise in estuarine salt marshes, using the Tagus estuary (Portugal) as a case study. The development of salt marsh vegetation was simulated separately for C3 and C4 plants, using a combined biogeochemical and demographic model. This simulation, which provided small-scale (m(2)) results of annual above-ground primary production, was upscaled to the whole salt marsh area, using bathymetry data, remote sensing and Geographic information System (GIS) for assessing vegetation cover and determining areal distribution of C3 and C4 vegetation. Based on IPCC data, several sea-level rise scenarios were considered, and the coupled ecological model-GIS were applied to these in order to determine changes in global salt marsh productivity. The results indicate that the salt marshes of the mesotidal estuaries such as the Tagus are susceptible to sea-level rise only in a worst case scenario, which is more likely to occur if the terms set out by the Kyoto protocol are not met by several industrialised nations. The low vulnerability of salt marshes supports the suggestion that areas with high tidal ranges are less vulnerable to sea level change, due to greater sediment transport and accretion. Nevertheless, the precautionary principle should always be applied by coastal planners, due to the great uncertainty surrounding forecasts of sea-level rise. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Models of complex systems can capture much useful information but can be difficult to apply to real-world decision-making because the type of information they contain is often inconsistent with that required for traditional decision analysis. New approaches, which use inductive reasoning over large ensembles of computational experiments, now make possible systematic comparison of alternative policy options using models of complex systems. This article describes Computer-Assisted Reasoning, an approach to decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty that is ideally suited to applying complex systems to policy analysis. The article demonstrates the approach on the policy problem of global climate change, with a particular focus on the role of technology policies in a robust, adaptive strategy for greenhouse gas abatement.",0
"This paper describes the modeling of climate change impact on runoff across southeast Australia using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model SIMHYD and presents the results and assesses the robustness of the modeling approach. The future climate series is obtained by scaling the historical series, informed by 15 global climate models (GCMs), to reflect a 0.9 degrees C increase in global average surface air temperature, using a daily scaling method that considers changes in the future mean seasonal rainfall and potential evapotranspiration as well as in the daily rainfall distribution. The majority of the modeling results indicate that there will be less runoff in southeast Australia in the future. However, there is considerable uncertainty, with the results ranging from a 17% decrease to a 7% increase in the mean annual runoff averaged across the study area for the 0.9 degrees C global warming. The model assessments indicate that the modeling approach is generally robust and can be used to estimate the climate impact on runoff. The modeled mean annual runoff is generally within 10-20% of the observed runoff. The modeling results for an independent test period are only slightly poorer than the calibration period, indicating that a satisfactorily calibrated rainfall-runoff model can be used to estimate runoff for another climate period. The modeled impact on various runoff characteristics as estimated by two rainfall-runoff models investigated here differ by less than 10%, which is relatively small compared to the range of modeled runoff results using rainfall projections from different GCMs.",0
"This communication aims to identify and utilize persistent features of global atmospheric temperature for predicting underlying fluctuating phenomena. A graphical method, Loess plot is used to show the presence of some degree of non-linearity in global temperature dynamics. Here we propose to split the average global temperature data set into three scale invariant temperature series on the basis of Hurst exponent in order to extract useful features of the physical system responsible for temperature anomalies. Global warming dynamics is revealed as possible Martingale and Markov stochastic processes. Different orders of Markov processes are examined for representative adequate models of the phenomenon. The models considered can be used both for short term and long-term temperature forecasts.",0
"Species distribution models, linked to climate projections, are widely used in extinction-risk assessment and conservation planning. However, the degree of confidence that we can place on future climate-change projections depends on global climate-model performance and involves uncertainties that need to be assessed rigorously via climate-model evaluation. Performance assessments are important because the choice of climate model influences projections of species' range movement and extinction risk. A consensus view from the climate modeling community is that no single climate model is superior in its ability to forecast key climatic features. Despite this, the advantages of using multi-model ensemble-averaged climate forecasts to account for climate-model uncertainties have not been recognized by ecologists. Here we propose a method to use a range of skill and convergence metrics to rank commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) according to their skill in reproducing 20-year observed patterns of regional and global climates of interest, and to assess their consistency with other AOGCMs. By eliminating poorly performing models and averaging the remainder with equal weights, we show how downscaled annual multi-climate-model ensemble-averaged forecasts, which have a strong regional focus, can be generated. We demonstrate that: (1) model ranking (match of simulated to observed conditions) differs according to the skill metric used, as well as the climate variable and season considered; (2) although the multi-model averaged result tends to outperform single models at a global scale, at the continental scale at least some models can perform better than the multi-model average; and (3) forecasts for the Australian region, which are often based on a single AOGCM (CSIRO-3.0), show spatial patterns of change that differ noticeably from ensemble-average projections based on a subset of better-performing AOGCMs. Our suggested approach-novel in the ecology discipline-provides a straightforward, consistent, and defensible method for conservation practitioners and natural-resource managers to generate estimates of future climate change at a spatial resolution suitable for biodiversity impact studies.",0
"Many studies suggest that global warming is driving species ranges poleward and toward higher elevations at temperate latitudes, but evidence for range shifts is scarce for the tropics, where the shallow latitudinal temperature gradient makes upslope shifts more likely than poleward shifts. Based on new data for plants and insects on an elevational transect in Costa Rica, we assess the potential for lowland biotic attrition, range-shift gaps, and mountaintop extinctions under projected warming. We conclude that tropical lowland biotas may face a level of net lowland biotic attrition without parallel at higher latitudes (where range shifts may be compensated for by species from lower latitudes) and that a high proportion of tropical species soon faces gaps between current and projected elevational ranges.",0
"Studies of trace gases in the atmosphere, their sources, sinks, and mechanisms of transport, have developed rapidly in the last few decades. This has been driven partly by increasing recognition that particular gases are associated with problems such as acidification, eutrophication, and global warming, but also by the developing enthusiasm for multidisciplinary research in which scientists from many disciplines collaborate to explore biological, geochemical, and atmospheric cycles and to understand how human action disturbs such cycles. Major international programs such as the International Biological Program (IBP) and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) have been very influential in generating and encouraging this new way of working. To answer these complex environmental research questions, scientists have needed to develop new field instrumentation, or at least to modify instruments normally used in the laboratory. Equally, mathematical simulation models are increasingly being used at scales ranging from cellular to global to allow complex computations that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. The papers in this proceedings illustrate some of the exciting developments taking place in the study of the exchange of trace gases between the atmosphere and the land. They describe new understanding of the processes in soils, plants and the atmosphere that control gases important in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, they summarize new techniques and instrumentation that allow field studies at scales ranging from soil grains to landscapes, and they present results of mathematical models that allow us to explore consequences of global changes that may yet come.",0
"This study examined the possibility that genetically based sex-determination mechanisms have evolved to ensure a balanced male/female ratio and that this temperature-independent checkpoint might have been unavailable to long-extinct reptiles, notably the dinosaurs. A review of the literature on molecular and phylogenetic relationships between modes of reproduction and sex determination in extant animals was conducted. Mammals, birds, all snakes and most lizards, amphibians, and some gonochoristic fish use specific sex-determining chromosomes or genes (genetic sex determination, GSD). Some reptiles, however, including all crocodilians studied to date, many turtle and tortoise species, and some lizards, use environmental or temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). We show that various modes of GSD have evolved many times, independently in different orders. Animals using TSD would be at risk of rapid reproductive failure due to a skewed sex ratio favoring males in response to sustained environmental temperature change and favoring the selection of sex-determining genes. The disadvantage to the evolving male sex-determining chromosome, however, is its decay due to nonrecombination and the subsequent loss of spermatogenesis genes. Global temperature change can skew the sex ratio of TSD animals and might have played a significant role in the demise of long-extinct species, notably the dinosaurs, particularly if the temperature change resulted in a preponderance of males. Current global warming also represents a risk for extant TSD species. (C) 2004 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",0
"Tropical meridional ocean heat transport is studied in six coupled ocean-atmosphere models in which atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increased. In the Indo-Pacific, the strength of Subtropical Cells (STCs) changes in response to changes in the trade winds. However, the change is not consistent among models. In contrast, in all models the tropical Indo-Pacific heat transport remains nearly constant over time due to compensation of STC and the horizontal gyre variations. Even under strong atmospheric radiative forcing the tropical Indo-Pacific ocean heat transport trends are determined by changes in circulation, rather than changes in the stratification. Ocean heat transport in the tropical Atlantic responds to weakening of the basin-wide meridional overturning circulation (MOC). The trends in the South Atlantic STC do not affect ocean heat transport.",0
"the red algae Porphyra yezoensis has high commercial and nutritional value; however, its cultivation and product quality are jeopardized by global warming. Screening of high-temperature-tolerant strains would greatly reduce cultivation risks and benefit the Porphyra industry. Single somatic cells isolated enzymatically from the wildtype (WT) blades irradiated by (60)Co-gamma rays were screened at 25 degrees C; one strain, T-17, displayed significant high-temperature resistance. Further culture studies showed that conchospore germlings of T-17 showed 76.2% survival at 23 degrees C and 65.7% survival at 24 degrees C, while the WT conchospore germlings survived at significantly lower percentages of 16.9% and 15%, respectively, over a period of 16 days. Furthermore, T-17 conchospore germlings divided at higher percentages of 100% at both 23 and 24 degrees C compared to the WT conchospores with 99.8% and 88%, respectively. When the 50-day-old F(1) gametophytic blades were transferred from the optimal temperature of 18 degrees C to high temperatures of 23 and 24 degrees C, the T-17 blades sustained growth over a 45-day period without rot, and their mean lengths increased by 20 and 4.2 times, respectively. The mean lengths of WT blades only increased by a factor of 0.6 and 0.4 times and were severely decayed after being cultured for 15 days at high temperatures. The mean wet weights of T-17 blades increased by 418.9 and 195.3 times, but only 7.8 and 4.6 times in WT at 23 and 24 degrees C, respectively. These results indicate that T-17 is superior to WT in growth and high-temperature tolerance, which may offer a new cultivar for the nori industry as a high-temperature-resistant strain to counteract the effects of global warming.",0
"The biogeochemical carbon cycle, which plays an undeniable role in global climate change, is defined both by the size of carbon reservoirs (such as the atmosphere, biomass, soil and bedrock) and the exchange between them of various mineral and organic carbon forms. Among these carbon forms, fossil organic carbon (FOC) (i.e., the ancient organic matter stored in sedimentary rocks) is widely observed in modem environments but is not included in the supergene carbon budget. Using a digitized map of the world and an existing model of CO2 consumption associated with rock weathering, we establish the global distribution of FOC stored in the first meter of sedimentary rocks and a first estimation of annual FOC delivery to the modem environment resulting from chemical weathering of these rocks. Results are given for the world's 40 major river basins and extended to the entire continental surface. With a mean value of I 100 10(9) t, mainly controlled by shale distribution, the global FOC stock is significant and comparable to that of soil organic carbon (1500 10(9) t). The annual chemical delivery of FOC, estimated at 43 10(6) t yr(-1) and controlled by the areal distribution of shales and runoff is of the same order of magnitude as the FOC output flux to oceans. Chemical weathering of bedrock within the Amazon basin produces one-quarter of the total global flux of FOC derived from chemical weathering, and thus is expected to govern FOC release on a global scale. These results raise important questions concerning the role of FOC in the modem carbon cycle as well as the origin and the budget of carbon in soils and rivers. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Tailoring the chemical environment in plasmas by addition of reactive gases to affect byproduct formation has been demonstrated to reduce perfluorocompound (PFC) emissions. Perfluorocompound emissions from dielectric etch processes are reduced by oxygen addition, which reduces polymerization and increases etch rates, primarily by affecting the fluorine or carbon in the plasma, and secondarily, by affecting resist erosion. Oxygen or water vapor introduced upstream of plasma abatement devices reduces PFC reformation by preferentially combining with carbon and fluorine-containing radicals to form thermodynamically favorable byproducts that are non- or low-global warming. Introducing oxygen to low-k chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber clean processes also reduces PFC emissions, primarily by reducing CF4 by forming thermodynamically stable CO and CO2. Analogously, adjusting the fuel or the oxidizer flow in fuel-fired abatement devices provides a higher flame temperature where thermal cracking of higher molecular weight low-k CVD organosilicon precursors can more readily occur, allowing the carbon-rich precursors to more completely oxidize.",0
"Hydrological processes in high altitude mountainous regions differ from those in more temperate regions, primarily due to such influences as cold temperatures, large and rapid change in surface energy balance during snowmelt, a long period at low-temperature environmental condition and the existence of permafrost. A physically based, semi-distributed water balance model to quantitatively simulate the hydrological processes and stream flow, as well as to estimate the potential consequences of projected global warming on stream Row for such high altitude mountainous regions was constructed. Distributed meteorological data from the interpolation of the point measurements by means of a digital elevation model (DEM) of the basin, such as air temperature, precipitation, snowfall ratio, wind speed, etc., have been used as model input. Several other hydrological parameters, such as soil moisture content and evapotranspiration, which are essential in simulation of river runoff in a water balance state, were estimated by the combination of Landsat TM and a DEM with the utilization of the distributed meteorological data. The model uses only a few crucial parameters for calibration, and the model structure is based upon estimating the stream flow components. Simulated results of spatially distributed soil moisture content, evapotranspiration and monthly discharge yield reasonable agreement, both spatially and temporally, to the field observations or the estimated results by the other approaches. This physically based model has the potential to project stream flow under the possible climate scenarios. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0
"Global warming and a changing precipitation regime could have a profound impact on ecosystem carbon fluxes, especially in arid and semiarid grasslands where water is limited. A field experiment manipulating temperature and precipitation has been conducted in a temperate steppe in northern China since 2005. A paired, nested experimental design was used, with increased precipitation as the primary factor and warming simulated by infrared radiators as the secondary factor. The results for the first 2 yr showed that gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) was higher than ecosystem respiration, leading to net C sink (measured by net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE) over the growing season in the study site. The interannual variation of NEE resulted from the difference in mean annual precipitation. Experimental warming reduced GEP and NEE, whereas increased precipitation stimulated ecosystem C and water fluxes in both years. Increased precipitation also alleviated the negative effect of experimental warming on NEE. The results demonstrate that water availability plays a dominant role in regulating ecosystem C and water fluxes and their responses to climatic change in the temperate steppe of northern China.",0
"Large rivers of the tropics, many of which have extensive floodplains and deltas, are important in the delivery of nutrients and sediments to marine environments, in methane emission to the atmosphere and in providing ecosystem services associated with their high biological productivity. These ecosystem functions entail biogeochemical processes that will be influenced by climate change. Evidence for recent climate-driven changes in tropical rivers exists, but remains equivocal. Model projections suggest substantial future climate-driven changes, but they also underscore the complex interactions that control landscape water balances, river discharges and biogeochemical processes. The most important changes are likely to involve: (1) aquatic thermal regimes, with implications for thermal optima of plants and animals, rates of microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations, density stratification of water bodies and dissolved oxygen depletion; (2) hydrological regimes of discharge and floodplain inundation, which determine the ecological structure and function of rivers and floodplains and the extent and seasonality of aquatic environments; and (3) freshwater-seawater gradients where rivers meet oceans, affecting the distribution of marine, brackish and freshwater environments and the biogeochemical processing as river water approaches the coastal zone. In all cases, climate change affects biogeochemical processes in concert with other drivers such as deforestation and other land use changes, dams and other hydrological alterations and water withdrawals. Furthermore, changes in riverine hydrology and biogeochemistry produce potential feedbacks to climate involving biogeochemical processes such as decomposition and methane emission. Future research should seek improved understanding of these changes, and long-term monitoring should be extended to shallow waters of wetlands and floodplains in addition to the larger lakes and rivers that are most studied.",0
"Simulations of present and future average regional ozone and PM2.5 concentrations over the United States were performed to investigate the potential impacts of global climate change and emissions on regional air quality using CMAQ. Various emissions and climate conditions with different biogenic emissions and domain resolutions were implemented to study the sensitivity of future air quality trends from the impacts of changing biogenic emissions. A comparison of GEOS-Chem and CMAQ was performed to investigate the effect of downscaling on the prediction of future air quality trends. For ozone, the impacts of global climate change are relatively smaller when compared to the impacts of anticipated future emissions reduction, except for the Northeast area, where increasing biogenic emissions due to climate change have stronger positive effects (increases) to the regional ozone air quality. The combination effect from both climate change and emission reductions leads to approximately a 10% or 5 ppbv decrease of the maximum daily average eight-hour ozone (MDA8) over the Eastern United States. For PM2.5, the impacts of global climate change have shown insignificant effect, where as the impacts of anticipated future emissions reduction account for the majority of overall PM2.5 reductions. The annual average 24-h PM2.5 of the future-year condition was found to be about 40% lower than the one from the present-year condition, of which 60% of its overall reductions are contributed to by the decrease of SO4 and NO3 particulate matters. Changing the biogenic emissions model increases the MDA8 ozone by about 5-10% or 3-5 ppbv in the Northeast area. Conversely, it reduces the annual average PM2.5 by 5% or 0 mu g m(-3) in the Southeast region.",0
"We manipulated air temperature in tussock tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, and determined the consequences for total plant biomass; aboveground net primary production (ANPP), ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools and N uptake, and ecosystem CO, flux. After 3.5 growing seasons, in situ plastic greenhouses that raised air temperature during the growing season had little effect on total biomass, N content, or growing-season N uptake of the major plant and soil pools. Similarly, vascular ANPP and net ecosystem CO, exchange did not change with warming, although net primary production of mosses decreased with warming. Such general lack of response supports the hypothesis that productivity in tundra is constrained by the indirect effects of cold temperatures (e.g., low nutrient availability or short growing-season length) rather than by cold growing-season temperatures per se. Despite no effect on net ecosystem CO, flux, air warming stimulated early-season gross photosynthesis (GP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) throughout the growing season. This increased carbon turnover was probably associated with species-level responses to increased air temperature. Warming increased the aboveground biomass of the overstory shrub, dwarf birch (Betula nana), and caused a significant net redistribution of N from the understory evergreen shrub, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, to B. nana, despite no effects on soil temperature, total plant N, or N availability. Thus, although air warming had no effect on total ecosystem N pools, it did mediate N distribution within the plant community. The early-season stimulation of GP is consistent with warming effects on leaf expansion of dominant shrubs (including B. nana) observed in other studies in tussock tundra. The stimulation of ER probably resulted from maintenance and growth respiration associated with higher aboveground B, nana biomass production and higher root N uptake and/or turnover in the greenhouses. The species responses to warming are consistent with changes in plant species assemblages associated with past warming and suggest that future warming may increase the abundance of B. nana in tussock tundra. We conclude that a 4 degrees C rise in air temperature alone will significantly stimulate carbon turnover in tundra but will have little effect on net carbon balance.",0
"Airborne Poaceae pollen counts are greatly influenced by weather-related parameters, but may also be governed by other factors. Poaceae pollen is responsible for most allergic reactions in the pollen-sensitive population of Galicia (Spain), and it is therefore essential to determine the risk posed by airborne pollen counts. The global climate change recorded over recent years may prompt changes in the atmospheric pollen season (APS). This survey used airborne Poaceae pollen data recorded for four Galician cities since 1993, in order to characterise the APS and note any trends in its onset, length and severity. Pollen sampling was performed using Hirst-type volumetric traps; data were subjected to Spearman's correlation test and regression models, in order to detect possible correlations between different parameters and trends. The APS was calculated using ten different methods, in order to assess the influence of each on survey results. Finally, trends detected for the major weather-related parameters influencing pollen counts over the study period were compared with those recorded over the last 30 years. All four cities displayed a trend towards lower annual total Poaceae pollen counts, lower peak values and a smaller number of days on which counts exceeded 30, 50 and 100 pollen grains/m(3). Moreover, the survey noted a trend towards delayed onset and shorter duration of the APS, although differences were observed depending on the criteria used to define the first and the last day of the APS.",0
"Agricultural application of sewage sludge has been emotionally discussed in the last decades, because the latter contains organic micropollutants with unknown fate and risk potential. In this work, the reuse of anaerobically digested sludge in agriculture is evaluated from an environmental point of view by using Life Cycle Assessment methodology. More specifically, the potential impacts of emerging micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, present in the sludge have been quantified. Four scenarios were considered according to the temperature of the anaerobic digestion (mesophilic or thermophilic) and the sludge retention time (20 or 10 d), and they have been compared with the non-treated sludge. From an environmental point of view, the disposal of undigested sludge is not the most suitable alternative, except for global warming due to the dominance (65-85%) of the indirect emissions associated to the electricity use. Nutrient-related direct emissions dominate the eutrophication category impact in all the scenarios (>74%), although a beneficial impact related to the avoidance of industrial fertilisers production is also quantified (up to 6.7%). In terms of human and terrestrial toxicity, the direct emissions of heavy metals to soil dominate these two impact categories (>70%), and the contribution of other micropollutants is minimal. Moreover, only six (Galaxolide, Tonalide, Diazepam, Ibuprofen, Sulfamethoxazole and 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol) out of the 13 substances considered are really significant since they account for more than 95% of the overall micropollutants impact.

"By use of a coupled ocean-atmosphere-land model, this study explores the changes of water availability, as measured by river discharge and soil moisture, that could occur by the middle of the 21st century in response to combined increases of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols based upon the ""IS92a"" scenario. In addition, it presents the simulated change in water availability that might be realized in a few centuries in response to a quadrupling of CO2, concentration in the atmosphere. Averaging the results over extended periods, the radiatively forced changes, which are very similar between the two sets of experiments, were successfully extracted. The analysis indicates that the discharges from Arctic rivers such as the Mackenzie and Ob' increase by up to 20% (of the pre-Industrial Period level) by the middle of the 21st century and by up to 40% or more in a few centuries. In the tropics, the discharges from the Amazonas and Ganga-Brahmaputra rivers increase substantially. However, the percentage changes in runoff from other tropical and many mid-latitude rivers are smaller, with both positive and negative signs. For soil moisture, the results of this study indicate reductions during much of the year in many semiarid regions of the world, such as the southwestern region of North America, the northeastern region of China, the Mediterranean coast of Europe, and the grasslands of Australia and Africa. As a percentage, the reduction is particularly large during the dry season. From middle to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, soil moisture decreases in Summer but increases in winter.",1
"Rice fields are considered to be among the highest sources of atmospheric methane, an important source of global warming. In order to meet the projected rice needs of the increasing world population, it is estimated that the annual world's rough rice production must increase to 760 million tons (a 65% increase) in the next 30 years. This will increase methane emissions from rice-fields if current technologies are kept. Methane emissions from ricefields are affected by climate, water regime, soil properties, and various cultural practices like irrigation and drainage, organic amendments, fertilization, and rice cultivars. Irrigated rice comprises 50% of the world-harvested rice area and contributes 70% to total rice production. Because of assured flooding during the growing period it is the primary source of methane. Rainfed rice emits less methane due to periods of droughts. Upland rice, being never flooded for a significant period of time, is not a significant source of methane. There is great potential to develop 'no regret' mitigation options that are in accordance with increasing rice production.",1
"A recent study of coupled atmospheric carbon dioxide and the biosphere (Cox et al., 2000, Nature, 408, 184- 187) found alarming sensitivity of next- century atmospheric pCO(2) (and hence planetary temperature) to uncertainties in terrestrial processes. Here we investigate whether there is similar sensitivity associated with uncertainties in the behaviour of the ocean carbon cycle. We investigate this important question using three models of the ocean carbon cycle of varying complexity: (1) a new three- box oceanic carbon cycle model; (2) the HILDA multibox model with high vertical resolution at low latitudes; (3) the Hadley Centre ocean general circulation model (HadOCC). These models were used in combination to assess the quantitative significance (to year 2100 pCO(2)) of potential changes to the ocean stimulated by global warming and other anthropogenic activities over the period 2000- 2100. It was found that an increase in sea surface temperature and a decrease in the mixing rate due to stratification give rise to the greatest relative changes in pCO(2), both being positive feedbacks. We failed to find any comparable large sensitivity due to the ocean.",1
"To examine the synergism of high temperature and sulfide on two dominant tropical seagrass species, a large-scale mesocosm experiment was conducted in which sulfide accumulation rates (SAR) were increased by adding labile carbon (glucose) to intact seagrass sediment cores across a range of temperatures. During the initial 10 d of the 38 d experiment, porewater SAR in cores increased 2- to 3-fold from 44 and 136 mu mol L(-1) d(-1) at 28-29 degrees C to 80 and 308 mu mol L(-1) d(-1) at 34-35 degrees C in Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum cores, respectively. Labile C additions to the sediment resulted in SAR of 443 and 601 mu mol L(-1) d(-1) at 28-29 degrees C and 758 to 1,557 mu mol L(-1) d(-1) at 34-35 degrees C in H. wrightii and T testudinton cores, respectively. Both T testudinum and H. wrightii were highly thermal tolerant, demonstrating their tropical affinities and potential to adapt to high temperatures, While plants survived the 38 d temperature treatments, there was a clear thermal threshold above 33 degrees C where T testudinum growth declined and leaf quantum efficiencies (Fv/Fm) fell below 0.7. At this threshold temperature, H. wrightii maintained shoot densities and leaf quantum efficiencies. Although H. wrigghtii showed a greater tolerance to high temperature, T testudinum had a greater capacity to sustain biomass and short shoots under thermal stress with labile C enrichment, regardless of the fact that sulfide levels in the T testudium cores were 2 times higher than in the H. wrightii cores. Tropical seagrass tolerance to elevated temperatures, predicted in the future with global warming, should be considered in the context of the sediment-plant complex which incorporates the synergism of plant physiological responses and shifts in sulfur biogeochemistry leading to increased plant exposure to sulfides, a known toxin.

"Mechanisms to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) have been gaining momentum as a way to combat global warming, fund forest conservation, and deliver economic benefits to rural populations. However, the economic viability of REDD schemes will depend on the profitability of alternative land uses. Oil palm agriculture has become a major driver of tropical deforestation over the last few decades. Here, we model and compare the profitability of converting forest to oil palm versus conserving it for an REDD project. We show that converting a hectare of forest for palm oil production will be more profitable (yielding net present values of $3,835-$9,630) to land owners than preserving it for carbon credits ($614-$994), which are currently restricted to voluntary carbon markets. Giving REDD credits price parity with carbon credits traded in compliance markets would boost the profitability of avoided deforestation (up to $6,605). Unless post-2012 global climate policies legitimize the trading of carbon credits from avoided deforestation, REDD will not be able to compete with oil palm agriculture or other similarly profitable human activities as an economically attractive land-use option, in which case REDD will not be able to fulfill its primary function of avoiding deforestation.",1
"Coupled models of the atmosphere-ocean and land surface provide important tools for prediction of climate change. The results of experiments carried out at the Hadley Centre, Meteorological Office, in which such models have been used in studies of climate change due to increased levels of greenhouse gas concentrations are described, with particular reference to simulation of climate change in the region of Antarctica. Although, as yet, the ability of such models to represent regional climate change is relatively low, processes in the southern ocean around Antarctica are important for determining the global pattern of transient temperature change as CO2 increases. This is illustrated by results from two experiments. Firstly, an experiment with a high resolution (2.5-degrees x 3.75-degrees) atmospheric model coupled to a simple slab ocean in which the response of climate to an instantaneous doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations was examined, and which showed the largest induced warming to be in the polar regions in winter similar to the results of previous experiments carried out at the Meteorological Office and elsewhere. However, an experiment with a deep ocean model and a (more realistic) 1% per annum increase in greenhouse gas concentrations shows the pattern of global warming to be shifted to give minimum values around Antarctica as a result of deep oceanic mixing processes in the southern ocean, consistent with similar experiments carried out at other centres.",1
"This paper investigates the impact of aerosol forcing uncertainty on the robustness of estimates of the twentieth-century warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Attribution analyses on three coupled climate models with very different sensitivities and aerosol forcing are carried out. The Third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean - Atmosphere GCM (HadCM3), Parallel Climate Model (PCM), and GFDL R30 models all provide good simulations of twentieth-century global mean temperature changes when they include both anthropogenic and natural forcings. Such good agreement could result from a fortuitous cancellation of errors, for example, by balancing too much ( or too little) greenhouse warming by too much ( or too little) aerosol cooling. Despite a very large uncertainty for estimates of the possible range of sulfate aerosol forcing obtained from measurement campaigns, results show that the spatial and temporal nature of observed twentieth-century temperature change constrains the component of past warming attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gases to be significantly greater ( at the 5% level) than the observed warming over the twentieth century. The cooling effects of aerosols are detected in all three models. Both spatial and temporal aspects of observed temperature change are responsible for constraining the relative roles of greenhouse warming and sulfate cooling over the twentieth century. This is because there are distinctive temporal structures in differential warming rates between the hemispheres, between land and ocean, and between mid- and low latitudes. As a result, consistent estimates of warming attributable to greenhouse gas emissions are obtained from all three models, and predictions are relatively robust to the use of more or less sensitive models. The transient climate response following a 1% yr(-1) increase in CO(2) is estimated to lie between 2.2 and 4 K century(-1) (5-95 percentiles).",1
"Climate change is an issue of risk management. The most important causes for concern are not the median projections of future climate change, but the low-probability, high-consequence impacts. Because the policy question is one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, we need not decide today what to do in the future. We need only to decide what to do today, and future decisions can be revised as we learn more. In this study, we use a stochastic version of the DICE-99 model (Nordhaus WD, Boyer J (2000) Warming the world: economic models of global warming. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA) to explore the effect of different rates of learning on the appropriate level of near-term policy. We show that the effect of learning depends strongly on whether one chooses efficiency (balancing costs and benefits) or cost-effectiveness (stabilizing at a given temperature change target) as the criterion for policy design. Then, we model endogenous learning by calculating posterior distributions of climate sensitivity from Bayesian updating, based on temperature changes that would be observed for a given true climate sensitivity and assumptions about errors, prior distributions, and the presence of additional uncertainties. We show that reducing uncertainty in climate uncertainty takes longer when there is also uncertainty in the rate of heat uptake by the ocean, unless additional observations are used, such as sea level rise.",1
"Conservation agriculture can provide a low-cost competitive option to mitigate global warming with reduction or elimination of soil tillage and increase soil organic carbon (SOC). Most studies have evaluated the impact of zero till (ZT) only on surface soil layers (down to 30 cm), and few studies have been performed on the potential for C accumulation in deeper layers (0-100 cm) of tropical and subtropical soils. In order to determine whether the change from conventional tillage (CT) to ZT has induced a net gain in SOC, three long-term experiments (15-26 years) on free-draining Ferralsols in the subtropical region of South Brazil were sampled and the SOC stocks to 30 and 100 cm calculated on an equivalent soil mass basis. In rotations containing intercropped or cover-crop legumes, there were significant accumulations of SOC in ZT soils varying from 5 to 8 Mg ha-1 in comparison with CT management, equivalent to annual soil C accumulation rates of between 0.04 and 0.88 Mg ha- However, the potential for soil C accumulation was considerably increased (varying from 0.48 to 53 Mg ha-1 yr-1) when considering the soil profile down to 100 cm depth. On average the estimate of soil C accumulation to 100 cm depth was 59% greater than that for soil C accumulated to 30 cm. These findings suggest that increasing sampling depth from 30 cm (as presently recommended by the IPCC) to 100 cm, may increase substantially the estimates of potential CO(2) mitigation induced by the change from CT to ZT on the free-draining Ferralsols of the tropics and subtropics. It was evident that that legumes which contributed a net input of biologically fixed N played an important role in promoting soil C accumulation in these soils under ZT, perhaps due to a slow-release of N from decaying surface residues/roots which favored maize root growth.",1
"Amelioration of global warming presents opportunities for urban forests to act as carbon sinks, and thereby could possibly be included in the potential future carbon trade industry. The City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality provided a strategy in 2002 to plant 115,200 indigenous street trees in the period 2002-2008. These trees hold a monetary carbon value in their potential future growth. In order to calculate the carbon sequestration potential, the growth rates of Combretum erythrophyllum, Searsia lancea and Searsia pendulina were determined. Combined species growth regressions of C. erythrophyllum-S. lancea and S. lancea-S. pendulina are also presented. Combretum erythrophyllum has the fastest growth rate while those of S. lancea and S. pendulina are slower. The results from growth regression relationships were used in a generic allometric biomass regression to calculate the carbon sequestration rate of each species, which was extrapolated to determine the total quantity of carbon to be sequestrated by the street trees over a 30-year period (2002-2032). It is estimated that the tree planting will result in 200,492 tonnes CO(2) equivalent reduction and that 54,630 tonnes carbon will be sequestrated. The carbon dioxide reductions could be valued at more than US$ 3,000,000. But this estimate should also be viewed in the context of the limitations presented in this study. This illustrates that when future carbon trade becomes operational for urban forests these forests could become a valuable source of revenue for the urban forestry industry, especially in developing countries.

"Agricultural soils contribute towards the emission of methane and nitrous oxide, the two important greenhouse gases causing global warming. Due to the diverse soil, land-use types and climatic conditions, there are uncertainties in quantification of greenhouse gas emission from agricultural soils in India. An inventory of the emission of methane and nitrous oxide from different states in India was prepared using the methodology given by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change. For methane emission, state-specific emission coefficients have been used for all major rice ecosystems. In case of nitrous oxide, both direct and indirect emissions from agricultural soils in different states have been calculated using the emission coefficients derived from the experiments conducted in India. For the base year 1994-95, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from Indian agricultural fields were estimated to be 2.9 Tg (61 Tg CO2 equivalent) and 0.08 Tg (39 Tg CO2 equivalent) respectively.",1
"The development of cleaner and renewable energy sources are needed in order to reduce dependency and global warming. Wood pellets are a clean renewable fuel and has been considered as one of the substitutes for fossil fuels. In Argentina, large quantities of sawmill residues are still unused and wood pellets production could be seen as both, as an environmental solution and an extra economical benefit. The general aim of this study was to determine the wood pellets production costs and energy consumption under different framework conditions in northeast Argentina. The specific costs of wood pellets for the different scenarios showed relative lower costs comparing to the ones reported in other studies, ranging from 35 to 47 (sic)/Mg(pellets). Raw material costs represented the main cost factor in the calculation of the total pellets production costs. A lower specific production cost was observed when 50% of the raw material input was wood shavings. The specific electricity consumption per metric ton of pellet was lower in scenarios with higher production rate. Lower heat energy consumption was observed in scenarios that have a mixed raw material input. The most promising framework condition for Northeast Argentina, in terms of costs effectiveness and energy consumption could be acquired with production rates of 6 Mg/h with sawdust and wood shavings as raw material. However, simultaneous increment of the electricity by 50% and raw material price by 100% may increase the specific costs up to 50%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The threat of global warming calls for a major transformation of the energy system in the coming century. The treatment of technological change in energy system models is a critical challenge. Technological change may be treated as induced by climate policy or as exogenous. We investigate the importance of induced technological change (ITC) in GET-LFL, an iterative optimization model with Limited Foresight that incorporates Learning-by-doing. Scenarios for stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 400, 450, 500 and 550 ppm are studied. We find that the introduction of ITC reduces the total net present value of the abatement cost over this century by 3-9% compared to a case where technological learning is exogenous. Technology specific policies which force the introduction of fuel cell cars and solar PV in combination with ITC reduce the costs further by 4-7% and lead to significantly different technological solutions, primarily in the transport sector.",1
"This paper presents a comprehensive spatial model for exploring the interaction between road transportation and environment. The potential negative impacts of transportation on environment can be listed as degradation of air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, increased threat of global climate change, degradation of water resources, noise and habitat loss and fragmentation. Within this interaction, of particular importance is the relationship between urban structure and transport emissions, since it is the urban structure that fundamentally determines transportation demand. Due to the spatial nature of the interaction, Spatial Information Sciences (SIS) has many advantages compared with other systems. The developed model integrates data and methods on spatial bases, detects changes, encompasses monitoring and analyzes the interaction. In order to verify the developed concepts, a pilot project was conducted at the southeast part of Istanbul Metropolitan Area, where the development of motorway and its effects to land use categories between 1987 and 2001 period was analyzed. Within the study area, the road transportation network had been doubled, whereas the construction sites were tripled within the years of 1987-200 A significant decrease was observed at barren and agricultural land classes. Using the suggested model an integrated framework for exploring the interaction was constituted and the results were discussed.",1
"Temperate species are projected to experience the greatest temperature increases across a range of modelled climate change scenarios, and climate warming has been linked to geographical range and population changes of individual species at such latitudes. However, beyond the multiple modelling approaches, we lack empirical evidence of contemporary climate change impacts on populations in broad taxonomic groups and at continental scales. Identifying reliable predictors of species resilience or susceptibility to climate warming is of critical importance in assessing potential risks to species, ecosystems and ecosystem services. Here we analysed long-term trends of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (20 countries), to identify climate niche characteristics, adjusted to other environmental and life history traits, that predict large-scale population changes accounting for phylogenetic relatedness among species. Beyond the now well-documented decline of farmland specialists, we found that species with the lowest thermal maxima (as the mean spring and summer temperature of the hottest part of the breeding distribution in Europe) showed the sharpest declines between 1980 and 2005. Thermal maximum predicted the recent trends independently of other potential predictors. This study emphasizes the need to account for both land-use and climate changes to assess the fate of species. Moreover, we highlight that thermal maximum appears as a reliable and simple predictor of the long-term trends of such endothermic species facing climate change.",1
"The response of boreal ecosystems to future global change is an uncertain but potentially critical component of the feedback between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. To reduce some of the uncertainties in predicting the responses of this key ecosystem, the climate change experiment (CLIMEX) exposed an entire undisturbed catchment of boreal vegetation to CO2 enrichment (560 ppmv) and climate change (+ 5 degrees C in winter, + 3 degrees C in summer) for three years (1994-96). This paper describes the leaf metabolic responses of the vegetation to the experimental treatment and model simulations of possible future changes in the hydrological and carbon balance of the site. Randomized intervention analysis of the leaf gas exchange measurements for the dominant species indicated Pinus sylvestris had significantly (P < 0.01) higher photosynthetic rates and Betula pubescens and Vaccinium myrtillus had significantly (P < 0.01) lower stomatal conductances after three years treatment compared to the controls. These responses led to sustained increases in leaf water-use efficiency of all species of trees and ground shrubs, as determined from carbon isotope analyses. Photosynthesis (A) vs. intercellular CO2 (c(i)) response curves (A/c(i) responses), RuBisCo analysis and leaf nitrogen data together suggested none of the species investigated exhibited down-regulation in photosynthetic capacity. At the whole ecosystem level, the improved water economy of the plants did not translate into increased catchment runoff. Modelling simulations for the site indicate this was most likely brought about by a compensatory increase in evapotranspiration. In terms of the carbon budget of the site, the ecosystem model indicates that increased CO2 and temperature would lead to boreal ecosystems of the type used in CLIMEX, and typical of much of southern Norway, acting as moderate net sinks for CO2.",1
"Recently the regional impact assessment due to global warming is one of the urgent tasks to every country in the world, under the circumstances of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This assessment must include not only meteorological factors, such as surface air temperature and precipitation, etc., but also the response of the local ecosystem. Based on a previous study, for example, it has been known that Phyllostachys' habitation, which is one of the bamboo species popular in Korea, is quite sensitive to temperature change, in particular during the winter season. Thus, adequate climate information is essential to derive a solid conclusion on the regional impact assessment for future climate change. In this study, we adopted a dynamical downscaling technique to get regional future climate information, with the regional climate model (MM5, Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale model) from the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology Models and Data Group's Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) ECAHM4, and HOPE-G (ECHO-G) simulation for future climate, based on future greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2. Through this nesting process we got reasonable regional climate change information. However, we found a couple of systematic differences, such as a cold bias in the surface air temperature, simulated by MM5 compared to that by the AOGCM ECHO-G. This cold bias may cause to loose credibility on the future climate scenario to the impact assessment studies. Accordingly, we introduced a transfer function to correct the systematic bias of the dynamic model in the regional-scale, and to predict the regional climate from large-scale predictors. These transfer functions are obtained from the daily mean temperature of 17 surface observation stations in Korea for 10 years from 1992 to 2001, and 10-year simulation data obtained from regional climate model (RCM) for each mode of EOFA to correct the systematic bias of RCM data. With these transfer functions, we can correct the RMS error of the daily mean temperature in RCM as much as 47.6% in winter and 86.5% in summer. After dynamical downscaling and statistical adjustment, we may provide adequate climate change information for regional assessment studies.",1
"This study uses a global climate model (GCM) to investigate the climate response at the surface and in the atmosphere caused by land use change. The climate simulations are performed with the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model 3.5 (CLM3.5) coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model 3 (CAM3) and a slab ocean model. We use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface albedo product to represent surface albedo in the CLM3.5 for both present day and to reconstruct the surface albedo for natural pre-agriculture conditions. We compare simulations including vegetation changes and surface albedo changes to simulations including only surface albedo changes. We find that the surface albedo change is most dominant in temperate regions while the change in evapotranspiration drives the climate response in the tropics. Our results show that land cover changes contribute to an annual global warming of 0.04 K, but there are large regional differences. In North America and Europe, the surface temperatures decrease by -0.11 and -0.09 K, respectively, while in India the surface temperatures increase by 0.09 K. When we fix the vegetation cover in the simulations and let the climate changes be driven only by the differences in surface albedo, the annual global mean surface warming is reduced, and all three regions are now associated with surface cooling. We also show that the surface albedo value for cropland is of major importance in climate simulations of land cover change. The surface albedo effect is the main driving mechanism when the change in surface albedo between agricultural and natural vegetation is substantial. Finally, we argue that differences in the surface albedo value of cropland implemented in earlier land use change studies explain the diversity in the sign and magnitude of the climate response.

"This paper presents a novel smart film actuator based on the use of a biomass plastic as a piezoelectric film. Conventional polymeric smart sensors and actuators have been based upon synthetic piezoelectric polymer films such as PVDF. Almost all synthetic polymers are made from nearly depleted oil resources. In addition combustion of their materials releases carbon dioxide, thereby contributing to global warming. Thus at least two important sustainability principles are violated when employing synthetic polymers: avoiding depletable resources and avoiding ecosystem destruction. To overcome such problems, industrial plastic products made from synthetic polymers were developed to replace oil-based plastics with biomass plastics. This paper applies a biomass plastic with piezoelectricity such as poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA). As a result, PLLA film becomes a distributed parameter actuator per se, hence an environmentally conscious smart film actuator is developed. Firstly, this paper overviews the fundamental properties of piezoelectric synthetic polymers and biopolymers. The concept of carbon neutrality using biopolymers is mentioned. Then a two-dimensional modal actuator for exciting a specific structural mode is proposed. Furthermore, a biomass plastic-based cantilever beam with the capability of modal actuation is developed, the validity of the proposed smart film actuator based upon a biomass plastic being analytically as well as experimentally verified.",1
"The relationship between paleoclimates and the future climate, while not as simple as implied in the 'paleoanalog' studies of Budyko and others, nevertheless provides sufficient constraints to broadly confirm the climate sensitivity range of theoretical models and perhaps eventually narrow the model-derived uncertainties. We use a new technique called 'paleocalibration' to calculate the ratio of temperature response to forcing on a global mean scale for three key intervals of Earth history. By examining surface conditions reconstructed from geologic data for the Last Glacial Maximum, the middle Cretaceous and the early Eocene, we can estimate the equilibrium climate sensitivity to radiative forcing changes for different extreme climates. We find that the ratios for these three periods, within error bounds, all lie in the range obtained from general circulation models: 2-5 K global warming for doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide. Paleocalibration thus provides a data-based confirmation of theoretically calculated climate sensitivity. However, when compared with paleodata on regional scales, the models show less agreeement with data. For example, our GCM simulation of the early Eocene fails to obtain the temperature contrasts between the Equator and the Poles (and between land and ocean areas) indicated by the data, even though it agrees with the temperature data in the global average. Similar results have been reported by others for the Cretaceous and for the Last Glacial Maximum.",1
"Peatlands occupy approximately 15% of boreal and sub-arctic regions, contain approximately one third of the world's soil carbon pool, and supply most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) entering boreal lakes and rivers and the Arctic Ocean. The high latitudes occupied by these peatlands are expected to see the greatest amount of climatic warming in the next several decades. In addition to increasing temperatures, climatic change could also affect the position of the water-table level and discharge from these peatlands. Changes in temperature, water tables, and discharge could affect delivery of DOC to downstream ecosystems where it exerts significant control over productivity, biogeochemical cycles, and attenuation of visible and UV radiation. We experimentally warmed and controlled water tables while measuring discharge in a factorial experiment in large mesocosms containing peat monoliths and intact plant communities from a bog and fen to determine the effects of climate change on DOC budgets. We show that the DOC budget is controlled largely by changes in discharge rather than by any effect of warming or position of the water-table level on DOC concentrations. Furthermore, we identify a critical discharge rate in bogs and fens for which the DOC budget switches from net export to net retention. We also demonstrate an exponential increase in trace gas CO2-C and CH4-C emissions coincident with increased retention of dissolved organic carbon from boreal peatlands.",1
"Climate change is likely to have major implications for wetland ecosystems, which will include altered water level regimes due to modifications in local and catchment hydrology. However, substantial uncertainty exists in the precise impacts of climate change on wetlands due in part to uncertainty in GCM projections. This paper explores the impacts of climate change upon river discharge within three sub-catchments of Loktak Lake, an internationally important wetland in northeast India. This is achieved by running pattern-scaled GCM output through distributed hydrological models (developed using MIKE SHE) of each sub-catchment. The impacts of climate change upon water levels within Loktak Lake are subsequently investigated using a water balance model. Two groups of climate change scenarios are investigated. Group 1 uses results from seven different GCMs for an increase in global mean temperature of 2 A degrees C, the purported threshold of ''dangerous'' climate change, whilst Group 2 is based on results from the HadCM3 GCM for increases in global mean temperature between 1 A degrees C and 6 A degrees C. Results from the Group 1 scenarios show varying responses between the three sub-catchments. The majority of scenario-sub-catchment combinations (13 out of 21) indicate increases in discharge which vary from < 1% to 42% although, in some cases, discharge decreases by as much as 20%. Six of the GCMs suggest overall increases in river flow to Loktak Lake (2-27%) whilst the other results in a modest (6%) decline. In contrast, the Group 2 scenarios lead to an almost linear increase in total river flow to Loktak Lake with increasing temperature (up to 27% for 6 A degrees C), although two sub-catchments experience reductions in mean discharge for the smallest temperature increases. In all but one Group 1 scenario, and all the Group 2 scenarios, Loktak Lake water levels are higher, regularly reaching the top of a downstream hydropower barrage that impounds the lake and necessitating the release of water for barrage structural stability. Although elevated water levels may permit enhanced abstraction for irrigation and domestic uses, future increases in hydropower generation are limited by existing infrastructure. The higher water levels are likely to exacerbate existing ecological deterioration within the lake as well as enhancing problems of flooding of lakeside communities.",1
"Interest in attributing the risk of damaging weather-related events to anthropogenic climate change is increasing(1). Yet climate models used to study the attribution problem typically do not resolve the weather systems associated with damaging events(2) such as the UK floods of October and November 2000. Occurring during the wettest autumn in England and Wales since records began in 1766(3,4), these floods damaged nearly 10,000 properties across that region, disrupted services severely, and caused insured losses estimated at 3 pound billion (refs 5, 6). Although the flooding was deemed a 'wakeup call' to the impacts of climate change at the time(7), such claims are typically supported only by general thermodynamic arguments that suggest increased extreme precipitation under global warming, but fail(8,9) to account fully for the complex hydrometeorology(4,10) associated with flooding. Here we present a multi-step, physically based 'probabilistic event attribution' framework showing that it is very likely that global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions substantially increased the risk of flood occurrence in England and Wales in autumn 2000. Using publicly volunteered distributed computing(11,12), we generate several thousand seasonal-forecast-resolution climate model simulations of autumn 2000 weather, both under realistic conditions, and under conditions as they might have been had these greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting large-scale warming never occurred. Results are fed into a precipitation-runoff model that is used to simulate severe daily river runoff events in England and Wales (proxy indicators of flood events). The precise magnitude of the anthropogenic contribution remains uncertain, but in nine out of ten cases our model results indicate that twentieth-century anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions increased the risk of floods occurring in England and Wales in autumn 2000 by more than 20%, and in two out of three cases by more than 90%.",1
"Two types of carbonisation plant and one gasification plant have been developed and tested for effective utilisation of the products. The importance of by-products is increasing, as global warming is now a significant problem, and biomass resources can be used to alleviate the energy shortage and minimise the emission of greenhouse gases. Carbonisation of bagasse can add new value for production of energy and other materials, so continuous type carbonisers were developed. The bagasse becomes charcoal by heating in the absence of oxygen for about 30 minutes at 400 to 900 degrees C. Bagasse charcoal was used as a soil improvement material, absorbent, deodorant and so on. A large volume of burnable gas was obtained from bagasse or its charcoal by the developed gasifier. The plant turns to a carboniser by exclusion of air. Therefore, bagasse can be used as a value-added resource for energy and other materials by carbonisation and gasification.",1
"This paper is concerned with nonmarket valuation in the context of global warming. First, concerning the impact of global warming: what are the prospects for the inclusion of nonmarket values in estimates of the damages of warming? The second question relates to the role of the Principles and Guidelines as the supporting document for water resource projects. Are tools for nonmarket valuation, as found in the Principles and Guidelines satisfactory for water resource project evaluation with a changing climate? The potential effects of climate change are so numerous and subtle that it would be prohibitively costly to measure them all. Thus a comprehensive program for including nonmarket damages as part of the costs of global warming seems ill-advised. Where specific concerns arise, researchers may learn from small scale studies. Many of the damages of global warming are diminished by the ability of humans to adapt at small costs, especially the nonuse component of nonmarket values. When the question concerns minor water resource projects, the gains from including extra effects induced by global warming seem to be small compared with the costs. The Principles and Guidelines does not reflect current practices in benefit estimation. However, it is not clear that this is a serious problem, because most practitioners continue to revise their understanding of valuation methods. If the Principles and Guidelines were to be revised, it would make sense to provide more current guidelines for all of the behavioral models and contingent valuation. Revisions of the Principles and Guidelines should not do anything special for anthropocentrically induced climate change.",1
"To obtain an estimate of the average temperature of the northern hemisphere during the last 1200 years, proxy data have been merged with instrumental recordings. These instrumental measurements are, with a few exceptions, only available for the recent 150 years. In the city of Berlin the temperature has been recorded since as early as 170 However, during the first 150 years the measurements were problematic as location, measurement procedure and instruments changed frequently and without proper documentation. From 1847 onwards observations became more reliable once the Royal Prussian Meteorological Institute had been established. For the last 100 years temperature and precipitation measurements have been performed in parallel at Berlin-Dahlem and Potsdam. The datasets recorded in the city of Berlin and in Berlin-Dahlem have been merged to obtain a record of more than 300 years. It indicates that the temperature of Berlin has risen by 04 degrees C during the last 100 years after correcting for the urbanisation effect. In the same period, the total number of frost days has significantly decreased by almost 17 days, and the number of summer days has significantly increased by about 12 days. Annual mean precipitation has hardly changed (decrease less than 0.2 %) during the last century. However, rainfall has decreased by about 4 % in summer and increased by 3 % in winter. All precipitation changes are below the 95 % significance level. Model projections indicate that warming will continue which means that Berlin-Brandenburg will experience a temperature rise of about 3-3.5 degrees C by the end of this century for the IPCC scenario A1B. For the same scenario precipitation is expected to increase by 10-20 % in winter and to decrease by 10-30 % in summer: The seasonal precipitation changes compensate each other resulting in an almost unchanged annual mean.",1
"Theoretical potential geoengineering solutions to the global warming problem have recently been proposed. Here, we present an idealized study of the climate response to deliberately seeding large-scale stratocumulus cloud decks in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and South Atlantic, thereby inducing cooling via aerosol indirect effects. Atmosphere-only, atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean, and fully coupled atmosphere/ocean versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model are used to investigate the radiative forcing, climate efficacy, and regional response of temperature, precipitation, and net primary productivity to such geoengineering. The radiative forcing simulations indicate that, for our parameterization of aerosol indirect effects, up to 35% of the radiative forcing due to current levels of greenhouse gases could be offset by stratocumulus modification. Equilibrium simulations with the atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean model, wherein each of the three stratocumulus sheets is modified in turn, reveal that the most efficient cooling per unit radiative forcing occurs when the South Pacific stratocumulus sheet is modified. Transient coupled model simulations suggest that geoengineering all three stratocumulus areas delays the simulated global warming by about 25 years. These simulations also indicate that, while some areas experience increases in precipitation and net primary productivity, sharp decreases are simulated in South America, with particularly detrimental impacts on the Amazon rain forest. These results show that, while some areas benefit from geoengineering, there are significant areas where the response could be very detrimental with implications for the practical applicability of such a scheme.",1
"China is now the world's largest producer and user of industrial fertilizers and manures. Consequently China plays a substantial role in global N cycle dynamics and in man's disruption of the nitrogen cycle though there are still significant uncertainties about the size and importance of emission and leaching rates. A major cause of China's global role is the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers, which is most serious with intensive vegetable production where application rates can be up to 50% greater than crop needs, but is also a problem with wheat, rice and maize. China's overuse of nitrogen fertiliser over the past 10-20 years has resulted in non-point source (NPS) pollution from crop production becoming a major cause of water pollution, and the situation is projected to get worse. In contrast, water pollution from point sources such as intensive livestock production and urban or industrial development is being brought more under control. The consequences for air pollution are equally serious. Emissions of nitrous oxide from fertilizers and manures may be so large that China could be responsible for 25-30% of global emissions of this damaging greenhouse gas and of the global warming resulting from it. The main national and local issues relate particularly to low fertilizer use efficiency and the losses of ammonia and NOx that lead to acid precipitation, and leaching and run-off losses that result in high nitrate levels in groundwater and eutrophication of rivers and lakes. The reasons why farmers overuse nitrogen fertilizer are complex and not fully understood. They involve agro-climate differences between provinces and counties, farming systems and farm income structures. Although there is a wide range of institutional and technological improvements that can greatly reduce this overuse rapid progress in reducing NPS is unlikely.",1
"The rejection of hydrogen as a solution to global warming by becoming the medium of wind and solar was made when gasoline was priced at $1/gallon. From wind, H-2 would now cost (by electrolysis of water and steam) less than $3 for an amount equivalent in energy to that in a gallon of gasoline (""equivalent""). From solar photovoltaics (pv), H-2 would be sinking in price between $8 toward $5 equivalent as the efficiency of solar pv increases toward 20%.(1) Solar thermal's present prices offer about one-half the solar pv prices.

"Spacecraft measurements of the sun's total irradiance since 1980 have revealed a long-term variation that is roughly in phase with the 11-year solar cycle. Its origin is uncertain, but may be related to the overall level of solar magnetic activity as well as to the concurrent activity on the visible disk. A low-pass Gaussian filtered time series of the annual sunspot number has been developed as a suitable proxy for solar magnetic activity that contains a long-term component related to the average level of activity as well as a short-term component related to the current phase of the I I-year cycle. This time series is also assumed to be a proxy for solar total irradiance, and the irradiance is reconstructed for the period since 1617 based on the estimate from climatic evidence that global temperatures during the Maunder Minimum of solar activity, which coincided with one of the coldest periods of the Little Ice Age, were about 1 degrees C colder than modem temperatures. This irradiance variation is used as the variable radiative forcing function in a one-dimensional ocean-climate model, leading to a reconstruction of global temperatures over the same period, and to a suggestion that solar forcing and anthropogenic greenhouse-gas forcing made roughly equal contributions to the rise in global temperature that took place between 1900 and 1955. The importance of solar variability as a factor in climate change over the last few decades may have been underestimated in recent studies.",1
"Climate change mitigation requires a rapid decrease of global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from their present value of 8.4 GtC/year to, as of current knowledge, approximately 1 GtC/year by the end of the century. The necessary decrease of GHG emissions will have large impacts on existing and new investments with long lifetimes, such as coal-fired power plants or buildings. Strategic decision making for major investments can be facilitated by indicators that express the likelihood of costly retrofitting or shut-down of carbon intensive equipment over time. We provide a set of simple indicators that Support assessment and decision making in this field. Given a certain emissions target, carbon allowance prices in a cap-and-trade plan will depend on the development of the global economy and the degree to which the target is approached on the global and national levels. The indicators measure the degree to which a given emissions target is approached nationally and assess risks for long-lived investments subject to a range of emissions targets. A comparative case study on existing coal-fired power plants with planned plants and Utility-scale photovoltaic power-plants confirms that high risk for coal-fired power plants is emerging. New legislation further confirms this result.",1
"There is strong scientific evidence that the average temperature of the earth's surface is rising as a result of the increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere owing to human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas. This global warming will lead to substantial changes of climate, many of which will impact human communities in deleterious ways. In terms of the likely global pattern of climate change over the twenty-first century, in the absence of any mitigating action the global average temperature is likely to rise by between about 1-5 and 5-5degreesC and sea level by about half a metre (range 0(.)1-0(.)9 m). The hydrological cycle is likely to be more intense (leading in some places to more frequent and more intense floods and droughts) and the rate of climate change is likely to be substantially greater than the earth has experienced over at least the last ten thousand years. It is particularly to this rapid rate of change that it will be difficult for many ecosystems and for humans to adapt. Action has been taken by the world's scientists through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to assess as thoroughly as possible knowledge regarding the basic science and the impacts, including an assessment of the uncertainties. The world's governments have also taken action in setting up the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) at the Earth Summit in 1992 and at subsequent meetings of the parties to that convention, especially that at Kyoto in 1997. In order to mitigate climate change the FCCC in its article 2 has set the objective of stabilisation of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level and on a timescale consistent with the needs both of the environment and of sustainable development. Such stabilisation will eventually demand severe cuts in global emissions, for instance of carbon dioxide, to levels well below today's by the second half of the twenty-first century. To achieve the required reductions in the emissions of carbon dioxide, three possibilities are available, to sequester carbon dioxide resulting from the burning of fossil fuels rather than releasing it to the atmosphere, to become much more efficient in the generation and use of energy, and to provide for energy supply from non-fossiI fuel sources. This article will summarise the science of climate change including the evidence for it and will describe the main impacts, the actions taken so far, and the further actions that are likely to be necessary to mitigate climate change.",1
"The JAP/LASG GOALS coupled model is used to simulate the climate change during the 20th century using historical greenhouse gases concentrations, the mass mixing ratio of sulfate aerosols simulated by a CTM model, and reconstruction of solar variability spanning the period 1900 to 1997. Four simulations, including a control simulation and three forcing simulations, are conducted. Comparison with the observational record for the period indicates that the three forcing experiments simulate reasonable temporal and spatial distributions of the temperature change. The global warming during the 20th century is caused mainly by increasing greenhouse gas concentration especially since the late 1980s; sulfate aerosols offset a portion of the global warming and the reduction of global temperature is up to about 0.11degreesC over the century; additionally, the effect of solar variability is not negligible in the simulation of climate change over the 20th century.",1
"Octopuses of the family Octopodidae adopt two major life-history strategies. The first is the production of relatively few, large eggs resulting in well-developed hatchlings that resemble the adults and rapidly adopt the benthic habit of their parents. The second strategy is production of numerous small eggs that hatch into planktonic, free-swimming hatchlings with few suckers, simple chromatophores and transparent musculature. These distinctive planktonic stages are termed paralarvae and differ from conspecific adults in their morphology, physiology, ecology and behaviour. This study aims to review available knowledge on this subject. In benthic octopuses with planktonic stages, spawning characteristics and duration of planktonic life seem to play an important role in their dispersal capacities. Duration of the hatching period of a single egg mass can range from 2 days to 11 wk, while duration of the planktonic stage can range from 3 wk to half a year, depending on the species and temperature. Thus these paralarvae possess considerable potential for dispersal. In some species, individuals reach relatively large sizes while living as part of the micronekton of oceanic, epipelagic waters. Such forms appear to delay settlement for an unknown period that is suspected to be longer than for paralarvae in more coastal, neritic waters. During the planktonic period, paralarval octopuses feed on crustaceans as their primary prey. In addition to the protein, critical to the protein-based metabolism of octopuses (and all cephalopods), the lipid and copper contents of the prey also appear important in maintaining normal growth. Littoral and oceanic fishes are their main predators and defence behaviours may involve fast swimming speeds, use of ink decoys, dive responses and camouflage. Sensory systems of planktonic stages include photo-, mechano- and chemoreceptors controlled by a highly evolved nervous system that follows the general pattern described for adult cephalopods. On settlement, a major metamorphosis occurs in morphology, physiology and behaviour. Morphological changes associated with the settlement process include positive allometric arm growth; chromatophore, iridophore and leucophore genesis; development of skin sculptural components and a horizontal pupillary response. At the same time, animals lose the Kolliker organs that cover the body surface, the 'lateral line system' and the oral denticles of the beaks. Strong positive phototaxis is a common response for hatchlings and some later paralarval stages but this response reduces, disappears or reverses after settlement. There are many gaps in our knowledge of the planktonic phases of benthic octopuses. Most of our understanding of octopus paralarvae comes from studies of just two species (Octopus vulgaris and Enteroctopus dofleini) and knowledge of the vast majority of benthic octopus species with planktonic stages is considered rudimentary or non-existent. Research is needed in a variety of fields, from taxonomy to ecology. Studies of feeding and nutrition are critical in order to develop the nascent aquaculture of key species and ageing studies are necessary to understand planktonic population dynamics, particularly in commercially valuable species targeted by fisheries. Current and potential anthropogenic impacts on these early life stages of octopuses, such as pollution, overfishing and global warming, are also identified.",1
"Ensemble experiments with a global coupled climate model are performed for the twentieth century with time-evolving solar, greenhouse gas, sulfate aerosol (direct effect), and ozone (tropospheric and stratospheric) forcing. Observed global warming in the twentieth century occurred in two periods, one in the early twentieth century from about the early 1900s to the 1940s, and one later in the century from, roughly, the late 1960s to the end of the century. The model's response requires the combination of solar and anthropogenic forcing to approximate the early twentieth-century warming, while the radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gases is dominant for the response in the late twentieth century, confirming previous studies. Of particular interest here is the model's amplification of solar forcing when this acts in combination with anthropogenic forcing. This difference is traced to the fact that solar forcing is more spatially heterogeneous (i.e., acting most strongly in areas where sunlight reaches the surface) while greenhouse gas forcing is more spatially uniform. Consequently, solar forcing is subject to coupled regional feedbacks involving the combination of temperature gradients, circulation regimes, and clouds. The magnitude of these feedbacks depends on the climate's base state. Over relatively cloud-free oceanic regions in the subtropics, the enhanced solar forcing produces greater evaporation. More moisture then converges into the precipitation convergence zones, intensifying the regional monsoon and Hadley and Walker circulations, causing cloud reductions over the subtropical ocean regions, and, hence, more solar input. An additional response to solar forcing in northern summer is an enhancement of the meridional temperature gradients due to greater solar forcing over land regions that contribute to stronger West African and South Asian monsoons. Since the greenhouse gases are more spatially uniform, such regional circulation feedbacks are not as strong. These regional responses are most evident when the solar forcing occurs in concert with increased greenhouse gas forcing. The net effect of enhanced solar forcing in the early twentieth century is to produce larger solar-induced increases of tropical precipitation when calculated as a residual than for early century solar-only forcing, even though the size of the imposed solar forcing is the same. As a consequence, overall precipitation increases in the early twentieth century in the Asian monsoon regions are greater than late century increases, qualitatively consistent with observed trends in all-India rainfall. Similar effects occur in West Africa, the tropical Pacific, and the Southern Ocean tropical convergence zones.",1
"In this study we consider the implications of our current understanding of aviation climate impacts as it relates to the ratio of non-CO2 to CO2 effects from aviation. We take as inputs recent estimates from the literature of the magnitude of the component aviation impacts and associated uncertainties. We then employ a simplified probabilistic impulse response function model for the climate and a range of damage functions to estimate the ratio of non-CO2 to CO2 impacts of aviation for a range of different metrics, scientific assumptions, future background emissions scenarios, economic growth scenarios, and discount rates. We take cost-benefit analysis as our primary context and thus focus on integral metrics that can be related to damages: the global warming potential, the time-integrated change in surface temperature, and the net present value of damages. We also present results based on an endpoint metric, the global temperature change potential. These latter results would be more appropriate for use in a cost-effectiveness framework (e.g., with a well-defined policy target for the anthropogenic change in surface temperature at a specified time in the future). We find that the parameter that most influences the ratio of non-CO2 to CO2 impacts of aviation is the discount rate, or analogously the time window used for physical metrics; both are expressions of the relative importance of long-lived versus short-lived impacts. Second to this is the influence of the radiative forcing values that are assumed for aviation-induced cloudiness effects. Given the large uncertainties in short-lived effects from aviation, and the dominating influence of discounting or time-windowing, we find that the choice of metric is relatively less influential. We express the ratios of non-CO2 to CO2 impacts on a per unit fuel burn basis so that they can be multiplied by a social cost of carbon to estimate the additional benefits of fuel burn reductions from aviation beyond those associated with CO2 alone (all else being equal). For a non-CO2 to CO2 ratio based on economic damage costs, we find a central value of 8 at a 3% discount rate, with a range from 0.6 to 2.5 for the upper and lower bounds of scientific and scenario-based uncertainty. Since estimating the co-benefits in this way is an important requirement for cost-benefit analyses, we also provide estimates of the air quality benefits of aviation fuel burn reduction in a similar format. We find the marginal damage costs of aircraft emissions below 3000 feet to be of similar magnitude to the climate costs on a per unit fuel burn basis, or an order of magnitude smaller on a per flight basis since we take no account of the air quality impacts of emissions above 3000 feet where the majority of fuel is consumed for the fleet.

"Lowland rice production is currently facing serious water shortages in numerous Asian countries. In the North China Plain water limitations are severe. Water-saving rice production techniques are therefore increasingly searched for. Here we present the first study of trace gas emissions from a water-saving rice production system where soils are mulched and are kept close to field capacity in order to compare their contribution to global warming with traditional paddy rice. In a two-year field experiment close to Beijing, CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes were monitored in two forms of the Ground Cover Rice Production System (GCRPS) and in traditional paddy fields using closed chambers. With paddy rice the observed CH(4) emissions were very low, about 0.3 g CH(4) m(-2) a(-1) in 2001 and about 1 g CH(4) m(-2) a(-1) in 2002. In GCRPS, the CH(4) emissions were negligible. N(2)O fluxes in GCRPS were similar, 0.5 to 0.6 g N(2)O m(-2) a(-1) in 2001 and 2002, and emission peaks mainly followed fertilizer applications. In paddy rice, N(2)O fluxes were unexpectedly low throughout the year 2001 (0.03 g N(2)O m(-2) a(-1)), and in 2002 larger emissions occurred during the drainage period. So with 0.4 g N(2)O m(-2) a(-1) the cumulative flux was similar to emissions in GCRPS. Total CO(2) equivalent fluxes calculated according to IPCC methodology were tenfold higher in GCRPS compared to paddy in 200 In 2002, fluxes from both systems were similar with 175 and 141 g CO(2) equivalents m(-2) a(-1) from GCRPS and paddy.",1
"Paleoclimate modeling has become an important tool to detect the future climate of the global warming that is difficult to be validated. The paleoclimate modeling has to be evaluated by regionally geological data in order to determine if it is able to reproduce a reality of climate states. Geological evidence shows that there was a warm-wet interstadial at 35000 +/- 3000 a BP in China, which provides an important climate period to be historical analogue for the future climate changes induced by greenhouse gas emissions. Integrated geological records of later phase of the MSI3 from China also provide basements for evaluation of 35 ka BP climate modeling. This paper reports the paleoclimate experiments applied by various forces, and validates the outputs by geological data, consequently improving the boundary conditions in the experiments and making the paleoclimates more approach the reality. The simulations show an increased temperature in the mid-low latitudes and an extended rain-belt northwards in East Asia, while a decreased temperature in high latitudes and a strong exchange of the N-S atmospheric circulation. As there is only ca. 10-15 ka from 35 ka BP to the LGM (21 ka BP) during which climate rapidly changed from a warm-wet interstadial to a typical ice age, this simulation provides scientific basis to recognize the criteria of global warming and trends of natural climate development.",1
"This study was conducted to evaluate the causality between energy consumption, GDP growth and carbon emissions for eight Asia-Pacific countries from 1971 to 2005 using the panel data. The results indicate that there are long-run equilibrium relationships between these variables. Additionally, causality from energy consumption to CO2 emissions was observed generally, but there were some opposite relationships also. Parameter estimations of the panel data model indicate that there are great differences in the carbon emissions, the efficiencies of energy use, carbon emissions of unit GDP and unit energy consumption between developed and developing countries. The base carbon emissions, per capita energy consumption and efficiency of energy use in developing countries are far lower than in developed countries; however, the CO2 emissions per unit of energy use is higher. Although developing countries may reduce their CO2 emission per unit energy use, total energy consumption will rise rapidly with economic development. Thus, developing countries must determine how to undergo economic growth while conserving energy and reducing emissions. To respond to global climate change, it is necessary to develop innovative technology for energy use, transform the energy structure and conduct the clean development mechanism.

"Density functional theory studies were performed for the first time to obtain the Li+ ion affinities of various perfluorocarbons (PFCs) that cause global-warming. Becke's three-parameter hybrid density functional, B3LYP combined with 6-31G(d), 6-311+G(2d), and 6-311+G(3df) basis sets were utilized for this purpose. We present optimized geometries of PFC-Li+ ion complexes at B3LYP/6-311+G(2d) level. The frequencies obtained at the same level were used to verify all the optimized geometries are minima. The following PFCs-CF4, CHF3, CH2F2, CH3F, C2F6, C4F8, with SF6-were considered in the present study. The calculated Lif affinities for CF4, CHF3, CH2F2, CH3F, C2F6, C4F8, and SF6 are 12.31, 19.64, 26.84, 30.10, 17.20, 209, and 16.92 kcal/mol, respectively at B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) after zero-point energy and thermal energy corrections. The large Li+ affinities indicate the validity of our proposed Li+ ion attachment mass spectrometry to quantify the emission of these greenhouse gases from semiconductor industries. Complex geometries were obtained and the ion-molecular bonding nature was discussed on the basis of atomic charge, electron density rho, and its Laplacian.",1
"Under phytotronic conditions investigations were made on the effect of important environmental factors, such as temperature, water and an increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2, on the hardening of young cereal plants. In all the varieties derived from the major wheat growing regions of the world the hardening process was favourably influenced by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content, so that a significantly larger number of plants survived the frost test than for plants of the same variety raised under normal conditions. A reduction in freezing temperature and an increase in soil moisture content caused a slight reduction in survival % for varieties with excellent frost resistance and a great reduction for those with medium or poor frost resistance. Predictions suggest that in Central Europe, as the result of global climatic changes, there will be a reduction in the quantity of winter precipitation, a considerable rise in winter temperatures and an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Judging by the experimental results, these changes could improve the overwintering of winter cereals; at the same time, however, a number of factors (mainly the reduction of precipitation) leading to yield losses must be expected during the vegetation period.",1
"This work provides information concerning possible global environmental implications and personnel safety aspects that should be considered during the commercial uses of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). SF6 is an anthropogenically produced compound, mainly used as a gaseous dielectric in gas insulated switchgear power installations. It is a potent greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential, and its concentration in the earth atmosphere is rapidly increasing. During its working cycle, SF6 decomposes under electrical stress, forming toxic byproducts that are a health threat for working personnel in the event of exposure. Several precautions are recommended to avoid personnel exposure to toxic byproducts: oxyfluoride levels or other byproduct concentrations in the operating gas matrix should be traced to predetermine the overall gas toxicity; contaminants should be systematically considered during maintenance, chamber evacuation and system opening process; small SF6 quantities leaking into air or stagnated pollutant concentrations in the operating field should be analyzed and compared to the threshold limit values and permissible exposure levels. New system design rules (i.e., hermetically sealed gas compartments, gas recycling or disposal in the field area) and different handling policies-both during maintenance and final disposal-now should be considered globally to provide for environmental and personnel safety.",1
"Considering the disadvantage of the present home and aboard biomass gasifiers, a new design was conducted to improve the current conditions such as low combustion, high tar and dust, low heat value and so on. A suite of gasification was achieved to decrease tar, sulfur and dust during gasification process. The developing system provides a feasible strategy for improving and developing gasifier equipment. The improved gasifier equipment includes gas generator, high temperature pyrolysis apparatus, the first dust filter, the second dust filter, heat-cold exchange apparatus, washing apparatus, motive power apparatus, tar removal apparatus, and sulfur removal apparatus. The harmless combustible gases enter the gas container, and go through a dedicated pipeline, and then the gas was delivered to the house for coking, heating or generating electricity. Up to now, the improved gasifier equipment has been successfully applied to some communities in Qinghai and inner Mongolia of China. Implications of the improved gasifier equipment is improving human health, reducing fuel consumption, deforestation and global climate change. It was found cost-effective and renewable in nature and suitable for both urban and rural areas, especially in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau because of the anoxia. The study has applied the patent of the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China (Patent number: 201020192115.2).

"Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) involves weighing tradeoffs between multiple and incommensurate criteria. Current state-of-the-art LCIA tools typically compute an overall environmental score using a linear-weighted aggregation of characterized inventory data that has been normalized relative to total industry, regional, or national emissions. However, current normalization practices risk masking impacts that may be significant within the context of the decision, albeit small relative to the reference data (e.g.,total U.S. emissions). Additionally, uncertainty associated with quantification of weights is generally very high. Partly for these reasons, many LCA studies truncate impact assessment at the inventory characterization step, rather than completing normalization and weighting steps. This paper describes a novel approach called stochastic multiattribute life cycle impact assessment (SMA-LCIA) that combines an outranking approach to normalization with stochastic exploration of weight spaces-avoiding some of the drawbacks of current LCIA methods. To illustrate the new approach, SMA-LCIA is compared with a typical LCIA method for crop-based, fossil-based, and electric fuels using the Greenhouse gas Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model for inventory data and the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) model for data characterization. In contrast to the typical LCIA case, in which results are dominated by fossil fuel depletion and global warming considerations regardless of criteria weights, the SMA-LCIA approach results in a rank ordering that is more sensitive to decision-maker preferences. The principal advantage of the SMA-LCIA method is the ability to facilitate exploration and construction of context-specific criteria preferences by simultaneously representing multiple weights spaces and the sensitivity of the rank ordering to uncertain stakeholder values.",1
"Methane is an active Greenhouse effect gas whose concentration will likely increase in the future. The possible destabilisation of CH4 clathrates (hydrates) due to anthropogenic climate warming, and the resulting outgasing of methane, could lead to a major increase of the global Greenhouse effect, with dramatic consequences for Humanity. For these reasons, the study of possible countermeasures should be actively considered. Here, we suggest taking advantage of the thermodynamic instability of CH4 in air, and search for ways to oxidize it. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.",1
"After 500 years of exploitation and sestruction the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been reduced to less the 8% of its original cover, and climate change may pose a new threat ot the remnants of this biodiversity hotspot In this study we used modelling techniques to determine present and future geographical distribution of 38 species of trees that are typical of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica) considering two global warming scenarios The optimistic scenario, based in a 0 5% increase in the concentration of CO(2) in the atmaosphere, predicts an increase of up to 2 degrees C in the Earth s average temperature in the pessimistic scenario based on a 1% increase in the concentration of CO(2) in the atmosphere temperature increase may reach 4 degrees C Using these parameters the occurence points of the studied species registered in literature, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule set Predictions/GARP and Maximum entropy modeling of species geographic distributions/MaxEnt we developed models of present and future possible occurence of each species considering Earth's mean temeprature by 2050 with the optimistic and the pessimistic scenarios of CO(2) emission The results obtained show an alarming reduction in the area of possible occurence of the species studied as well as a shift towards southern areas of Brazil Using GARP on average in the optimistic scenario this reduction is of 25% while in the pessimsistic scenario it reaches 50% and the species that will suffer the worst reduction in their possible aarea of occurrence are Euterpe edulis Mollinedia schottiana Virola bicuhyba Inga sessilis and Vochyasta magnifica Using MaxEnt, on average in the optimistic scenario the reducation will be of 20% while in the pessimsistic secenario it reaches 30%, and the species that will suffer the worst reduciton are Hyeronima alchorneoides Schefflera angustissima Andira fraxinifolia and the species of Myrtaceae studied",1
"An overview is provided of the observed and potential future responses of zooplankton communities to global warming. I begin by describing the importance of zooplankton in ocean ecosystems and the attributes that make them sensitive beacons of climate change. Global warming may have even greater repercussions for marine ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems, because temperature influences water column stability, nutrient enrichment, and the degree of new production, and thus the abundance, size composition, diversity, and trophic efficiency of zooplankton. Pertinent descriptions of physical changes in the ocean in response to climate change are given as a prelude to a detailed discussion of observed impacts of global warming on zooplankton. These manifest as changes in the distribution of individual species and assemblages, in the timing of important life-cycle events, and in abundance and community structure. The most illustrative case studies, where climate has had an obvious, tangible impact on zooplankton and substantial ecosystem consequences, are presented. Changes in the distribution and phenology of zooplankton are faster and greater than those observed for terrestrial groups. Relevant projected changes in ocean conditions are then presented, followed by an exploration of potential future changes in zooplankton communities from the perspective of different modelling approaches. Researchers have used a range of modelling approaches on individual species and functional groups forced by output from climate models under future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. I conclude by suggesting some potential future directions in climate change research for zooplankton, viz. the use of richer zooplankton functional groups in ecosystem models; greater research effort in tropical systems; investigating climate change in conjunction with other human impacts; and a global zooplankton observing system.",1
"A novel continuous fixed bed reactor process has been developed for the production of biodiesel using a metal oxide-based catalyst. Porous zirconia, titania and alumina micro-particulate heterogeneous catalysts are shown to be capable of continuous rapid esterification and transesterfication reactions under high pressure (ca. 2500 psi) and elevated temperature (300-450 degrees C). The continuous transesterification of triglycerides and simultaneous esterification of free fatty acids with residence times as low as 5.4 s is described. Biodiesel produced from soybean oil, acidulated soapstock, tall oil, algae oil, and corn oil with different alcohols to make different alkyl esters using this new process pass all current ASTM testing specifications. Furthermore, the economics of this novel process is much more cost competitive due to the use of inexpensive lipid feedstocks that often contain high levels of free fatty acids. The process has been shown to easily scale up a factor of 49 for more than 115 h of continuous operation without loss of conversion efficiency. The increased use of biodiesel world-wide could help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases that are linked to the progression of global warming. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"In 2008, 95% of the vehicle fleet in the developed countries and 80% of fleet in the developing countries were equipped with mobile air conditioning systems (MACs). Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted due to refrigerant leakage (direct emissions) and due to the energy consumed by MACs operation (indirect emissions). In response to reducing the global warming impact of MACs, policy makers and the industry are investigating alternative refrigerant systems that use low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants. The GREEN-MAC-LCCP model assesses the direct and indirect CO2 equivalent emissions related to MACs usage, as well as those associated with the production, use and disposal of alternative refrigerants and MACs components. This model provides a platform for simple data input and provides an output summary as well as details that can be analyzed in a custom fashion by the user. It provides engineers and policy makers a state-of-the-art tool, based on sound engineering data and methods, in order to facilitate the process of evaluating alternate refrigerants with low lifecycle global warming impact as well as providing the total impact of any MACs on the environment It has been recognized as the standard of the MACs industry.",1
"Public sewage treatment plants in Japan consume 6.3 billion kWh of electricity and produce 350 million tons of sludge annually, with serious impacts on the local and global environment. In this study, a Life Cycle Inventory of a sewage treatment plant for domestic wastewater was done to assess the environmental effects using data from statistics and previous studies. The system boundaries include sewage pipe construction and operation, sewage treatment plant construction and operation, material production and sludge treatment. The functional unit is defined as the treatment system of wastewater produced by one person in one year. Energy consumption and global warming are studied as the environmental parameters. The following conclusions have been drawn from the results. 1) Energy consumption and emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) increase exponentially as the population density decreases. 2) If the actual population is less than the planned population, the operation efficiency of the sewage treatment plant decreases. 3) The energy consumption per person per year is 1,026 MJ, and CO2 equivalent emission factor is 89 kg. 4) Energy consumption for sewage treatment plant operation accounts for 78% of the total energy consumption. Under the assumption that 20% of the total carbon in the sludge is converted to CH4, the CH4 emitted from sludge landfill and the N2O generated by sludge incineration contribute respectively 35% and 14% to global warming. These results also show that further development of sludge recycling technology is desirable to decrease GHGs.",1
"The aim of this study is that, giving theoretical information about climate change, making some explanation about global trend of wind energy market and developments of Turkish wind energy market finally giving some information about wind energy regulations in Germany. Energy is one of the main sources of economical and social developments. Energy demand Is increasing day by day both global and national scale of many countries. Current energy paradigm is based on foss, I fuels but fossil energy sources decrease day by day and go through to death point. While this process, fossil sources constitute the main source of green house gas and fast climate change. Today, at this point usage and spread of renewable energy Sources is taking place on the agenda of many countries. Wind energy systems have high learning curve value (92%) and when making comparison between wind energy and other renewable energy systems according to cost and efficiency parameter in that reason wind energy systems are more preferable. At the end of the 2008, global installed wind power was reached to 121000 MW and 158 million tones carbon dioxide emission was prevented with this installed power. According to Turkish Met office studies, mean temperature of Turkey has growing trend. Mean temperature of Turkey could be increase between 5 degrees C and 6 degrees C when comparing between 1961-1990 and 2071-2100 period. Energy production paradigm of Turkey is based on thermal conventional technology. In that reason CO(2) emission level was increased 74.4% between 1990 and 2004 in Turkey. This emission growth is a part of mean temperature increasing problem. Turkey wind energy potential is 47849 MW and nearly 62 million tones carbon dioxide emission could be prevented with this potential.",1
"Projected future climate change scenarios derived from two General Circulation Models (GCMs): Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO), and two crop models: Crop Estimation through Resources and Environmental Synthesis (CERES), and Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC), were considered to assess the climate change impact on the yield and biomass of maize. Climate change scenarios included changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation from two GCMs interpolated to 1 degrees x1 degrees grid cells in the central Piedmont in North Carolina. Changes in mean monthly temperature and precipitation from the GCMs were used to adjust observed daily climate records from 1949-1988. There is convincing evidence that future temperature linked to global warming might be characterized by asymmetric change between daily daytime maxima and daily nighttime minima. Two hypotheses regarding how GCM temperature would alter observational record were examined. The first hypothesis assumed that daytime and nighttime warming occurs symmetrically, i.e., maximum and minimum temperatures are raised equally. The second hypothesis assumed that nighttime minima change is three times greater than daytime maxima change and the change in mean diurnal temperature range is approximately equal to the change in daily mean temperature. For the equal day-night warming scenario, when only the effects of climate change (i.e., changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation) were considered, simulations with CERES and EPIC indicated substantial losses in maize grain yield and total above ground biomass with both the GCM scenarios. For the asymmetric warming, the reduction in biomass and yield due to climate change was less than that obtained with symmetric warming. Simulated maize yield and biomass with CERES and EPIC increased when only effects due to CO2-fertilization were considered. The inclusion of CO2 fertilization effects with those due to climate change resulted in higher biomass and yield compared to values obtained with effects of climate change alone. When CERES was used with the GFDL scenario, and the effects of CO2 fertilization and the climate change were combined, no difference in simulated yield was found between the two hypotheses; only an 8% difference in aboveground biomass was found when the UKMO scenario was used. When EPIC was used, the differential day-night warming hypothesis resulted in 9-13% less reduction in biomass and yield than did the use of the equal day-night warming hypothesis.

"Global climate change, such as that due to the proposed enhanced greenhouse effect, is likely to have a significant effect on biosphere-atmosphere interactions, including bushfire regimes. This study quantifies the possible impact of climate change on fire regimes by estimating changes in fire weather and the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FDI), an index that is used throughout Australia to estimate fire danger. The CSIRO 9-level general circulation model (CSIRO9 GCM) is used to simulate daily and seasonal fire danger for the present Australian climate and for a doubled-CO(2) climate. The impact assessment includes validation of the GCMs daily control simulation and the derivation of 'correction factors' which improve the accuracy of the fire danger simulation. In summary, the general impact of doubled-CO(2) is to increase fire danger at all sites by increasing the number of days of very high and extreme fire danger. Seasonal fire danger responds most to the large CO(2)-induced changes in maximum temperature.",1
"This study quantifies the relative impact on future ocean acidification of different aspects of global climate change mitigation policies, such as the year that global emissions peak, how fast they reduce after their peak, and the long term minimum emissions that are possible. Relative to a scenario where emissions peak in 2016 and then decrease by 1% per year, further emissions reductions to 2, 3 and 4% per year lead to the same impact minimum pH (by 2100) if emissions peak 10, 15 and 17 years later respectively. Over the same time scale, non-mitigation scenarios lead to a decrease of global mean surface pH of 7.67 to 7.8 Strong and urgent mitigation, emissions peaking in 2016 and reducing by 5% per year, are shown to limit this minimum to 8.02. Minimum pH over longer timescales, the next 500 years, is largely determined by the minimum emission level that is attainable, owing to its relation with cumulative emissions.

"Enteric methane accounts for 45 and 65% of total methane emissions, and is responsible for about 5% of global warming in France. The objective of the present paper was to update the annual enteric methane emissions by farm animals of the various categories in each involved species in France according to the recommendations of IPCC 2006 (Tier 3). Methane emissions have been assessed using the net energy requirements of animals converted to Metabolisable Energy Intake (MEI), and conversion factors (Y(m)' = kcal methane per 100 kcal MEI). Conversion factors and emission factors (kg methane/animal/y) were computed for the various species and categories of animals. The emission factor averaged 117.7 for dairy cows yielding 6300 kg milk/y, and ranged from 90 to 163 when milk yield increased from 3500 to 11 000 kg/y. It averaged 86.7 for beef cows, and 43.0 for ruminant growing cattle. The corresponding values were 14.4 and 11 for dairy and suckling ewes, 14.3 for goats, 20.7 for equines and 0.8 for pigs. Total enteric methane emissions in France amounted to 41 million tons. Dairy cows, beef cows and growing cattle contributed for 32-25 and 34%, respectively, to total methane enteric emission. Contributions of sheep, goats, equines and pigs were 6.2, 1, 5 and 0.8%, respectively, of total enteric methane emissions.",1
"Significant levels of methane are liberated from the coal face and subterranean pockets during coal mining. This methane poses an explosion hazard in mines and when released into the atmosphere, acts as a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. Methanotrophic bacteria in gas phase bioreactors (GPBs) offer the potential to convert this methane to less deleterious substances; however, it is critical that reaction rates be maximized. The effect of kaolin on rates of methane oxidation by Methylomonas methanica grown in GPBs was assessed. The amendment of GPBs with a 4% kaolin solution significantly increased methane removal by M. methaniea versus non-kaolin-amended controls. The maximum velocities (upsilon(max)) were 604.1 mg methane min-1 GPB-1 in the control compared to 1156.6 mg methane min-1 GPB-1 in the kaolin-amended bioreactors, while the Michaelis constants (K(m)) were 15.87 and 60.52 mg methane GPB-1, respectively.",1
"Six Italian research sites, representative of Mediterranean and mountain forests and equipped with eddy covariance towers, were used in this study to test the performance of the CENTURY 4.5 model in predicting the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) changes during the commitment periods (CP) of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012; 2013-2017). We show that changes in SOC stocks over short periods of time are difficult to detect, and explore the potential for models to be used for reporting SOC changes for forests that will remain forests, under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. As the eddy covariance flux sites have been active for 10 yr on average, being initiated over the period between 1996 and 1998, the model was evaluated by comparing the modelled SOC stocks with those directly measured at each site in different years. Since long term series of observed values for soil carbon were not available, the validation of other model outputs such as net primary production (NPP) and soil nitrogen stocks, gives some confidence in long term simulations. Once the model performance was evaluated, two climate change scenarios, A1F1 (world markets-fossil fuel intensive) and B2 (local sustainability), were considered for prediction of C stock changes during the commitment periods of the Kyoto Protocol. In general, despite the need to consider the uncertainties in the direct measurements, at each site model fit with measured SOC stocks was good, with the simulated values within the standard deviation of the measurements. In this regard, the similarity between the SOC measured in 2008 and that predicted for the two forthcoming commitment periods points out the difficulty of detecting carbon stock changes by direct measurements, given the closeness in time to the present of the commitment periods. In any case, all sites show positive variations that are possibly related to the fertilization effects of increasing CO(2) and to longer growing seasons, since no change in management occurred. Compared with the SOC measured in 2008, at the end of the second commitment period, the modelled SOC variations were smaller than 2% in the Mediterranean forests and comprised between 2% and 7% in the mountain forests. These variations, although small, indicate it might be possible to statistically detect differences after 10 yr in mountain forests with a reasonable number of samples. In conclusion, this work shows that since SOC stock changes are minimal within both CP, models can be effective tools for estimating future changes in SOC amounts, as an alternative to, or in support of, direct measurements when a short period of time is considered.",1
"A multi-fingerprint analysis is applied to the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate change. While a single fingerprint is optimal for the detection of climate change, further tests of the statistical consistency of the detected climate change signal with model predictions for different candidate forcing mechanisms require the simultaneous application of several fingerprints. Model-predicted climate change signals are derived from three anthropogenic global warming simulations for the period 1880 to 2049 and two simulations forced by estimated changes in solar radiation from 1700 to 1992. In the first global warming simulation, the forcing is by greenhouse gas only, while in the remaining two simulations the direct influence of sulfate aerosols is also included. From the climate change signals of the greenhouse gas only and the average of the two greenhouse gas-plus-aerosol simulations, two optimized fingerprint patterns are derived by weighting the model-predicted climate change patterns towards low-noise directions. The optimized fingerprint patterns are then applied as a filter to the observed near-surface temperature trend patterns, yielding several detection variables. The space-time structure of natural climate variability needed to determine the optimal fingerprint pattern and the resultant signal-to-noise ratio of the detection variable is estimated from several multi-century control simulations with different CGCMs and from instrumental data over the last 136 y. Applying the combined greenhouse gas-plus-aerosol fingerprint in the same way as the greenhouse gas only fingerprint in a previous work, the recent 30-y trends (1966-1995) of annual mean near surface temperature are again found to represent a significant climate change at the 97.5% confidence level. However, using both the greenhouse gas and the combined forcing fingerprints in a two-pattern analysis, a substantially better agreement between observations and the climate model prediction is found for the combined forcing simulation. Anticipating that the influence of the aerosol forcing is strongest for longer term temperature trends in summer, application of the detection and attribution test to the latest observed 50-y trend pattern of summer temperature yielded statistical consistency with the greenhouse gas-plus-aerosol simulation with respect to both the pattern and amplitude of the signal. In contrast, the observations are inconsistent with the greenhouse-gas only climate change signal at a 95% confidence level for all estimates of climate variability. The observed trend 1943-1992 is furthermore inconsistent with a hypothesized solar radiation change alone at an estimated 90% confidence level. Thus, in contrast to the single pattern analysis, the two pattern analysis is able to discriminate between different forcing hypotheses in the observed climate change signal. The results are subject to uncertainties associated with the forcing history, which is poorly known for the solar and aerosol forcing, the possible omission of other important forcings, and inevitable model errors in the computation of the response to the forcing. Further uncertainties in the estimated significance levels arise from the use of model internal variability simulations and relatively short instrumental observations (after subtraction of an estimated greenhouse gas signal) to estimate the natural climate variability. The resulting confidence limits accordingly vary for different estimates using different variability data. Despite these uncertainties, however, we consider our results sufficiently robust to have some confidence in our finding that the observed climate change is consistent with a combined greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing, but inconsistent with greenhouse gas or solar forcing alone.",1
"Air trapped in glacial ice offers a means of reconstructing variations in the concentrations of atmospheric gases over time scales ranging from anthropogenic (last 200 yr) to glacial/interglacial (hundreds of thousands of years), In this paper, we review the glaciological processes by which air is trapped in the ice and discuss processes that fractionate gases in ice cores relative to the contemporaneous atmosphere, We then summarize concentration-time records for CO2 and CH4 over the last 200 yr, Finally, we summarize concentration-time records for CO2 and CH4 during the last two glacial-interglacial cycles, and their relation to records of global climate change.",1
"Past studies have suggested that increasing atmospheric CO2 will lead to a significant reduction of soil moisture during summer in the extratropics. These studies showed an increase in wintertime rainfall over most mid-latitude continental regions when CO2 is doubled, an earlier snowmelt season and onset of springtime evaporation, and a higher ratio of evaporation to precipitation in summer. These factors led to large-scale increases in soil moisture in winter and decreases in summer. We find that the above processes are important in simulated summer drying in a newly developed climate model. In addition to these thermodynamic processes, we find that changes in atmospheric circulation play an important role in regional hydroclimatic changes. Additional experiments show that the atmospheric circulation changes are forced by the CO2-induced warming of the ocean, particularly the tropical ocean. These results highlight the importance of sea surface temperature changes for regional hydroclimatic changes.",1
"The response of natural vegetation to climate change is of global concern. In this research, an aggregated Holdridge Life Zone System was used to study the possible response of life zones in China under doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration with the input climatic parameters at 0.5 x 0.5degrees resolution of longitude and latitude from NCAR regional climate model 2 (RegCM2) coupled with the CSIRO global climate model. The results indicate that the latitudinal distribution of life zones would become irregular because of the complicated climate change. In particular, new life zones, such as subtropical desert (SD), tropical desert (TDE) and tropical thorn woodland (TTW), would appear. Subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest (SEBF), tropical rainforest and monsoon forest (TRIF), SD, TDE and TTW zones would appear in the northeastern China. Cool-temperate mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest (CMC) and warm-temperate deciduous broadleaved forest (WDBF) zones would appear at latitudes 25-35degreesN. The temperate desert (TD) in the western China would become Tibetan high-cold plateau (THP), SEBF, WDBF and temperate steppe (TS), and a large part of THP would be replaced by TRF, TDE, SEBF, TS and TTW. The relative area (distribution area/total terrestrial area) of CMC, TRF, TDE and TTW zone would increase about 3%, 21%, 3% and 6%, respectively. However, the relative area of SEBF, TS, TD and THP would decrease about 5%, 3%, 19% and 4%, respectively. In all, the relative area of forests (CCF, CMC, WDBF, SEBF, TRF) would increase about 15%, but the relative area of desert (TD, SD, TIDE, and TTW) and THP would decrease about 9% and 4%, respectively. Therefore, responses of different life zones in China to climate change would be dramatic, and nationwide corridors should be considered for the conservation of migrating species under climate change.

"Proper management and recycling of huge volumes of food waste is one of the challenges faced by Singapore. Semakau island - the only offshore landfill of the nation - only accepts inert, inorganic solid waste and therefore a large bulk of food waste is directed to incinerators. A remaining small percent is sent for recycling via anaerobic digestion (AD), followed by composting of the digestate material. This article investigates the environmental performance of four food waste conversion scenarios - based on a life cycle assessment perspective - taking into account air emissions, useful energy from the incinerators and AD process, as well as carbon dioxide mitigation from the compost products derived from the digestate material and a proposed aerobic composting system. The life cycle impact results were generated for global warming. acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidation and energy use. The total normalized results showed that a small-scale proposed aerobic composting system is more environmentally favorable than incinerators, but less ideal compared to the AD process. By making full use of the AD's Recycling Phase II process alone. the Singapore Green Plan's 2012 aim to increase the recycling of food waste to 30% can easily be achieved, along with reduced global warming impacts.

"To date, most of the focus on greenhouse gas emission reductions has been on energy-related CO2 emissions. This is understandable since CO2 emissions currently account for about 82 percent of the total US greenhouse gas emissions weighted by 100-year global warming potentials (EPA, www.epa.gov/globalwarming/publications/emissions, 2001a).(1) However, a number of analyses suggest that the non-CO2 greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol-methane, nitrous oxide, and the high-GWP (global warming potential) gases (HFCs, PFCs, and SF6)-can make a significant contribution to cost-effective emission reductions for the US and other countries. Our current estimate for the US is a reduction in non-CO2 emissions of 105 million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) at $50/ton carbon equivalent in 2010. This paper provides a perspective on the current and projected emissions of greenhouse gas; outlines the potential methods for achieving emissions reductions for various sources; and summarizes several recent studies on the cost of reductions for the US and other countries. Although the paper does not specifically address the potential for reductions of these gases in individual countries outside the US and the European Union, its findings are generally applicable to many countries.

"The need for accurate quantification of the amount of carbon stored in the environment has never been greater. Carbon sequestration has become a vital component of the battle against global climate change, and monitoring and quantifying this process are major challenges for policymakers. Plant allometric equations allow managers and scientists to quantify the biomass contained in a tree without cutting it down, and therefore can play a pivotal role in measuring carbon sequestration in forests and savannahs. These equations have been available since the beginning of the 20th century, but their usefulness depends on the ability to estimate the error associated with the equations - something which has received scant attention in the past. This paper provides a method based on the theory of linear regression and the lognormal distribution to derive confidence limits for estimates of biomass derived from plant allometric equations. Allometric equations for several southern African savannah species are provided, as well as the parameters and equations required to calculate the confidence intervals. This method was applied to data collected from a sampling campaign carried out in a savannah landscape at the Skukuza flux site, Kruger National Park, South Africa. Here the error was 10% of the total site biomass for the woody biomass and 2% for the leaf biomass. When the data were split into individual plots and used to estimate site biomass (as would occur in most sampling schemes) the error increased to 16% and 12% of the woody and leaf biomasses, respectively, as the sampling errors were added to the errors in the allometric equation. These methods can be used in any discipline that applies allometric equations, such as health sciences and animal physiology.",1
"Regional assessments of impacts due to global climate change are a high priority in the international programs on global-change research. Ill the polar regions, climate models indicate an amplification of global greenhouse warming, but there are large differences between the results of various models, and uncertainties about the magnitude and timing of the expected changes. Also, the observed high-latitude climate trends over the past few decades are much more regional and patchy than predicted by the models. As a first step in assessing possible climate impacts, model results are compared with observations of changes in temperature, precipitation, sea-ice extent, the permafrost regime and other cryospheric parameters. While considerable uncertainties remain in the long-term prediction of change, there is some agreement between model results and observed trends by season on shorter time-scales. The warming observed over the land masses of the Arctic over the past few decades is matched by corresponding observed decreases in snow cover and glacier mass balances, by thawing of the permafrost: and to a lesser degree by reductions in sea-ice extent. In Antarctica, warming in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions is associated with large decreases in ice-shelf areas and reduced ice thicknesses on the lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Major future impacts due to global greenhouse warming are likely to include permafrost thawing on land and its consequences for ecosystems and humans: changes in the productivity of marine ecosystems in the Arctic and Southern Ocean; economic impacts on fisheries; petroleum and other human activities; and social impacts on northern indigenous populations. Some of these impacts will have positive ramifications, but most are likely to be detrimental. While uncertainties exist about the future, climate change in the polar regions during the past few decades can he shown to have had major impacts already which will become much more pronounced if present trends continue.",1
"Concerns about climate change are global and real. As all communities try to get adapted to the challenges of their local climate, they are today sensitive to its variations. Third World countries, particularly Africa are threatened by the predicted effects of climate change because of their economic dependence on climate for development whose backbone is agriculture. There is strong evidence from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) that the observed increases in greenhouse gases particularly Carbon dioxide (CO2) may lead to global warming, sea level rise and space-time changes in climatic zones and seasons on the globe. To come up with climate change associated impacts on agriculture in Africa, the study evaluated climate related researches conducted on snow capped mountains in Africa (Mt Kilimanjaro), fishing in inland lakes (Lake Victoria, Baringo), Agriculture in the Semi-arid lands of East Africa and irrigation projects in Africa (Gezira in Egypt) It was established that Africa is already experiencing the devastating impacts of climate change as seen in frequent floods and droughts and shift in marginal agricultural systems. If the predicted temperature increase of 4.5 degrees centigrade is realized by the year 2030, then agricultural systems in Africa will be seriously affected particularly the food security section. There will be reduced land for agriculture because the high agricultural potential areas will become arid, Coastal areas will be submerged, affecting fishing and human settlement, there will be increased desertification and disappearance of ice and snow on the mountains. The effects of climate change may include: reduced agricultural land use due to submergence of coastal regions and increased aridity in the tropical high agricultural potential regions, there will be increased incidences of farm pests and diseases, over cultivation, food insecurity and poverty especially in Tropical regions. Africa will face serious challenges in her endeavor to adapt to new mechanisms of food production for sustainable development.",1
"This paper explores how South American farmers adapt to climate by changing crops. We develop a multinomial logit model of farmer's choice of crops. Estimating the model across 949 farmers in seven countries, we find that both temperature and precipitation affect the crops that South American farmers choose. Farmers choose fruits and vegetables in warmer locations and wheat and potatoes in cooler locations. Farms in wetter locations are more likely to grow rice, fruits, potatoes, and squash and in dryer locations maize and wheat. Global warming will cause South American farmers to switch away from maize, wheat, and potatoes towards squash, fruits and vegetables. Predictions of the impact of climate change on net revenue must reflect not only changes in yields per crop but also crop switching. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Agricultural production is thought to be a main anthropogenic emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O), which contributes to global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer. There is still considerable uncertainty about the amount of N2O emission, and the site-specific parameters that affect N2O emission. From October 1995 until March 1998 experiments were conducted at established field plots (true meadows) at three different sites, i.e. low mountain range (Eifel), lowland (Niederrhein), and moist meadows (Munsterland). Plots were fertilized with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) at nitrogen equivalents ranging from 0 to 360 kg N ha(-1). N2O fluxes were measured throughout the whole year using the closed-chamber method. In addition, data on temperature, water-filled pore space and precipitation were collected. N2O emission rates (mg N2O-N ha(-1) h(-1)) were highest either after fertilizer application or in winter during frost, depending on the experimental site and N dosage. The annual amount of N losses clue to N2O emission was dependent on the experimental site and the type and dosage of fertilizer. Disregarding the 360 kg N ha (1) level of the CAN treatments, the N losses in this experiment were less than 5 kg N2O-N ha (1) yr (1). At low fertilizer dosage there was no reliable correlation between the amount of N that was applied and the amount of N2O that was emitted. However, with high fertilizer levels the N2O emissions increased gradually. Finally, N2O emissions were more influenced by the amount of CAN than by the site.",1
"An ocean sequestration method to dispose of a large amount Of CO2 gas has been developed to mitigate global warming. This system is called the gas lift advanced dissolution (GLAD) system. This system works by dissolving CO2 gas into seawater at a depth of 200-300. The CO2-rich seawater is then transported to a depth greater than 1000 m. This system is composed of short riser pipes for gas-lift and CO2 dissolution, a tank for separating indissoluble gas ingredients from seawater, and long down-comers for transporting CO2-rich seawater to great depths. For the system to function optimally, the riser pipe needs lobe long and wide enough to dissolve CO2 thoroughly. Also the down-comer has to be long enough to transport the CO2-rich seawater to great depths and sufficiently large in diameter to enable transportation of large quantities of seawater. The most important aspect for disposal Of CO2 into the ocean is minimizing the environmental impact, especially its influence on marine life. The CO2 concentration of seawater, therefore, must be limited below a certain value in order to minimize the environmental impact. This paper describes a mathematical model of GLAD's internal flow, which was derived to optimize the system specifications, and the correlations among the design factors of GLAD system derived by using this mathematical model.

"As demand for electricity increases, investments into new generation capacity from renewable and nonrenewable sources should include assessment of global (climate) change consequences not just of the operational phase of the power plants but construction effects as well. In this paper, the global warming effect (GWE) associated with construction and operation of comparable hydroelectric, wind, solar, coal, and natural gas power plants is estimated for four time periods after construction. The assessment includes greenhouse gas emissions from construction, burning of fuels, flooded biomass decay in the reservoir, loss of net ecosystem production, and land USE. The results indicate that a wind farm and a hydroelectric plant in an arid zone (such as the Glen Canyon in the Upper Colorado River Basin) appear to have lower GWE than other power plants. For the Glen Canyon hydroelectric plant, the upgrade 20 yr after the beginning of operation increased power capacity by 39% but resulted in a mere 1% of the CO2 emissions from the initial construction and came with no additional emissions from the reservoir, which accounts for the majority of the GWE.",1
"Deforestation in Amazonia seems likely to continue in the 21st century, and fire risk could increase as a result of global climate change. With deforestation activities providing a source of ignition, the combination of this with increased fire risk could lead to widespread impacts on Amazonian ecosystems. This would also contribute further to climate change through feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. This study uses the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index and an ensemble of variants of the HadCM3 climate model to simulate potential changes to fire risk in Amazonia over the 21st century. Significant increases in central and eastern Amazonia are simulated by 2020, and high fire danger for over 50% of the forest is simulated in all model runs by 2080. By 2080, as much as 25% of Amazonia shows high levels of agreement in projections of combined fire risk and deforestation. The areas simulated with high fire danger are also those projected to be impacted most significantly by deforestation. If the regional climate changes simulated for Amazonia by HadCM3 are realistic, the risk of significant forest damage could become high, and deforestation activities could, therefore, have a greater potential for impacting on wider areas of forest.",1
"This work shows that carbon dioxide, which is a main contributor to the global warming effect, could be utilized as a selective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The modification of the catalytically active vanadium oxide component with appropriate amounts of antimony oxide led to more stable catalytic performance along with a higher styrene yield (76%) at high styrene selectivity (> 95%). The improved catalytic behavior was attributable to the enhanced redox properties of the active V-sites.",1
"Strontium isotope stratigraphy of shallow-water carbonates from the southern Apennines (Italy) indicates that the late Cenomanian-early Turonian evolution of marine Sr-87/Sr-86 is not accurately depicted by the marine reference curve. Using the low-Mg biotic calcite of well-preserved rudist shells as a study material and carbon isotope stratigraphy for correlation to the standard ammonite biozonal scheme of Northern Europe, new Sr-87/Sr-96 values are proposed for four different stratigraphic levels: the middle and uppermost part of the guerangeri zone, the lower and upper part of the geslinianum zone. The southern Apennines data suggest that a sharp positive shift at the onset of oceanic anoxic event 2 precedes the well-known Sr isotope negative shift. The positive shift is interpreted in terms of enhanced rates of chemical weathering, driven by global warming forced by volcanogenic CO2 outgassing. A stratified ocean is invoked to reconcile the high gradient and the short lag time of the perturbation with estimates of present-day total mass and residence time of strontium in the ocean. The sharp switch to the negative shift is related to the collapse of water-column density gradient, driven by thermal instability during a late Cenomanian cool event. More active ocean circulation suddenly delivered to surface waters the signal of increased submarine volcanism that had accumulated in deep waters. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Since the 1980s, biologists have noticed a major decline in amphibian population. The reason this is so alarming is because amphibians have been seen as a ""Canary in the mine"" when it comes to the world's environmental changes. With global warming and CO(2) emissions all over the news, we have become more aware of how we are impacting our world. If the decline of amphibians is a precursor to what is happening with the environment, then we need to find a good model to give us estimates on what is going to happen in the future. Here we used a predator-prey-competition model to help investigate how three amphibians might interact when confined to the same area. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",1
"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an environmental assessment method that has come into wide use. The LCA method has been used to assess the environmental impact of various products from domestic articles like plastic trays to large buildings. However, few LCA studies on domestic lumber have been conducted because of regional and other differences in forestry methods, distribution, etc. In this study, to obtain basic knowledge on the environmental impact of sugi lumber products, we investigated energy consumption, amount of waste, and volume of product in processes from felling to sawmilling. From the obtained data, emissions of environmental load substances were quantified and evaluated by LCA. The main results obtained are as follow: CO2, CO, NOx, and SO2 were emitted in large quantities from the sawmill subprocess. This is probably due to the large electricity consumption of sawmill equipment. The amount Of CO2 emissions depends on the yield of the sawmill and the distance from market of the sawn-till. Therefore, effective means to reduce the CO2 emissions were suggested as follow: the sawmill equipment can be rationalized to improve the yield in sawmill subprocess, and the sawmilling line can be made more highly effective; in addition, it is important to plan construction of sawmills so that the distance from the sawmill to the market will be shortest. Global warming and acidification comprise almost the entire result of the impact assessment of both sawmills. The substances that contributed to global warming and acidification were CO2, NOx, SO2(,) and CH4 and each substance was emitted most in the sawmill subprocess. Overall, this study showed that the sawmill subprocess has the greatest role in the environmental load of lumber products.",1
"It has been recognized worldwide that the utilization of an enormous amount of fossil fuel has created various adverse effects on the environment, including acid rain and global warming. An increase in average global temperatures of approximately 0.56 K has been measured over the past century. This increase is called global climate change or global warming. The gases with three or more atoms that have higher heat capacities than those of O-2 and N-2 cause the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a main greenhouse gas associated with global climate change. Nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methane (CH4) are other important greenhouse gases. Collectively, they are projected to contribute, directly, about as much potential global warming over the next 60 years as CO2. Three trace gases, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6, would be regulated under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol because of their global warming potential and for their potential growth of concentrations in the atmosphere. HFCs have been widely approved as substitutes for CFCs.",1
"Global warming due to greenhouse effect is expected to cause major changes in climate of some areas. The change in climate is likely to have a profound effect on hydrological cycle viz. precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture etc. Evapotranspiration (ET) being the major component of hydrological cycle will affect crop water requirement and future planning and management of water resources. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to global warming for arid regions of Rajasthan (India). The Penman-Monteith equation was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration, and sensitivity of ET has been studied in terms of change in temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and vapor pressure within a possible range of +/-20% from the normal long-term meteorological parameters of 32 years (1971-2002). Changes in precipitation and stomatal resistance to increased CO2 concentration have not been considered in the present study. The study suggests an increase of 14.8% of total ET demand with increase in temperature by 20% (maximum 8degreesC). ET is less sensitive (11%) to increase in net solar radiation, followed by wind speed (7%) in comparison to temperature. Increase in vapor pressure (20%) has a small negative effect on ET (-4.31%). A 10% increase in temperature and actual vapor pressure coupled with 10% decrease in net solar radiation could result even in marginal decrease of total ET (0.30%). Increase of 10% in temperature alone, with 10% decrease in net solar radiation, actual vapor pressure and wind velocity could also result in marginal decrease in total ET (0.36%). A marginal increase in ET demand due to global warming will have a larger impact on resource-poor, fragile arid zone ecosystem of Rajasthan. It is high time for planners/users to think in terms of expected change in water requirement due to global warming while planning for development of future water resources in the arid region of Rajasthan. A wide spectrum climate change scenario is discussed in the paper as guideline for future development of water resources. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"It is generally believed that increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases as a result of man's activities are leading to global warming. It is also believed that the same activities lead to increasing concentrations of sulphate aerosol, which act to cool the climate system and ameliorate the warming. The sulphate cooling may be separated into the direct effect in cloud-free regions and the indirect effect in cloudy regions. This paper summarizes recent work at the Hadley Centre on the indirect effect. Results from two versions of the Hadley Centre Climate Model are shown, using various parameterizations linking the amount of sulphate aerosol and the number concentration of droplets in water clouds. These results illustrate the considerable uncertainties in estimating the indirect effect. It is shown that other naturally occurring components of the aerosol population, in particular sea salt, may be important in reducing the magnitude of the indirect effect.",1
"Climatic influence (global warming and decreased rainfall) could lead to an increase in the ecological and toxicological effects of the pollution in aquatic ecosystems, especially contamination from agricultural nitrate (NO(3)(-)) fertilizers. Physicochemical properties of the surface waters and sediments of four selected sites varying in NO(3)(-) concentration along La Rocina Stream, which feeds Marisma del Rocio in Donana National Park (South West, Spain), were studied. Electrical conductivity, pH, content in macro and microelements, total organic carbon and nitrogen, and dissolved carbon and nitrogen were affected by each sampling site and sampling time. Contaminant NO(3)(-) in surface water at the site with the highest NO(3)(-) concentration (ranged in 66-106.6 mg L(-1)) was of inorganic origin, most probably from chemical fertilizers, as determined chemically (90% of the total dissolved nitrogen from NO(3)(-)) and by isotopic analysis of delta(15)N-NO(3)(-). Changes in seasonal weather conditions and hydrological effects at the sampling sites were also responsible for variations in some biological activities (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid phosphatase and urease) in sediments, as well as in the production of the greenhouse gases CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O. Both organic matter and NO(3)(-) contents influenced rates of gas production. Increased NO(3)(-) concentration also resulted in enhanced levels of potential denitrification measured as N(2)O production. The denitrification process was affected by NO(3)(-) contamination and the rainfall regimen, increasing the greenhouse gases emissions (CO(2), CH(4) and especially N(2)O) during the driest season in all sampling sites studied.

"This paper presents results of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis and experimental investigation of an ejector refrigeration system using methanol as the working fluid. The CFD modelling was used to investigate the effect of the relative position of the primary nozzle exit within the mixing chamber on the performance of the ejector. The results of the CFD were used to obtain the optimum geometry of the ejector, which was then used to design, construct and test a small-scale experimental ejector refrigeration system. Methanol was used as the working fluid, as it has the advantage of being an 'environmentally friendly' refrigerant that does not contribute to global warming and ozone layer depletion. In addition, use of methanol allows the ejector refrigeration system to produce cooling at temperatures below the freezing point of the water, which of course would not be possible with a water ejector refrigeration system. CFD results showed that positioning the nozzle exit at least 0.21 length of the mixing chamber throat's diameter upstream of the entrance of the mixing chamber gave better performance than pushing it into the mixing chamber. Experimental values of coefficient of performance (COP) between 0.2 and 0.4 were obtained at operating conditions achievable using low-grade heat such as solar energy and waste heat.

"Methyl chloride, CH3Cl, and methyl bromide, CH3Br, are particularly important in the global atmosphere as major natural sources of chlorine and bromine to the stratosphere. The production of these gases is dominated by natural sources, but smaller, important anthropogenic sources, such as agricultural fumigation and/or biomass burning, also exist. As absorbers of infrared radiation these gases are of interest for their potential effect on the tropospheric energy balance as well as for chemical interactions. In this study we estimate the radiative forcing and Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) of CH3Cl and CH3Br. Our calculations use an infrared radiative transfer model based on the correlated k-distribution algorithm for band absorption. Radiative forcing values of 0.0047 W/m(2) per part per billion by volume (ppbv) for CH3Cl in the troposphere and 0.0049 W/m(2) per ppbv for CH3Br in the troposphere were obtained. On a per molecule basis the radiative forcing values are about 2% of the forcing of CFC II and about 270 times the forcing of CO2. GWPs for these gases are about 8 for CH3Cl and about 4 for CH3Br (100 year time integration, CO2 = 1). These results indicate that while CH3Cl and CH3Br have direct GWPs similar to that of CH4, the current emission rates are too low to contribute meaningfully to atmospheric greenhouse heating effects.",1
"Tropical peatlands are important sources and sinks of atmospheric methane (CH4) and major sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Recently, large areas of tropical peatland have been developed for agriculture plantations in Southeast Asia whereby drainage is a prerequisite, which can increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions substantially and therefore, global warming potential (GWP). Despite this, there is still a paucity of knowledge on GHG emissions from different ecosystems on tropical peatland and their roles and contribution to the global gas budget. Thus, three ecosystems from tropical peatland of Sarawak, Malaysia, mixed peatswamp forest, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantation and sago (Metroxylon sagu) plantation, were chosen for the study of GHG emissions from the soils to determine their contribution towards GWP. The GHG emissions were measured monthly over 12 months using a closed chamber technique. GWP from forest soils was higher (7850 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) compared with oil palm ecosystem (5706 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) and sago ecosystem (4233 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1)). A high GWP in forest ecosystem was due to its high soil respiration rate of 7817 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1). Soil respiration rates for sago and oil palm were 4074 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) and 5652 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) respectively. About 4 % of GWP from peat soils in sago ecosystem was due to CH4 (5.5 9 CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) and N2O (153.4 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1)) emissions, which were negligible in forest and oil palm ecosystems. Thus, the GWP of the soils in the three ecosystems on tropical peatland were mainly dominated by CO2 fluxes from the soil implying that tropical peatlands may function as a source for atmospheric CO2 on a global scale.",1
"The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Moreover, rates of genetic adaptation and/or changes in the coral-zooxanthella partnerships are considered unlikely to be sufficiently fast for corals to acquire increased physiological resistance to increasing sea temperatures and declining pH. However, it has been suggested that coral reef resilience to climate change may be improved by good local management of coral reefs, including management of water quality. Here, using major data sets from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, we investigate geographic patterns of coral bleaching in 1998 and 2002 and outline a synergism between heat stress and nutrient flux as a major causative mechanism for those patterns. The study provides the first concrete evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of coral reefs to global climate change.",1
"Increasing atmospheric CO2 is recognized as a major aspect of global climate change that would have a significant impact on the productivity of major agricultural crops. Two field experiments were done, with the objective of quantifying the response of a short-duration rice (Oryza sativa ) variety (BG-300) to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, in the low elevation, subhumid zone of Sri Lanka. The experiment contained three treatments. In the elevated CO2 treatment, rice was grown at a CO2 concentration of 570 mumol/mol within open top chambers (OTC s). The ambient CO2 treatment included crops grown within OTC s, but maintained at the ambient CO2 concentration of 370 mumol/mol. The third treatment was a crop grown in the open field under ambient CO2 concentration. Grain yields of rice crops grown under elevated CO2 were 24 % and 39 % greater than the respective ambient treatments in the maha (January - March 2001) and yala (May - August, 2001) seasons. Significant increases in total biomass at harvest (23 % and 39 %, respectively, in maha and yala ) were more responsible for the above yield increases than the slight increases in the harvest index (4 % and 2 %). Yields of the ambient and open field treatments did not differ significantly. Among the yield components, the number of panicles per hill was significantly higher in the elevated treatment and showed significant positive correlations with grain yield in both seasons. In addition, grain yield showed significant positive correlations with the percentage of filled grains in maha and the number of grains per panicle in yala . Significant increases in the number of tillers per hill under elevated CO2 were responsible for its greater leaf area index and the greater numbers of panicles per hill. Crops under elevated CO2 accumulated biomass faster than those grown under ambient CO2 during the vegetative and grain-filling stages. The results of this study demonstrate that elevated CO2 causes significant yield increases in rice, even when it is grown in warm, subhumid tropical climates.",1
"Recent studies indicated that municipal solid waste (MSW) is a major contributor to global warming due to extensive emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, most of them focused on investigating impacts of MSW on GHG emission amounts. This study presents two mixed integer bilevel decision-making models for integrated municipal solid waste management and GHG emissions control: MGU-MCL and MCU-MGL The MGU-MCL model represents a top-down decision process, with the environmental sectors at the national level dominating the upper-level objective and the waste management sectors at the municipal level providing the lower-level objective. The MCU-MGL model implies a bottom-up decision process where municipality plays a leading role. Results from the models indicate that: the top-down decisions would reduce metric tonne carbon emissions (MTCEs) by about 59% yet increase about 8% of the total management cost; the bottom-up decisions would reduce MTCE emissions by about 13% but increase the total management cost very slightly; on-site monitoring and downscaled laboratory experiments are still required for reducing uncertainty in GHG emission rate from the landfill facility.

"Although anthropogenic influences such as global warming, overfishing, and eutrophication may contribute to jellyfish blooms, little is known about the effects of ocean acidification on jellyfish. Most medusae form statoliths of calcium sulfate hemihydrate that are components of their balance organs (statocysts). This study was designed to test the effects of pH (7.9, within the average current range, 7.5, expected by 2100, and 7.2, expected by 2300) combined with two temperatures (9 and 15 degrees C) on asexual reproduction and statolith formation of the moon jellyfish, Aurelia labiata. Polyp survival was 100% after 122 d in seawater in all six temperature and pH combinations. Because few polyps at 9 degrees C strobilated, and temperature effects on budding were consistent with published results, we did not analyze data from those three treatments further. At 15 degrees C, there were no significant effects of pH on the numbers of ephyrae or buds produced per polyp or on the numbers of statoliths per statocyst; however, statolith size was significantly smaller in ephyrae released from polyps reared at low pH. Our results indicate that A. labiata polyps are quite tolerant of low pH, surviving and reproducing asexually even at the lowest tested pH; however, the effects of small statoliths on ephyra fitness are unknown. Future research on the behavior of ephyrae with small statoliths would further our understanding of how ocean acidification may affect jellyfish survival in nature.",1
"During the last four decades, 16 Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) and 4 Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) have been constructed and operated in Korea, and nuclear fuel technology has been developed to a self-reliant state. At first, the PWR fuel design and manufacturing technology was acquired through international cooperation with a foreign partner. Then, the PWR fuel R&D by Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) has improved fuel technology to a self-reliant state in terms of fuel elements, which includes a new cladding material, a large-grained UO(2) pellet, a high performance spacer grid, a fuel rod performance code, and fuel assembly test facility. The MOX fuel performance analysis code was developed and validated using the in-reactor test data. MOX fuel test rods were fabricated and their irradiation test was completed by an international program. At the same time, the PWR fuel development by Korea Nuclear Fuel (KNF) has produced new fuel assemblies such as PLUS7 and ACET During this process, the design and test technology of fuel assemblies was developed to a self-reliant state. The PHWR fuel manufacturing technology was developed and manufacturing facility was Set up by KAERI, independently from the foreign technology. Then, the advanced PHWR fuel, CANFLEX(CANDU Flexible Fuelling), was developed, and an irradiation test was completed in a PHWR. The development of the CANFLEX fuel included a new design of fuel rods and bundles.. The nuclear fuel technology in Korea has been steadily developed in many national R&D programs, and this advanced fuel technology is expected to contribute to a worldwide nuclear renaissance that can create solutions to global warming.",1
"Results are presented from a present-day and a doubled CO2 experiment over the Alpine region with a nested regional climate model. The simulated temperature change signal shows a substantial elevation dependency, mostly during the winter and spring seasons, resulting in more pronounced waring at high elevations than low elevations. This is caused by a depletion of snowpack in doubled CO2 conditions and further enhanced by the snow-albedo feedback. This result is consistent with some observed temperature trends for anomalously warm years over the Alpine region and suggests that high elevation temperature changes could be used as an early detection tool for global warming. Changes in precipitation, as well as other components of the surface energy and water budgets, also show an elevation signal, which may have important implications for impact assessments in high elevation regions.",1
"In this paper MARKAL-MACRO, an integrated energy-environment-economy model, is used to generate China's reference scenario for future energy development and carbon emission through the year 2050. The results show that with great efforts on structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement and energy substitution, China's primary energy consumption is expected to be 4818 Mtce and carbon emission 2394 MtC by 2050 with annual decrease rate of 3% for the carbon intensity per GDP during the period 2000-2050. On the basis of this reference scenario, China's marginal abatement cost curves of carbon for the year 2010, 2020 and 2030 are derived from the model, and the impacts of carbon emission abatement on GDP are also simulated. The results are compared with those from other sources. The research shows that the marginal abatement costs vary from 12USS/tC to 216USS/tC and the rates of GDP losses relative to reference range from 0.1% to 2.54% for the reduction rates between 5% and 45%. Both the marginal abatement costs and the rates of GDP losses further enlarge on condition that the maximum capacity of nuclear power is constrained to 240GW or 160GW by 2050. The paper concludes that China's costs of carbon abatement is rather high in case of carbon emissions are further cut beyond the reference scenario, and China's carbon abatement room is limited due to her coal-dominant energy resource characteristic. As economic development still remains the priority and per capita income as well as per capita carbon emission are far below the world average, it will be more realistic for China to make continuous contribution to combating global climate change by implementing sustainable development strategy domestically and playing an active role in the international carbon mitigation cooperation mechanisms rather than accepting a carbon emission ceiling.

"The contribution of existing municipal solid waste management to emission of greenhouse gases and file alternative scenarios to reduce emissions were analyzed for Data Ganj Bukhsh Town (DGBT) in Lahore. Pakistan using file life cycle assessment methodology. DGBT has a population of 1,624.169 people living ill 232,024 dwellings. Total waste generated is 500,000 tons per),car with in average per capita rate of 0.84 kg per day. Alternative scenarios were developed and evaluated according to the environmental, economic. and social atmosphere of file study area. Solid waste management options considered include the collection and transportation of waste. collection of recyclables with single and mixed material bank container systems (SMBCS, MMBCS). material recovery facilities (MRF). composting, biogasification and landfilling. A life cycle inventory (LCI) of the six scenarios along with file baseline scenario was completed; this helped to quantify the CO(2) equivalents, emitted and avoided, for energy consumption. production. fuel consumption and methane (CH(4)) emissions. LCI results showed that file contribution of the baseline scenario to the global warming potential as CO(2) equivalents Was a maximum of 838,116 toils. The sixth scenario had a maximum reduction of GHG emissions in terms of CO(2) equivalents of -33,773 tons, but the most workable scenario for file current situation ill file study area is scenario 5. It saves 25% ill CO(2) equivalents compared to the baseline scenario. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are thought to be one cause of global warming. Current methods for CO2 capture result in large energy penalties. Solid adsorbents are a potential method to capture CO2, but the sorbent-sorbate affinity is critical in determining the energetic viability of such processes. In this study, the adsorption of CO2 in a range of microporous organic polymers was tested. These materials adsorb up to 2.20 mmol/g CO2 at 298 K and 1 bar, and thus performance is compared with related porous solids in the literature. The relationship between CO2 uptake and apparent surface area and pore size is described, and this showed that heats of adsorption were important in the low pressure regime. The chemical tuning of gas-sorbent affinity provides a blueprint for the development of improved materials in this area.",1
"Global climate change is one of the most serious global environmental problems faced by humankind at present. Serious attention should be paid and precautions should be taken before disasters occur. The amount of CO(2) emissions in China has increased during the past few years and the Chinese government and people have attached great importance to this phenomenon and treated it seriously. With the instruction of scientific development viewpoint, Beijing has made significant progress in emissions reduction through technological innovation, industrial structure adjustment, promoting energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy, and absorption of CO(2) using forest and wetland, since bidding for Olympic Games. At the same time, energy conservation and emissions reduction measures taken in the construction of Beijing Olympic stadiums just incarnate the Beijing Green Olympics. Using the Beijing Olympic Games as a turning-point, adopting energy conservation and emissions reduction measures, Beijing will make contributions to reduction of greenhouse gases and slowing down climate changes and Beijing Olympic Games will leave behind an inheritance for future generations to enjoy.

"NatureWorks(TM) polylactide (PLA)(1) is a versatile polymer produced by Cargill Dow LLC. Cargill Dow is building a global platform of sustainable polymers and chemicals entirely made from renewable resources. Cargill Dow's business philosophy is explained including the role of life cycle assessment (LCA), a tool used for measuring environmental sustainability and identifying environmental performance-improvement objectives. The paper gives an overview of applications of LCA to PLA production and provides insight into how they are utilized. The first application reviews the contributions to the gross. fossil energy requirement for PLA (54 MJ/kg). In the second one PLA is compared with petrochemical-based polymers using fossil energy use, global warming and water use as the three impact indicators. The last application gives more details about the potential reductions in energy use and greenhouse gasses. Cargill Dow's 5-8 year objective is to decrease the fossil energy use from 54 MJ/kg PLA down to about 7 MJ/kg PLA. The objective for greenhouse gasses is a reduction from +8 down to -7 kg CO2 equivalents/kg PLA. (C) 2003 Cargill Dow B.V. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",1
"Elevated ocean temperatures can cause coral bleaching, the loss of colour from reef-building corals because of a breakdown of the symbiosis with the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Recent studies have warned that global climate change could increase the frequency of coral bleaching and threaten the long-term viability of coral reefs. These assertions are based on projecting the coarse output from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) to the local conditions around representative coral reefs. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive global assessment of coral bleaching under climate change by adapting the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching prediction method to the output of a low- and high-climate sensitivity GCM. First, we develop and test algorithms for predicting mass coral bleaching with GCM-resolution sea surface temperatures for thousands of coral reefs, using a global coral reef map and 1985-2002 bleaching prediction data. We then use the algorithms to determine the frequency of coral bleaching and required thermal adaptation by corals and their endosymbionts under two different emissions scenarios. The results indicate that bleaching could become an annual or biannual event for the vast majority of the world's coral reefs in the next 30-50 years without an increase in thermal tolerance of 0.2-0 degrees C per decade. The geographic variability in required thermal adaptation found in each model and emissions scenario suggests that coral reefs in some regions, like Micronesia and western Polynesia, may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Advances in modelling and monitoring will refine the forecast for individual reefs, but this assessment concludes that the global prognosis is unlikely to change without an accelerated effort to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.",1
"Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions from a rice-duck cultivation system in the subtropical region of China and its regulating factors were investigated by using a static chambers technique during rice growth seasons in 2006 and 2007. The experimental field was equally divided into six plots for two different treatments: One was a conventional rice field (CK) and the other was a rice-duck ecosystem (RD). With the same amount of urea applied as basal fertilization, N(2)O emission fluxes from RD and CK followed a similar seasonal variation trend. During the flooding seasons, the N(2)O emission flux was not correlated with temperature, but it was significantly related to soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN) (p < 0.01) and soil pH (p < 0.01). After drainage, the N(2)O emission flux was not correlated with temperature, SIN, and soil pH. Our experimental data showed that peaks of N(2)O emission flux occurred both in 2 weeks after urea application and after drainage. Compared to CK, RD could significantly increase N(2)O emission. We evaluated the integrated global warming potentials (GWPs) of a rice-duck cultivation system based on methane (CH(4)) and N(2)O emission, which showed that RD could suppress the total amount of CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from rice paddies. Moreover, because the decrease of CH(4) emissions from RD compared to CK was far more than the increase of N(2)O emissions from RD compared to CK, RD greatly reduced integrated GWPs (CH(4) + N(2)O) compared to CK. So, the rice-duck cultivation system is an effective strategy for reducing integrated GWPs of the rice-duck cultivation systems based on CH(4) and N(2)O in southern China and will contribute to alleviating global warming.",1
"Growing concern over anthropogenic global climate change has intensified the need to develop accurate budgets of atmospheric methane and other greenhouse gases. Globally, flooded rice cultivation represents a major source of atmospheric methane that is expected to grow with human population. However, current estimates of global methane flux from rice paddies vary by roughly 50%. Understanding the sources of this large variability is critical for developing management strategies for atmospheric methane. Using data collected each growing season from Texas, USA, rice paddies over a 9-year period we examined the spatial and temporal sources of methane flux variability. Using standard deviation of the mean methane flux as a measured of variability, we found that accounting for rice plant height and grain yield reduced spatial variability from 25.2 to 17.7% of the mean. Temporal variability over the entire 9-year data set was 49% of the mean, 71% of which was explained by variations in average rice plant height and total nitrogen fertilizer application. The magnitude of temporal and spatial variability suggests that reliance on single-field studies for determination of global methane budgets may be questionable.",1
"In the near future, forest tree species growing in eastern Canada are expected to be affected by climate change due to an increase of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, models were developed to estimate the impact of climate change on growth in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Data were collected in a genecological test replicated in three locations, and involving 45 distinct geographical seed sources. most of them represented by five open-pollinated families. Transfer models predicting the performance of seed sources were developed, based on temperature and precipitation differentials between the geographical origin of seed sources and die experimental site locations. These models were validated using data collected in a second genecological test series. We found that white spruce populations located within the sampled area were optimally adapted to their local environment for thermal conditions but not for moisture conditions: populations that originated from sites receiving, more precipitation generally showed higher tree growth than the local sources. We predict that the adaptive lag currently related to precipitation will increase under global warming conditions. Simulations of growth under various scenarios of climate change indicated that it would be diminished tangibly under more intense warming. However, for a given temperature increase. the relative loss in growth will be less if precipitation is reduced than if it increases. Consequently, predictions based solely on temperature change appear inaccurate, and more effort should be directed toward better anticipating the magnitude and the direction of changes in precipitation patterns at the regional scale. The necessity of human intervention to assist tree migration under climate change is examined. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"The free radical reactions occuring in the sunlit troposphere involving methane, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, ozone and water vapour, generate a distribution of hydroxyl radicals which play a major role in removing many of the trace gases emitted by human activities. The United Kingdom Meteorological Office two-dimensional (altitude and latitude) chemistry transport model is used to describe the trace gas life cycles and the fast photochemistry and hence to calculate the distribution of hydroxyl radicals. The mean concentration of hydroxyl radicals estimated in the lowest 0-12 km of the atmosphere is 2 x 10(6) molecules cm(-3) (0.74 x 10(6) molecules cm(-3) over 0-24 km). This concentration is in good agreement with estimates based on the OH radical concentrations required to balance the budgets of methyl chloroform and (CO)-C-14. The two-dimensional model was used to investigate the likely future methane concentrations that would build up in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IS92a emission scenario over the period up to the year 2050. Because of the decrease in likely future OH radical concentrations due to the influence of human activities, methane concentrations build up significantly faster than emissions. There are therefore important consequences for global warming from human interference in the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere.",1
"Based on the reanalysis data throughout 1948-2002 as derived from the United States National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research, it is revealed that East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensity weakens on an interdecadal timescale since the mid-1960s, and twice interdecadal jumps are recorded in the EASM intensity index series in the late 20th century, respectively occurring in the mid-1960s and mid- to late 1970s. Six globally coupled atmosphere-ocean models' outputs under the SIZES A2 greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenario, provided by the IPCC Data Distribution Center and the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research, are then systematically examined. It follows that the above EASM weakening is not closely related to synchronizing anthropogenic global warming, and, therefore, it should be qualitatively natural change process. Over the 21st century, the EASM intensity is likely increased slightly by continually intensified greenhouse effect relative to the late 20th century.",1
"For the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide to prevent global warming, the phase equilibrium data for water and carbon dioxide mixture play an important role in process design and operation. In this work, the nonrandom lattice fluid equation of state with hydrogen bonding (NLF-HB EOS) was applied for the prediction of phase equilibrium of mixtures containing water and carbon dioxide. A new set of pure component parameters for carbon dioxide above critical condition was found and optimum binary interaction parameters were reported to correlate mutual solubility of mixtures. The calculated results were compared with the Peng-Robinson Equation of State with the conventional mixing rule (PR-EOS) and the Wong-Sandler mixing rule (PR-WS-EOS). The calculation results show that NLF-HB EOS can correlate mutual solubility of water+carbon dioxide mixtures with reasonable accuracy within a single theoretical framework.",1
"Fears of climate change and increasing concern over the global warming have prompted a search for new, cleaner methods for electricity power generation. Technologies based on utilising biomass are attracting much attention because biomass is considered to be CO2 neutral. Co-firing of biomass fuels with coal, for example, is presently being considered as a mean for reducing the global CO2 emissions. Biomass is also applied in thermal conversion processes to produce fuels with higher calorific values and adsorbents. In any case, thermal decomposition is essential stage where volatiles and tars are evolved followed by consequent heats of reactions. In this work sawdust biomass samples were selected in order to study their thermal conversion behaviour. Heats of decomposition for each sample were measured during continuous heating at a prescribed heating rate under inert atmospheric conditions. The decomposition generally commenced in all samples at 150 degreesC and was completed at 460 degreesC in a series of endo and exothermic reactions influenced by its lignin and cellulosic content. Single biomass sample was subjected to heating rates ranging from 10 to 1000 degreesC min(-1) and the effect of heating rate on decomposition was studied. The origin of reactions for each thermal sequence is herein discussed in detail.",1
"Recent life cycle assessment studies have revealed the relevance of cooling agent leakage when assessing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by fishing vessel operations. The goal of this communication is to update the carbon footprinting of the Galician fishing activity (NW Spain) by including the GHG emissions from cooling agent leakage. Results proved the relevant role played by refrigerants regarding their contribution to the carbon footprint of fishing activities. Thus, an overall increase of 13% was found when comparing the final global carbon footprint for the Galician fishing activity with previous calculations that did not include these emissions. Nevertheless, further efforts should be made in order to provide robust data in this respect. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"The formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled climate models developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are described. The models were designed to simulate atmospheric and oceanic climate and variability from the diurnal time scale through multicentury climate change, given our computational constraints. In particular, an important goal was to use the same model for both experimental seasonal to interannual forecasting and the study of multicentury global climate change, and this goal has been achieved. Two versions of the coupled model are described, called CM2.0 and CM2. The versions differ primarily in the dynamical core used in the atmospheric component, along with the cloud tuning and some details of the land and ocean components. For both coupled models, the resolution of the land and atmospheric components is 2 degrees latitude x 2.5 degrees longitude, the atmospheric model has 24 vertical levels. The ocean resolution is 1 degrees in latitude and longitude, with meridional resolution equatorward of 30 degrees becoming progressively finer, such that the meridional resolution is 1/3 degrees at the equator. There are 50 vertical levels in the ocean, with 22 evenly spaced levels within the top 220 m. The ocean component has poles over North America and Eurasia to avoid polar filtering. Neither coupled model employs flux adjustments. The control simulations have stable, realistic climates when integrated over multiple centuries. Both models have simulations of ENSO that are substantially improved relative to previous GFDL coupled models. The CM2.0 model has been further evaluated as an ENSO forecast model and has good skill (CM2.1 has not been evaluated as an ENSO forecast model). Generally reduced temperature and salinity biases exist in CM2.1 relative to CM2.0. These reductions are associated with 1) improved simulations of surface wind stress in CM2.1 and associated changes in oceanic gyre circulations; 2) changes in cloud tuning and the land model, both of which act to increase the net surface shortwave radiation in CM2.1, thereby reducing an overall cold bias present in CM2.0; and 3) a reduction of ocean lateral viscosity in the extratropics in CM2.1, which reduces sea ice biases in the North Atlantic. Both models have been used to conduct a suite of climate change simulations for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report and are able to simulate the main features of the observed warming of the twentieth century. The climate sensitivities of the CM2.0 and CM2. models are 2.9 and 3.4 K, respectively. These sensitivities are defined by coupling the atmospheric components of CM2.0 and CM2.1 to a slab ocean model and allowing the model to come into equilibrium with a doubling of atmospheric CO(2). The output from a suite of integrations conducted with these models is freely available online (see http://nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov/).",1
"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is emitted from wastewater treatment processes, and is known to be a green house gas contributing to global warming. It is thus important to develop technology that can suppress N2O emission. The effects of sludge retention time (SRT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) on N2O emission in an anoxic-oxic activated sludge system were estimated. Moreover, the microbial community structure in the sludge, which plays an important role in N2O Suppression, was clarified based on nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene analysis by molecular biological techniques. The results showed that under low SRT conditions, nitrification efficiency was reduced and the N2O emission rate in the oxic reactors was increased. It was also observed that N2O emission was enhanced under low DO conditions, where the available oxygen is insufficient for nitrification. Moreover, molecular analysis revealed that the clones identified in this study were closely related to Ralstonia eutropha and Paracoccus denitrificans. The fact that the identified sequences are not closely related to known culturable denitrifier nosZ sequences indicates a substantial in situ diversity of denitrifiers contributing to N2O suppression, which are not reflected in the cultivatable fraction of the population. The further application of these new molecular techniques should serve to enhance our knowledge of the microbial community of denitrifying bacteria contributing to N2O suppression in wastewater treatment systems.",1
"Greenhouse gas such as CO2 is the primary cause of global warming. Alternative energy source should be provided without producing more CO2, such as solar energy. One of the best routes to remedy CO2 is to transform it to hydrocarbons using photo reduction. In our study, CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol using a Hg lamp with wavelength 365 nm in a steady-state optical-fiber photo reactor. The optical-fiber photo reactor, comprised of near 120 Cu/TiO2-coated fibers, was designed and assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly inside reactor. TiO2 film was coated on optical fiber using dip-coating method. Titania and Cu-loaded solutions were prepared by a thermal hydrolysis method. The thickness of Cu/TiO2 film was 53 nm and consisted of very. ne spherical particle with diameter of near 14 nm. The XRD spectra indicated the anatase phase of all TiO2 and Cu/ TiO2 films. The wavelength of absorption edge was on 367 nm, equivalent to near 3.3 eV. Most active Cu species on TiO2 surface were Cu2O clusters, and played an important role for the formation of methanol. The methanol yield increased with UV irradiative intensity. Photo activity increased with increasing Cu loadings. Maximum methanol rate was 0.45 mu mole/g-cat center dot hr using 2 wt%- Cu/TiO2 catalyst under 16W/cm(2) irradiation, 3 bar pressure of CO2, and 5000 seconds mean residence time. Higher than 2 wt% Cu loading gave less rate of methanol yield because of the masking effect of Cu2O clusters on the surface of TiO2.",1
"Proposed in this paper is a new method for preserving the ice in the Arctic regions under the conditions of global warming. The main technique involves artificial polymer films, which are used as an additional cover for the overcooled northern regions. The polymer films are constructed in such a way that they cannot only reflect the incoming solar radiation but also provide additional sites for the nucleation of ice crystals. This feature of polymer films to produce ice crystal aggregation in the larger ice structures in the adjoining area can be achieved by decreasing sea wave amplitudes in the vicinity of the considered area.

"The focus on context-sensitive design in roadway planning, increased support for addressing public health objectives through transportation and land use planning, and concerns about oil dependence and global warming are growing. Combined, these factors have raised expectations for transportation engineering and planning practitioners to possess more knowledge and skills related to pedestrian and bicycle planning and design. This demand requires more education on these topics. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of 86 university faculty members about the inclusion of bicycle and pedestrian topics in their transportation courses. Of the 134 transportation courses taught by respondents, 59% included bicycle or pedestrian topics, or both. However, because of potential response bias, the findings might be an optimistic assessment of the coverage of bicycle and pedestrian topics in current curricula. Just over half (52%) of the civil engineering courses included only 1 to 2 h of class time on the topics, whereas all of the courses in planning programs offered at least 3 h on the topics. The topics covered most often were pedestrian safety, pedestrian and bicycle planning, and pedestrian and bicycle facility design. At least 43% of the faculty were interested in course materials on pedestrian and bicycle topics that they could incorporate into existing courses. PowerPoint and lecture materials were the most commonly requested types of materials.",1
"Methane (CH(4)) production in the rumen represents a loss of energy for the host animal; in addition, methane eructated by ruminants may contribute to a greenhouse effect or global warming. The dinumal CH(4) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from sheep were continuously recorded using the flow-through chamber method. A type new type of non-disperse infrared (NDIR) gas sensors based on pulse IR source was introduced, and by using the high performance pyroelectric IR sensor with built in interference filter and the ""single light and two wavelengths"" technology, CH(4) and CO(2) measurement from ruminants was achieved. Animals were given dry oat hay as the basic diet and supplemented concentrate with the ratio of 7:3. The results showed that the recovery was 96.7% and 96.2% for CH(4) and CO(2), respectively. Methane and carbon dioxide output from sheep respectively averaged 15.6 g per day and 184.7 g per day, equivalent to 6.8 and 71 kg per animal. Diurnal fluctuations in hourly rates of CH(4) and CO(2) production in hourly of methane increased during day light to reach a peak at or near sunset and then declined towards sunrise, and consideration was given to the dry matter intake of the animals used in these studies and its possible effects on CH(4) production.",1
"To assess their impacts on net global warming, total greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2, N2O and CH4) from agricultural production in arable land cropping systems in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, Japan, were estimated using life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis. The LCI data included CO2 emissions from on-farm and off-farm fossil fuel consumption, soil CO2 emissions induced by the decomposition of soil organic matter, direct and indirect N2O emissions from arable lands and CH4 uptake by soils, which were then aggregated in CO2-equivalents. Under plow-based conventional tillage (CT) cropping systems for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage, on-farm CO2 emissions from fuel-consuming operations such as tractor-based field operations, truck transportation and mechanical grain drying ranged from 0.424 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for adzuki bean to 0.826 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat. Off-farm CO2 emissions resulting from the use of agricultural materials such as chemical fertilizers, biocides (pesticides and herbicides) and agricultural machines were estimated by input-output tables to range from 0.800 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat to 724 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for sugar beet. Direct N2O emissions previously measured in an Andosol field of this region showed a positive correlation with N fertilizer application rates. These emissions, expressed in CO2-equivalents, ranged from 0.041 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for potato to 0.382 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for cabbage. Indirect N2O emissions resulting from N leaching and surface runoff were estimated to range from 0.069 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for adzuki bean to 0.381 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for cabbage. The rates of CH4 removal from the atmosphere by soil uptake were equivalent to only 0.020-0.042 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). From the difference in the total soil C pools (0-20 cm depth) between 1981 and 2001, annual CO2 emissions from the CT and reduced tillage (RT) soils were estimated to be 4.91 and 3.81 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. In total, CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions under CT cropping systems in the Tokachi region of Hokkaido amounted to 6.97, 7.62, 6.44, 6.64 and 7.49 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for winter wheat, sugar beet, adzuki bean, potato and cabbage production, respectively. Overall, soil-derived CO2 emissions accounted for a large proportion (64-76%) of the total greenhouse gas emissions. This illustrates that soil management practices that enhance C sequestration in soil may be an effective means to mitigate large greenhouse gas emissions from arable land cropping systems such as those in the Tokachi region of northern Japan. Under RT cropping systems, plowing after harvesting was omitted, and total greenhouse gas emissions from winter wheat, sugar beet and adzuki bean could be reduced by 18%, 4% and 18%, respectively, mainly as a result of a lower soil organic matter decomposition rate in the RT soil and a saving on the fuels used for plowing.",1
"A brief summary of the current capabilities of a high resolution global numerical prediction model towards resolving the life cycles of hurricanes is first presented. Next, we illustrate the results of season long integrations for the years 1987 and 1988 using the observed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the global oceans. The model being used here is the FSU atmospheric global spectral model at the horizontal resolution of T42 and with 16 vertical layers. The main emphasis of this study is on hurricane tracks for these and for global warming experiments. The global warming scenarios were modeled using doubled CO2 and enhanced SST anomalies. The model being atmospheric does not simulate the ocean, and SST anomalies need to be prescribed. It is assumed in these experiments that the SST anomalies of the doubled CO2 world appear similar to those of the current period but that they are slightly warmer over the global tropics. That is determined using a simple proportionality relationship requiring an enhancement of the global mean SST anomaly over the tropics. Such an enhancement of the SST anomaly of an El Nino year 1987 amplifies the SST anomaly for the El Nino of the double CO2 atmosphere somewhat. The La Nina SST anomalies were similarly enhanced for the double CO2 atmosphere during 1988. These hurricane season experiments cover the period June through October for the respective years. It was necessary to define the thresholds for a model simulated hurricane; given such a definition we have compared first the tracks and frequency of storms based on the present day CO2 simulations with the observed storms for 1987 and 1988. Those comparisons were noted to be very close to the observed numbers of the storms. The doubled CO2 storms show a significant enhancement of the frequency of storms for the La Nina periods, however there was no noticeable change for the El Nino experiments. We have also run an experiment using the SST anomalies from a triple CO2 climate run made at the Max Planck Institut at Hamburg, This experiment simulated some 7 hurricanes over the Atlantic Ocean. The intensity of hurricanes, inferred from maximum winds at 850 mb, show that on the average the storms are slightly more intense for the double CO2 experiments compared to the storms simulated from current CO2 conditions. The triple CO2 storms were slightly stronger in this entire series of experiments.",1
"A 10-yr record of the thermal characteristics of four lakes at the North-Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research site was analyzed and used to validate simulations of lake physics with the dynamic reservoir simulation model. Simulations of cool, warm, and intermediate years were rerun with meteorology from four general circulation models with a doubling of CO2. In all simulations with doubled CO2 there is an earlier onset of stratification, increased summer epilimnetic temperature ( 1-7 degrees C), and an increased intensity and longer duration of stratification. Maximum surface temperatures at times may exceed upper lethal limits of warm and cool water fish in some scenarios. Suitable thermal habitat for cold water, cool water, and warm water fish generally increases in all scenarios after climate change. Changes in the vertical migration of Daphnia, however, are expected to vary depending on the interaction of thermal stratification and fish habitat use. In northern Wisconsin lakes with cold water planktivores, habitat overlap between fish and zooplankton is expected to decrease, while in southern Wisconsin lakes habitat overlap is expected to increase. Although most physical responses of lakes to climate change are consistent among all climate scenarios, biological responses will likely be more variable owing to the complex nature of factors determining ecological interactions in lakes.",1
"The use of renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly necessary to mitigate global warming. Recently much research has been focused on identifying suitable biomass species, which can provide high-energy outputs, to replace conventional fossil fuels. This paper reports an approach for increasing the yield of bio-oil production from fast pyrolysis after manipulating the metabolic pathway in microalgae through heterotrophic growth. The yield of bio-oil (57.9%) produced from heterotrophic Chlorella protothecoides cells was 3.4 times higher than from autotrophic cells by fast pyrolysis. The bio-oil was characterized by a much lower oxygen content, with a higher heating value (41 MJ kg(-1)), a lower density (0.92 kg l(-1)), and lower viscosity (0.02 Pas) compared to those of bio-oil from autotrophic cells and wood. These properties are comparable to fossil oil. The research could contribute to the creation of a system to produce energy from microalgae, and also could have great commercial potential for liquid fuel production. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"The concept of comprehensiveness embedded in the climate convention is discussed with attention to political and scientific considerations that need to be taken into account for this approach to serve as a tool for enhancing the effectiveness of a climate regime. The manners in which the approach may serve as an instrument for facilitating negotiation and implementation of a climate regime are discussed, and an operational definition is suggested. A key question with regard to the employment of a comprehensive approach in climate politics concerns how well methodologies for comparing gases perform. This question is discussed with regard to Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). When the most important greenhouse gases are concerned, we suggest that in the absence of better alternatives, the use of GWPs may serve as a preliminary tool for policy making until better methods are developed. It is emphasized that the choice of time horizon has significant ecological and political implications that should be taken into account.",1
"A study of snow statistics over the past 50 years at several climatological stations in the Swiss Alps has highlighted periods in which snow was either abundant or not. Periods with relative low snow amounts and duration are closely linked to the presence of persistent high surface pressure fields over the Alpine region during late Fall and in Winter. These high pressure episodes are accompanied by large positive temperature anomalies and low precipitation, both of which are unfavorable for snow accumulation during the Winter. The fluctuations of seasonal to annual pressure in the Alpine region is strongly correlated with anomalies of the North Atlantic Oscillation index, which is a measure of the strength of the westerly Row over the Atlantic. This implies that large-scale forcing, and not local or regional factors, plays a dominant role in controling the timing and amount of snow in the Alps, as evidenced by the abundance or dearth of snow over several consecutive years. Furthermore, since the mid-1980s, the length of the snow season and snow amount have substantially decreased, as a result of pressure fields over the Alps which have been far higher and more persistent than at any other time this century. A detailed analysis of a number of additional Alpine stations for the last 15 years shows that the sensitivity of the snow-pack to climatic fluctuations diminishes above 1750 m. In the current debate on anthropogenically-induced climatic change, this altitude is consistent with other studies and estimates of snow-pack sensitivity to past and projected future global warming.",1
"Energy is indispensable for human life. Energy is not only a measurement for economical and social improvement but also a fundamental human necessity. Every country in the planet are trying to find a way to solve energy problems such as depending on energy importation, all kind of environmental pollution, global warming, increasing cost of energy, and energy inefficiency. Industrial and technologic developments are continuing rapidly, the need of energy consuming is increasing accordingly, and also concerning the population increase; the governments are given vast amount of incentives for renewable energy for the solutions to these kinds of problems and for the aims to be realized, which are saving money, saving energy and therefore saving the world. In this study, recent renewable energy developments, the evaluation of renewable energy, the importance of renewable energy use, the incentives and subsidies, the renewable energy policies in Turkey are investigated. In this regard some barriers and recommendations are submitted.",1
"It has been suggested that calculations of historical responsibility for global warming should be used to distribute mitigation requirements in future climate agreements. For a medium-term mitigation scenario, we calculate regional mitigation costs resulting from global allocation schemes based on the Brazilian Proposal that solely incorporate historical responsibility as a burden sharing criterion. We find that they are likely to violate ability-to-pay principles. In spite of less stringent abatement requirements, developing country regions experience cost burdens (as a percentage of GDP) in the same range as those of developed countries. We also assess the policy options available for calculating historical responsibility. The periodic updating of responsibility calculations over time, concerns over the robustness and availability of emissions data, and the question of whether past emissions were knowingly harmful, may lead to policy choices that increase the relative historical responsibility attributed to developing countries. This, in turn, would increase their mitigation cost burden. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Accumulating evidence points to an anthropogenic 'fingerprint' on the global climate change that has occurred in the last century. Climate change has, and will continue to have, profound effects on the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems. As such, there is a critical need to continue to develop a sound scientific basis for national and international policies regulating carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reflects on the nature of current global change experiments, and provides recommendations for a unified multidisciplinary approach to future research in this dynamic field. These recommendations include: (1) better integration between experiments and models, and amongst experimental, monitoring, and space-for-time studies; (2) stable and increased support for long-term studies and multi-factor experiments; (3) explicit inclusion of biodiversity, disturbance, and extreme events in experiments and models; (4) consideration of timing vs intensity of global change factors in experiments and models; (5) evaluation of potential thresholds or ecosystem 'tipping points'; and (6) increased support for model-model and model-experiment comparisons. These recommendations, which reflect discussions within the TERACC international network of global change scientists, will facilitate the unraveling of the complex direct and indirect effects of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and their components.

"The response of boreal forests to anthropogenic climate change remains uncertain, with potentially significant impacts for the global carbon cycle, albedo, canopy evapotranspiration and feedbacks into further climate change. Here, we focus on tree-ring data from the Firth River site at treeline in northeastern Alaska, in a tundra-forest transition region where pronounced warming has already occurred. Both tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies were developed to identify the nature of tree growth and density responses to climatic and environmental changes in white spruce (Picea glauca), a dominant Arctic treeline species. Good agreement was found between the interannual fluctuations in the TRW chronology and summer temperatures from 1901 to 1950, whereas no significant relationships were found from 1951 to 2001, supporting evidence of significant divergence between TRW and summer temperature in the second half of the 20th century. In contrast to this unstable climatic response in the TRW record, the high frequency July-August temperature signal in the MXD series seems reasonably stable through the 20th century. Wider and denser rings were more frequent during the 20th century, particularly after 1950, than in previous centuries. Finally, comparison between the tree-ring proxies and a satellite-derived vegetation index suggests that TRW and MXD correlate with vegetation productivity at the landscape level at different times of the growing season.",1
"An understanding of the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) as affected by farming practices is imperative for maintaining soil productivity and also for restraining global warming by CO(2) evolution. Results of a long-term (30 year) experiment in the Indian Himalayas under rainfed soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation was analyzed to determine the influence of mineral fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) application at 10 Mg ha(-1) on SOC and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks and distribution within different aggregate size fractions. Fertilizers (NP, NK and NPK) and FYM in combination with N or NPK were applied before the soybean crop every year and no nutrient was applied before the wheat crop. Results showed that addition of FYM with N or NPK fertilizers increased SOC and TSN contents. The overall gain in SOC in the 0- to 45-cm soil depth interval in the plots under NPK + FYM treatment over NPK was 17.18 Mg C ha(-1) in 30 year. The rate of conversion of input C to SOC was about 19% of each additional Mg C input per hectare. SOC content in large size aggregates was greater than in smaller size aggregates, and declined with decreased aggregate size. Thus, long-term soybean-wheat rotation in a sandy loam soil of the Indian Himalayas sequestered carbon and nitrogen. Soil organic C and TSN sequestration in the 0.25- to 0.1-mm size fraction is an ideal indicator of long-term C and N sequestration, since this fraction retained maximum SOC/TSN stock.",1
"Global climate change is one of the most important issues of contemporary environmental safety. A scientific consensus is forming that the emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, from anthropogenic activities may play a key role in elevating the global temperatures. Quantifying soil greenhouse gas emissions is an essential task for understanding the atmospheric impacts of anthropogenic activities in terrestrial ecosystems. In most soils, production or consumption of the three major greenhouse gases is regulated by interactions among soil redox potential, carbon source and electron acceptors. Two classical formulas, the Nernst equation and the Michaelis-Menten equation, describe the microorganism-mediated redox reactions from aspects of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, respectively. The two equations are functions of a series of environmental factors (e.g. temperature, moisture, pH, Eh) that are regulated by a few ecological drivers, such as climate, soil properties, vegetation and anthropogenic activity. Given the complexity of greenhouse gas production in soils, process-based models are required to interpret, integrate and predict the intricate relationships among the gas emissions, the environmental factors and the ecological drivers. This paper reviews the scientific basis underlying the modeling of greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial soils. A case study is reported to demonstrate how a biogeochernical model can be used to predict the impacts of alternative management practices on greenhouse gas emissions from rice paddies.",1
"Changes in the radiative atmospheric conditions due to anthropogenic pollution are simulated mathematically. This simulation is used to describe the effect of anthropogenic and natural trace gases on the climate system in the past, as well as to estimate the influence of pollution on the radiative conditions in the future. A new scheme for radiative forcing computations is proposed and compared with the conventional scheme. Radiative forcing and the radiative contribution to global warming are examined depending on observed and pre dieted emissions of basic trace gases. Various scenarios of anthropogenic pollutant emissions and individual gaseous pollutants are estimated as sources of influence on radiative forcing and global warming.",1
"Global warming is one of the most important problems of the present day. The increase of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and other greenhouse gases causes a great problem in the atmosphere. However, CO(2) gas constituted the biggest threat at present, though the other gases increase, too. One of the primary precautions to take for this is the context of soil earth atmospheric CO(2) through plants. Beside the context of soil carbon, some other factors are also affecting this context. Some of them are texture, bulk density (BD), cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations (EC), soil reaction (pH) and electrical conductivity (Ec). In Harran plain, an organic carbon amount ranged from 0.28 to 4.95 kg C m(-2). The statistic analyses data in the factors are: BD, organic carbon (OC), texture (clay, silt and sand%), CEC, EC, pH and Ec. The strongest correlation was found as BD and OC (R(2) = 99.96), but when compared with the other factors, it was detected as R(2) = 99.4. The reason for its height when we consider all the parameters is the involvement of organic carbon in the calculation. When we deal with them individually, the correlation falls below 50%. In this study, a point of high correlation is made between OC and BD. The study aims to determine, in the soils, BD, which is costly, hard and time consuming, and OC which is known by means of this correlation. In the comparison analysis of the entire data and the determination of the equations, student t test was used and the data were investigated at p<0.01 significance levels. However, ANOVA techniques were used regularly in this comparison.",1
"The quest for green car mobility faces two major challenges: air pollution from exhaust emissions and global climate change from greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicle air pollution emissions are being successfully tackled in many countries by technical solutions such as low-sulphur fuels, unleaded petrol and three-way catalytic converters. Many researchers advocate a similar approach for overcoming transport's climate change impacts. This study argues that finding a technical solution for this problem is not possible. Instead, the world will have to move to an alternative surface transport system involving far lower levels of motorised travel. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Nitrogen (N) fertilization can increase bioenergy crop production; however, fertilizer production and application can contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, potentially undermining the GHG benefits of bioenergy crops. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of N fertilization on GHG emissions and biomass production of switchgrass bioenergy crop, in northern Michigan. Nitrogen fertilization treatments included 0 kg ha(-1) (control), 56 kg ha(-1) (low) and 112 kg ha(-1) (high) of N applied as urea. Soil fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were measured every two weeks using static chambers. Indirect GHG emissions associated with field activities, manufacturing and transport of fertilizer and pesticides were derived from the literature. Switchgrass aboveground biomass yield was evaluated at the end of the growing season. Nitrogen fertilization contributed little to soil GHG emissions; relative to the control, there were additional global warming potential of 0.7 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) and 5 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) as CO2 equivalents (CO(2)eq), calculated using the IPCC values, in the low and high N fertilization treatments, respectively. However, N fertilization greatly stimulated CO2 uptake by switchgrass, resulting in 5- and 2.5-fold increases in biomass yield in the low and high N fertilization treatments, respectively. Nitrogen amendments improved the net GHG benefits by 2.6 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) and 9.4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) as CO(2)eq relative to the control. Results suggest that N fertilization of switchgrass in this region could reduce (15-50%) the land base needed for bioenergy production and decrease pressure on land for food and forage crop production.

"This paper analyses the structures of the energy and economic models represented in the recently completed Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) study, EMF 12: Economic Impacts of Policies to Reduce Energy-Sector Carbon Dioxide Emissions. The 14 models in the study are heterogeneous, which has a number of advantages. Chief among these is the greater number of insights obtainable by comparing the models' results in and across' global warming policy scenarios. To fully appreciate the results, however, it is necessary to understand how a model's structure affects its output. The disadvantage of a diverse set of models is that it complicates structure comparison, and thereby the interpretation of results. The relevant model characteristics fall into three broad areas of comparison. The first is the model type, including market representation. Despite the many differences among the models, five distinct classes of market representations are seen within which models have great similarity. This simplifies understanding the remaining areas of comparison: energy demand and supply modelling. The foci here are the representation of capital stock dynamics and market penetration of carbon free energy sources respectively.",1
"GLOBAL warming potentials for radiatively active trace gases (such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons) have generally been expressed1,2 relative to the time-integrated climate forcing per unit emission of carbon dioxide. Previous attempts to estimate the integrated climate forcing per unit CO2 emitted have focused on perturbations to steady-state conditions in carbon-cycle models. But for non-steady-state conditions, the integrated climate forcing from a CO2 perturbation depends both on the initial conditions and on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. As atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase, the radiative forcing per unit CO2 emitted will become smaller because the strongest absorption bands will already be saturated. At the same time, higher concentrations of dissolved carbon in the surface ocean will reduce the ocean's ability to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Each of these effects taken alone would affect the climate forcing from a pulse of emitted CO2 by a factor of three or more; but here we show that, taken together, they compensate for each other. The net result is that the global warming potential of CO2 relative to other radiatively active trace gases is nearly independent of the CO2 emission scenario. Thus, the concept of the global warming potential remains useful, despite the nonlinearities in the climate system and uncertainties in future emissions.",1
"Economic analyses of global warming have typically been grounded in the theory of economic efficiency. Such analyses may be inappropriate because many of the underlying concerns about climate change are rooted not in efficiency, but in the intergenerational allocation of economic endowments. A simple economic model is developed which demonstrates that an efficient economy is not necessarily a sustainable economy. This result leads directly to questions about the policy relevance of several economic studies of the issue. We then consider policy alternatives to address global warming in the context of economies with the dual objectives of efficiency and sustainability, with particular attention to carbon-based taxes.",1
"This paper proposes a global warming implementation regime which addresses the issues of equity, flexibility, cost minimization, and population growth. Previously proposed international policy instruments, such as country by country targets, carbon taxes, and tradable permits, face major difficulties as stand alone proposals. The key element of the regime proposed here is to combine annual tradable permits which are allocated based on population in a fixed year with a small carbon tax ($5-10/tonne) on emissions in excess of permits. Both permits and carbon taxes are applied to national level governments, which in turn would use whatever mix of policies desired to reduce national emissions. It is suggested that the initial number of permits correspond to total global emissions in the base year; over time, the number of permits could be reduced and the tax rate increased if improved scientific knowledge so dictates. By allocating permits based on population the equity concerns of developing countries are addressed, while taxing emissions in excess of permit holdings removes the rigidity of a quota system and limits resource transfers by effectively capping the permit trading price, which is a major concern of industrialized countries. To accommodate the difficulties of countries which have not yet achieved the demographic transition, the permit allocation scheme could be subject to a one-time adjustment after 10-15 years based on some weighting of the initial and then-current populations. The proposed scheme is based on the premise that there is a large potential for reducing emissions in developed countries or limiting emission increases in developing countries, and the intention is to create competition between national level governments in implementing cost-effective emission reduction.",1
"Carbon dioxide is the major greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Man-made CO2 emissions contribute approximately 63% of greenhouse gases and the cement industry is responsible for approximately 5% of CO2 emissions emitting nearly 900 kg of CO2 per 1000 kg of cement. CO2 from a cement plant was captured and purified to 98% using the monoethanolamine (MEA) based absorption process. The capture cost was $51 per tonne of CO2 captured, representing approximately 90% of total cost. Steam was the main operating cost representing 39% of the total capture cost. Switching from coal to natural gas reduces CO2 emissions by about 18%. At normal load, about 36 MW of waste heat is available for recovery to satisfy the parasitic heat requirements of MEA process; however, it is very difficult to recover.",1
"In the past 300 million years, there has been a near-perfect association between extinction events and the eruption of large igneous provinces, but proving the nature of the causal links is far from resolved. The associated environmental changes often include global warming and the development of widespread oxygen-poor conditions in the oceans. This implicates a role for volcanic CO2 emissions, but other perturbations of the global carbon cycle, such as release of methane from gas hydrate reservoirs or shut-down of photosynthesis in the oceans, are probably required to achieve severe green-house warming. The best links between extinction and eruption are seen in the interval from 300 to 150 Ma. With the exception of the Deccan Trap eruptions (65 Ma), the emplacement of younger volcanic provinces has been generally associated with significant environmental changes but little or no increase in extinction rates above background levels.",1
"Based on the practice of magnesium production in China, a quantitative evaluation of the environment impact was carried out according to the theory and framework of life cycle assessment(LCA) study. The major gaseous pollutants including CO(2), SO(2), NO(x), CH(4), HF and particulates were calculated. The accumulative environmental performances of different energy use strategies and the characterization results, including abiotic depletion potential(ADP), global warming potential(GWP), acidification potential(AP) and human-toxicity potential(HTP) were compared. The results show that the direct emission of fuel combustion in the process is the major contributor to the pollutants emission of magnesium production. Global warming potential and acidification potential make the main contribution to the accumulative environmental impact. The different fuel use strategies in the practice of magnesium production cause much different impacts on the environmental performance. The accumulative environmental impact of coal burned directly is the highest, and that of producer-gas comes to the next, while that of coke-oven gas is the lowest.",1
"Goal, Scope and Background. There is a competition between wet and thermal routes for phosphate fertilizers manufacture. In the Brazilian case, the thermal route is represented by thermophosphate. This fertilizer is considered the most adequate one for Brazilian agricultural conditions; its main restriction is the intensive consumption of energy necessary for its production. The wet route uses sulfuric acid to directly produce the single superphosphate (SSP) or the intermediate phosphoric acid, which will be used to result in triple superphosphate (TSP) and ammonium phosphate production. The main restriction of the wet route is the large amount of phosphogypsum generated in phosphoric acid production. Envisaged is an environmental comparison of both routes using LCA methodology. This paper presents the LCA for SSP production. The goal of the study is to establish the Environmental Profile of this fertilizer. Eight impact categories were selected for the study. The system boundaries was defined for a 'cradle to gate' approach, including extraction of natural resources, intermediate products, and production. The SSP System. The SSP system (single superphosphate) comprises the stages of mining and concentration of the phosphate rock, elemental sulfur extraction, production of sulfuric acid, and manufacture of single superphosphate. SSP LCI. The LCI was performed considering the production of 0 ton of SSP (single superphosphate) as a Functional Unit. The data collected were developed for different producing companies, all of them located in the same regional area. Allocation criteria of energy and mass were applied to the production of sulfuric acid and manufacture of single superphosphate. The transportation step included either the transport of the mined phosphated rock to the concentration plant or the transport of the phosphate concentrate to the SSP unit. Conclusion, Recommendation and Perspective. The accomplishment of an LCA to SSP production identified the GWP and EP as its meaningful environmental impacts. In reference to global warming, the transportation step was the greatest contributor agent, while the losses of PO4- from the SSP manufacturing were the main cause of ER The most important contribution in terms of water consumption was observed in the concentration step. Finally, the self sufficiency of the sulfuric acid production in energetic terms must be highlighted. The knowledge of the environmental profile of fertilizers is necessary to support LCA studies of agricultural products, a relevant raw material source for many industrial sectors. The method used here may be important for modelling other LCA fertilizer studies. As most of the agricultural raw materials are transferred among different countries, comparisons of the environmental profiles of fertilizers in developed and developing countries are needed.",1
"A coupled physical-biogeochemical climate model that includes a dynamic global vegetation model and a representation of a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model is driven by the nonintervention emission scenarios recently developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Atmospheric CO2, carbon sinks, radiative forcing by greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, changes in the fields of surface-air temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, ocean thermal expansion, and vegetation structure are projected. Up to 2100, atmospheric CO2 increases to 540 ppm for the lowest and to 960 ppm for the highest emission scenario analyzed. Sensitivity analyses suggest an uncertainty in these projections of -10 to +30% for a given emission scenario. Radiative forcing is estimated to increase between 3 and 8 W m(-2) between now and 2100. Simulated warmer conditions in North America and Eurasia affect ecosystem structure: boreal trees expand poleward in high latitudes and are partly replaced by temperate trees and grasses at lower latitudes. The consequences for terrestrial carbon storage depend on the assumed sensitivity of climate to radiative forcing, the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature, and the rate of increase in radiative forcing by both CO2 and other GHGs. In the most extreme cases, the terrestrial biosphere becomes a source of carbon during the second half of the century. High GHG emissions and high contributions of non-CO2 agents to radiative forcing favor a transient terrestrial carbon source by enhancing warning and the associated release of soil carbon.",1
"The aim of the present study was to decipher the diversity of methanogens in rumen of Murrah buffaloes so that effective strategies can be made in order to mitigate methane emission from these methanogens. In the present study diversity of rumen methanogens in Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) from North India was evaluated by using mcr-A gene library obtained from the pooled PCR product from four animals and by using MEGA4 software. A total of 104 clones were examined, revealing 26 different mcr-A gene sequences or phylotypes. Of the 26 phylotypes, 16 (64 of 104 clones) were less than 97% similar to any of the cultured strain of methanogens. Seven clone sequences were clustered with Methanomicrobium mobile and three clone sequences were clustered with Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii during the phylogenetic analysis. Uncultured group of methanogens comes out to he the major component of the methanogens community structure in Murrah buffaloes. Methanomicrobium phylotype conies out to be major phylotype among cultured methanogens followed by Methanobrevibacter phylotype. These results help in making effective strategies to check the growth of dominant methanogenic communities in the rumen of this animal which in turn help in the reduction of methane emission in the environment and ultimately helps us in fighting with the problem of global warming.",1
"A kerosene microwave plasma burner was presented as a tool for abatement of SF6 and CF4 gases, which cause global warming. The plasma burner operates by injecting kerosene as a liquid hydrocarbon fuel into a microwave plasma torch and by mixing the resultant gaseous hydrogen and carbon compounds with air or oxygen (O-2) gas. The abatement of SF6 and CF4, by making use of the kerosene plasma burner, was conducted in terms of nitrogen (N-2) flow rates. The destruction and removal efficiency of the burner were achieved up to 99.9999% for 0.1 liters per minute (lpm) SF6 in 120 lpm N-2 and 99.3% for 0.05 lpm CF4 in 60 lpm N-2, revealing that the microwave plasma burner can effectively eliminate perfluorocompounds emitted from the semiconductor industries.

"Iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean is believed to counter the increasing CO(2) concentration in the atmosphere and the consequent global warming. Though a number of large scale iron enrichment experiments have been done in the recent past in different parts of the world ocean, little effort has been made to understand the effect of iron enrichment on nitrogen uptake rates and f-ratios. Here we assess the effect of iron addition on N-uptake rates and f-ratio in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. This study shows, in contrast to the earlier belief, that iron addition enhances not only nitrate uptake (similar to 3x) but it causes a significant increase in ammonium (similar to 2x) and urea (similar to 3x) uptakes as well. Also, since iron enrichment caused significant increase in the uptake of all N-substrates, its effect on f-ratio was insignificant.",1
"In recent years there has been a steadily increasing focus on energy efficiency as a means to reduce the negative impact of human activity on climate, and in particular the effect that industrial emissions have on changes in the climate, specifically global warming. As far as power generation is concerned, emissions can be limited by maximizing energy efficiency while ensuring high levels of plant reliability. This paper reports on materials development work involving coated heat exchange alloys and the effect of welding of the coated alloys, simulating fabrication, on subsequent corrosion performance under laboratory conditions. Samples of the common boiler steels P91 (9% Cr) and HCM12A (12% Cr) were treated by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) in a pack cementation process to produce Al-rich coatings up to 100 mu m thick. The samples were machined to give bevelled edges for welding. Welding was carried out using commonly available alloy 625 fillet metal. It was found that sound weldments could readily be produced provided that care was taken to limit the heat input during the welding process. Excessive heat input could lead to cracking, but more importantly to dilution of Al in the coating adjacent to the weldment and in segregation of elements (Mo and Nb) in the weldment itself, Both dilution and segregation effects led to decreased corrosion resistance.",1
"Pollution imply the contamination of air, water and soil will: various chemicals, dust and smoke and is the result of any change of environment, which determines a natural ecological imbalance. Pollutants formed after industrial activities. Industry burning fossil fuels releasing into the atmosphere the greenhouse gases that warm the Earth, carbon dioxide in excess favors retaining heat from the earth surface, thereby preventing its reflection in the atmospheric layers. Is thus the greenhouse effect which leads to raising the average temperature of earth atmosphere, melting polar glaciers, floods, etc. Because the chemicals disposed in the atmosphere, especially Freon in certain places on earth, the ozone layer decreased or even disappeared. This in turn leads to climate change, the increase the weather extremes, more droughts, heat, catastrophic fires and floods. Another serious consequence of pollution is acid rain generated by the transformation of sulfur oxides and nitrogen in the atmosphere, in sulfuric acid and nitric respectively. Acid rain burns the plants tissues which become yellow and die. Whole forests have disappeared in this case. If the air pollution-symbol image is provided by trees ""perforated"" by acid rain, water pollution expression feature could be considered ""black tide"" that is virtually pollution continue, the big oil and the world oceans, with disastrous effects on flora and marine fauna. Lack of strong and urgent measures to reduce and even eliminate pollution can result in a time not too remote, the catastrophic and irreparable mutations on the ecosystem. Environmental protection is not just an individual problem, but requires a collective and mutual help!",1
"Earlier GCM studies have expressed the concern that an enhancement of greenhouse warming might increase the occurrence of summer droughts in mid-latitudes, especially in southern Europe and central North America. This could represent a severe threat for agriculture in the regions concerned, where summer is the main growing season. These predictions must however be considered as uncertain, since most studies featuring enhanced summer dryness in mid-latitudes use very simple representations of the land-surface processes (""bucket"" models), despite their key importance for the issue considered. The current study uses a regional climate model including a land-surface scheme of intermediate complexity to investigate the sensitivity of the summer climate to enhanced greenhouse warming over the American Midwest. A surrogate climate change scenario is used for the simulation of a warmer climate. The control runs are driven at the lateral boundaries and the sea surface by reanalysis data and observations, respectively. The warmer climate experiments are forced by a modified set of initial and lateral boundary conditions. The modifications consist of a uniform 3 K temperature increase and an attendant increase of specific humidity (unchanged relative humidity). This strategy maintains a similar dynamical forcing in the warmer climate experiments, thus allowing to investigate thermodynamical impacts of climate change in comparative isolation. The atmospheric CO2 concentration of the sensitivity experiments is set to four times its pre-industrial value. The simulations are conducted from March 15 to October 1st, for 4 years corresponding to drought (1988), normal (1986, 1990) and flood (1993) conditions. The numerical experiments do not present any great enhancement of summer drying under warmer climatic conditions. First, the overall changes in the hydrological cycle (especially evapotranspiration) are of small magnitude despite the strong forcing applied. Second, precipitation increases in spring lead to higher soil water recharge during this season, compensating for the enhanced soil moisture depletion occurring later in the year. Additional simulations replacing the plant control on transpiration with a bucket-type formulation presented increased soil drying in 1988, the drought year. This suggests that vegetation control on transpiration might play an important part in counteracting an enhancement of summer drying when soil water gets limited. Though further aspects of this issue would need investigating, our results underline the importance of land-surface processes in climate integrations and suggest that the risk of enhanced summer dryness in the region studied might be less acute than previously assumed, provided the North American general circulation does not change markedly with global warming.",1
"Two forest management objectives being debated in the context of federally managed landscapes in the U. S. Pacific Northwest involve a perceived trade-off between. re restoration and carbon sequestration. The former strategy would reduce fuel ( and therefore C) that has accumulated through a century of. re suppression and exclusion which has led to extreme. re risk in some areas. The latter strategy would manage forests for enhanced C sequestration as a method of reducing atmospheric CO(2) and associated threats from global climate change. We explored the trade-off between these two strategies by employing a forest ecosystem simulation model, STANDCARB, to examine the effects of fuel reduction on. re severity and the resulting long-term C dynamics among three Pacific Northwest ecosystems: the east Cascades ponderosa pine forests, the west Cascades western hemlock-Douglas-fir forests, and the Coast Range western hemlock-Sitka spruce forests. Our simulations indicate that fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems consistently reduced. re severity. However, reducing the fraction by which C is lost in a wild. re requires the removal of a much greater amount of C, since most of the C stored in forest biomass ( stem wood, branches, coarse woody debris) remains unconsumed even by high-severity wild. res. For this reason, all of the fuel reduction treatments simulated for the west Cascades and Coast Range ecosystems as well as most of the treatments simulated for the east Cascades resulted in a reduced mean stand C storage. One suggested method of compensating for such losses in C storage is to utilize C harvested in fuel reduction treatments as biofuels. Our analysis indicates that this will not be an effective strategy in the west Cascades and Coast Range over the next 100 years. We suggest that forest management plans aimed solely at ameliorating increases in atmospheric CO2 should forgo fuel reduction treatments in these ecosystems, with the possible exception of some east Cascades ponderosa pine stands with uncharacteristic levels of understory fuel accumulation. Balancing a demand for maximal landscape C storage with the demand for reduced wild. re severity will likely require treatments to be applied strategically throughout the landscape rather than indiscriminately treating all stands.",1
"Urban shade trees offer significant benefits in reducing building air-conditioning demand and improving urban air quality by reducing smog. The savings associated with these benefits vary by climate region and can be up to $200 per tree. The cost of planting trees and maintaining them can vary from $10 to $500 per tree. Tree-planting programs can be designed to have lower costs so that they offer potential savings to communities that plant trees. Our calculations suggest that urban trees play a major role in sequestering CO, and thereby delay global warming. We estimate that a tree planted in Los Angeles avoids the combustion of 18 kg of carbon annually, even though it sequesters only 4.5-11 kg (as it would if growing in a forest). In this sense, one shade tree in Los Angeles is equivalent to three to five forest trees. In a recent analysis for Baton Rouge, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City, we estimated that planting an average of four shade trees per house (each with a top view cross section of 50 m(2)) would lead to an annual reduction in carbon emissions from power plants of 16,000, 41,000, and 9000 t, respectively (the per-tree reduction in carbon emissions is about 10-11 kg per year). These reductions only account for the direct reduction in the net cooling- and heating-energy use of buildings. Once the impact of the community cooling is included, these savings are increased by at least 25%. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"One of the roles of the United Nations is to serve as a global conscience' and it has been inviting its Member States to give priority to addressing topics of global concern. One of the most debated and therefore best known initiatives is the 'Kyoto Agreement'. dealing with the prevention of further man-induced global warming. Another similar UN initiative in recent years is designed to address the problems of the World's largest cities, or 'MegaCities'. through a programme known as 'Habitat 21'. It is against this background that those involved in the ESA Technology Transfer Programme have been looking at how the Agency might be able to contribute to such initiatives by proposing space-derived and space-based technologies that can help to provide solutions. ESA's sponsorship of the publication in 2001 of the 'Megacities' book containing spectacular satellite remote-sensing imagery of the World's largest cities was seen as a first step in this direction. Designing the large conurbations of the future, as wen as the individual buildings that will make them up, already presents a formidable challenge, and one where the latest space technologies can help to improve the daily fives of those who will live there. Within the ESA Technology Transfer Programme, therefore, we have also begun to examine the potential contribution that space technologies can make to the building sector. The target is to be able to propose a very different style of housing surpassing current 'eco-designs' as wen as offering greater protection against, natural disasters and environmental threats.",1
"Rice agriculture is not only affected by climate change, but also contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere. In 1989, a major research project was initiated at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines to investigate relationships between climate change and rice production. A second project started in 1993 to investigate, in more detail, mitigation options that could be employed to help reduce CH(4) emissions from rice cultivation. An important component of all of this work was the quantification of these interactions between climate change and rice production into simulation models, and their subsequent use to upscale field measurements to national and regional levels. The first project developed such a model to integrate existing knowledge of effects of increased levels of CO(2) and temperature on rice growth, and used this to predict the impact of various climate change scenarios on rice production in SE Asia. In the second project, routines describing the dynamics of CH(4) production and emission from the soil were linked to a crop simulation model to estimate the effect of different crop management scenarios on national CH(4) emissions from various countries in the region. With the recent completion of the second project, it is timely to review this modelling work describing the relationships between the global environment and rice production, a task which we attempt in the present paper. The advantages and disadvantages of the modelling approaches used and other issues relating to the upscaling of field measurements to national and regional levels are discussed. Future research directions in this area are also identified. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Global warming and the consequent climatic changes that will come as a result of the increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere have increased the world's concern regarding reduction of these emissions. mainly in developed countries that pollute the most. Electricity generation in thermal power plants, as well as other industrial activities, such as chemical and petrochemical ones, entail the emission of pollutants that are harmful to humans, animals and plants. The emissions of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are directly related to the greenhouse effect. The negative effects of sulfur oxides (SO2 and SO3 named SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are their contribution to the formation of acid rain and their impacts on human health and on the biota in general. This study intends to evaluate the environmental impacts of the atmospheric pollution resulting from the burning of fossil fuels. This study considers the emissions of CO2, SOx, NOx and PM in an integral way, and they are compared to the international air quality standards that are in force using a parameter called ecological efficiency (epsilon).

"In the companion paper (Part I), we presented a model of permafrost carbon cycle to study the sensitivity of frozen carbon stocks to future climate warming. The mobilization of deep carbon stock of the frozen Pleistocene soil in the case of rapid stepwise increase of atmospheric temperature was considered. In this work, we adapted the model to be used also for floodplain tundra sites and to account for the processes in the soil active layer. The new processes taken into account are litter input and decomposition, plant-mediated transport of methane, and leaching of exudates from plant roots. The SRES-A2 transient climate warming scenario of the IPSL CM4 climate model is used to study the carbon fluxes from the carbon-rich Pleistocene soil with seasonal active-layer carbon cycling on top of it. For a point to the southwest from the western branch of Yedoma Ice Complex, where the climate warming is strong enough to trigger self-sustainable decomposition processes, about 256 kgC m(-2), or 70% of the initial soil carbon stock under present-day climate conditions, are emitted to the atmosphere in about 120 yr, including 20 kgC m(-2) released as methane. The total average flux of CO2 and methane emissions to the atmosphere during this time is of 2.1 kgC m(-2) yr(-1). Within the Yedoma, whose most part of the territory remains relatively cold, the emissions are much smaller: 0.2 kgC m(-2) yr(-1) between 2050 and 2100 for Yakutsk area. In a test case with saturated upper-soil meter, when the runoff is insufficient to evacuate the meltwater, 0.05 kgCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) on average are emitted as methane during 250 yr starting from 2050. The latter can translate to the upper bound of 1 GtC yr(-1) in CO2 equivalent from the 1 million km(2) area of the Yedoma.",1
"Assessments of global warming mitigation technologies are important for achieving the Kyoto target and planning post-Kyoto regimes. Regional differences in energy resources, growth in energy consumption, current technology diffusions, etc., should be considered in the assessments. A global energy systems model, DNE21+, with high regional resolution had treated the energy supply sectors in a bottom-up fashion and the end-use sectors in a top-down fashion, which was expressed by using long-term price elasticity. However, the assessments of technological options in the end-use sectors are currently more important, particularly for the near and middle terms. In order to evaluate the technological options not only in the energy supply sectors but also in the end-use sectors for energy savings and CO2 emission reductions, DNE21+ has been modified for treating two energy-intensive end-use sectors, i.e. steel and cement sectors, in the bottom-up fashion. The results reveal that the cost-effective global CO2 emission reductions in 2030 for stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 concentration at 550 ppmv in comparison with that in the reference case would be approximately 68 MtC/yr and almost zero in the steel and cement sectors, respectively. The cost-effective options include next-generation coke ovens and coke dry quenching (CDQ) in the steel sector. (c) 2007 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

"In the next century the world will face the need for new energy sources. Nuclear fusion can be one of the most attractive sources of energy from the viewpoint of safety and minimal environmental impact. Fusion will not produce CO(2) or SO(2) and thus will not contribute to global warming or acid rain. Achieving acceptable performance for a fusion power system in the areas of economics, safety and environmental acceptability, is critically dependent on performance of the blanket and diverter systems which are the primary heat recovery, plasma purification, and tritium breeding systems. Tritium self-sufficiency must be maintained for a commercial power plant. The hybrid reactor is a combination of the fusion and fission processes. For self-sustaining (D-T) fusion driver tritium breeding ratio should be greater than 05. So working out the systematics of (n, t) reaction cross-sections are of great importance for the definition of the excitation function character for the given reaction taking place on various nuclei at energies up to 20 MeV. In this study, we have calculated non-elastic cross-sections by using optical model for (n, t) reactions at 14-15 MeV energy. We have investigated the excitation function character and reaction Q-values depending on the asymmetry term effect for the (n, t) reaction cross-sections. We have obtained new coefficients for the (n, t) reaction cross-sections. We have suggested semi-empirical formulas including optical model nonelastic effects by fitting two parameters for the (n, t) reaction cross-sections at 14-15 MeV. We have discussed the odd-even effect and the pairing effect considering binding energy systematic of the nuclear shell model for the new experimental data and new cross-sections formulas (n, t) reactions developed by Tel et al. We have determined a different parameter groups by the classification of nuclei into even-even, even-odd and odd-even for (n, t) reactions cross-sections. The obtained cross-section formulas with new coefficients have been discussed and compared with the available experimental data.",1
" Changes in the Earth's climate caused by global warming are a looming problem that poses serious challenges not only for our generation but for future generations. An accurate determination of CO2 gas plays a critical role in this field of research. The measurement of greenhouse gases is pivotal to understanding the changes in Earth's climate and needs to be carried out with a high degree of accuracy. Precision measurements on a 0.1 mu mol/mol scale may provide research data for precisely monitoring the continuing changes that the planet is undergoing. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has recommended that carbon dioxide concentrations in air can be measured by comparing these with national reference gases using a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer to standardize international data. The CO2 molecules absorb the distinctive resonant frequencies in IR spectrometers. The NDIR analyzers usually use narrow band path filter to determine (CO2)-C-12 in all carbon dioxide molecules, which can possibly ignore the measurement of (CO2)-C-13 partially or totally. However, if the carbon isotopic abundances of CO2 samples deviate from those in standard CO2 gas, the NDIR measurement will not be exact. For accurate measurements, producers of reference gas mixtures either must use gas with natural isotopic abundances, or report the isotopic abundances of CO2. In order to document shifts based on isotopic variability, we prepared artificial air as CO2 reference gas mixtures gravimetrically with CO2 having different carbon isotopic signatures to study the resulting isotopic variations. We used different delta C-13 values of two CO2 source gases, A and B, corresponding to - 497 parts per thousand and - 14.88 parts per thousand, respectively, which were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. One set of reference gas mixtures (A1 to A5) was prepared from the CO2 source of delta C-13 = - 497 parts per thousand, and the other set of reference gas mixtures (B1, B2) was prepared from that of delta C-13 = - 14.88 parts per thousand. The CO2 abundances of the two sets of mixtures were compared by using NDIR. The reproducibility test for the set A showed that the data are consistent within uncertainty ( calibration line was obtained by the best secondary polynomial least squares fit). The uncertainty of CO2 concentration in the reference gas mixtures are 0.06 mu mol/mol with a 95% confidence level. The reproducibility of the NDIR measurement is 0.012 mu mol/mol ( standard deviation). The difference between the set A ( A1 to A5) and set B ( B1, B2) was found to be 0.17 +/- 0.01 mu mol/mol, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted value of 0.17 mu mol/mol.",1
"This study examines the changes in Cascade Mountain spring snowpack since 1930. Three new time series facilitate this analysis: a water-balance estimate of Cascade snowpack from 1930 to 2007 that extends the observational record 20 years earlier than standard snowpack measurements; a radiosonde-based time series of lower-tropospheric temperature during onshore flow, to which Cascade snowpack is well correlated; and a new index of the North Pacific sea level pressure pattern that encapsulates modes of variability to which Cascade spring snowpack is particularly sensitive. Cascade spring snowpack declined 23% during 1930-2007. This loss is nearly statistically significant at the 5% level. The snowpack increased 19% during the recent period of most rapid global warming (1976-2007), though this change is not statistically significant because of large annual variability. From 1950 to 1997, a large and statistically significant decline of 48% occurred. However, 80% of this decline is connected to changes in the circulation patterns over the North Pacific Ocean that vary naturally on annual to interdecadal time scales. The residual time series of Cascade snowpack after Pacific variability is removed displays a relatively steady loss rate of 2.0% decade (1), yielding a loss of 16% from 1930 to 2007. This loss is very nearly statistically significant and includes the possible impacts of anthropogenic global warming. The dates of maximum snowpack and 90% melt out have shifted 5 days earlier since 1930. Both shifts are statistically insignificant. A new estimate of the sensitivity of Cascade spring snowpack to temperature of -11% per degrees C, when combined with climate model projections of 850-hPa temperatures offshore of the Pacific Northwest, yields a projected 9% loss of Cascade spring snowpack due to anthropogenic global warming between 1985 and 2025.",1
"Many subtropical regions are expected to become drier due to climate change. This will lead to reduced vegetation which may in turn amplify the initial drying. Using a coupled atmosphere-ocean-land model with a dynamic vegetation component that predicts surface albedo change, here we simulate the climate change from 1901 to 2099 with CO2 and other forcings. In a standard IPCC-style simulation, the model simulated an increase in the world's 'warm desert' area of 2.5 million km(2) or 10% at the end of the 21st century. In a more realistic simulation where the vegetation-albedo feedback was allowed to interact, the 'warm desert' area expands by 8.5 million km 2 or 34%. This occurs mostly as an expansion of the world's major subtropical deserts such as the Sahara, the Kalahari, the Gobi, and the Great Sandy Desert. It is suggested that vegetation-albedo feedback should be fully included in IPCC future climate projections. Citation: Zeng, N., and J.

"The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed regulations  to control air emissions from municipal solid waste landfills. If these regulations are adopted, they would require waste methane mitigation in order to prevent emission into the atmosphere and reduce the effect on global warming. One potential use of the waste methane is in a device which produces energy, the fuel cell. This device would reduce air emissions affecting global warming, acid rain, and other health and environmental issues. By producing useable energy, it would also reduce our dependency on foreign oil. This paper discusses the US EPA program underway at International Fuel Cells Corporation to demonstrate landfill methane control, and the fuel cell energy recovery concept. In this program, two critical issues needed to be addressed: (i) a landfill gas cleanup method that would remove contaminants from the gas sufficient for fuel cell operation, and (ii) successful operation of a commercial fuel cell power plant on that lower-heating value waste methane gas.",1
"Global warming is a focus of political interest and life-cycle assessment of waste management systems reveals that energy recovery from municipal solid waste is a key issue. This paper demonstrates how the greenhouse gas effects of waste treatment processes can be described in a simplified manner by considering energy efficiency indicators. For evaluation to be consistent, it is necessary to use reasonable system boundaries and to take the generation of electricity and the use of heat into account. The new European R1 efficiency criterion will lead to the development and implementation of optimized processes/systems with increased energy efficiency which, in turn, will exert an influence on the greenhouse gas effects of waste management in Europe. Promising technologies are: the increase of steam parameters, reduction of in-plant energy consumption, and the combined use of heat and power. Plants in Brescia and Amsterdam are current examples of good performance with highly efficient electricity generation. Other examples of particularly high heat recovery rates are the energy-from-waste (EfW) plants in Malmo and Gothenburg. To achieve the full potential of greenhouse gas reduction in waste management, it is necessary to avoid landfilling combustible wastes, for example, by means of landfill taxes and by putting incentives in place for increasing the efficiency of EfW systems.",1
"Top gas recycling has been suggested as a method for reducing blast furnace fuel rates and thus reducing carbon emissions from the ironmaking process. Three methods of top gas recycling are numerically investigated using a mathematical model to predict the furnace performance at fixed blast volume and constant coke, ore and pulverised coal compositions with varying recycle volumes. For each recycling method, a first calculation sequence is performed varying recycle volume at fixed ore:fuel ratio, and also a second sequence at fixed average liquid metal outflow temperature. Simple replacement of normal blast gases with recycled top gas is predicted to cause the production rate to decrease and the fuel rate to increase. Likewise, oxygen enriched blast replacement has similar effects, although the severity is less as the blast oxygen rate is maintained in this case. Both of these methods reduce furnace efficiency. Hot reducing gas (HRG) replacement, where CO2 is stripped from the recycled gas, leads to an increase in production of up to 25% with a simultaneous decrease in fuel rate of 20% at fixed metal temperature, These calculations show that top gas recycling could be used to increasing furnace efficiency while decreasing carbon emissions thus making a positive contribution to efforts to prevent global warming.",1
"The main emphasis of this study is to evaluate the potential environmental impact of diecasting process, which is one of well organized and kind of green technologies in casting processes. Material life cycle assessment (MLCA) was carried out in actual diecasting factory that produces various lightweight aluminum and magnesium components to obtain life cycle inventory data, quantify environmental impacts and finally try to get solutions for environmental improvement. In diecasting process, most of environmental impacts come from melting of raw materials for abiotic resource depletion and global warming due to burning gas and electricity used. The problem of photochemical oxidant creation is induced by spraying and lubricating steps.",1
"This paper focuses on the role of accumulation and cloudiness changes in the response of the Greenland ice sheet to global warming. Changes in accumulation or cloudiness were often neglected, or coupled to temperature changes. We used model output on temperature, precipitation and cloudiness from a GCM (ECHAM4 T106). The GCM output was used to drive the Greenland model that exists of a vertically averaged ice now model, coupled to a 1D surface energy balance model that calculates the ablation. Variables are temperature, accumulation and cloudiness. Sensitivity experiments with this model show that changes in accumulation are very important for the ice sheet mass balance, whereas cloudiness is of secondary importance. If the Greenland model is forced by the GCM output, the Greenland model is found to contribute 70% less to sea level rise after 70 years than is indicated by the results presented in the IPCC report. This large discrepancy is mainly due to the fact that the enhanced ablation is strongly compensated by increased accumulation. Comparing the result obtained here with changes in mass balance derived directly from the same general circulation model, indicates a 20% larger contribution to sea level. This increase is due to changes in ice now, and a different method for the ablation calculation.",1
"Global warming and accompanying climate change may be caused by an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gasses generated by anthropogenic activities. In order to supply such a mechanism of global warming with a quantitative underpinning, we need to understand the multifaceted roles of the Earth's energy balance and material cycles. In this study, we propose a new one-dimensional simple Earth system model. The model consists of carbon and energy balance submodels with a north-south zonal structure. The two submodels are coupled by interactive feedback processes such as CO(2) fertilization of net primary production (NPP) and temperature dependencies of NPP, soil respiration, and ocean surface chemistry. The most important characteristics of the model are not only that the model requires a relatively short calculation time for carbon and energy simulation compared with a General Circulation Model (GCM) and an Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC), but also that the model can simulate average latitudinal variations. In order to analyze the response of the Earth system due to increasing greenhouse gasses, several simulations were conducted in one dimension from the years 1750 to 2000. Evaluating terrestrial and oceanic carbon uptake output of the model in the meridional direction through comparison with observations and satellite data, we analyzed the time variation patterns of air temperature in low- and middle-latitude belts. The model successfully reproduced the temporal variation in each latitude belt and the latitudinal distribution pattern of carbon uptake. Therefore, this model could more accurately demonstrate a difference in the latitudinal response of air temperature than existing models. As a result of the model evaluations, we concluded that this new one-dimensional simple Earth system model is a good tool for conducting global warming simulations. From future projections using various emission scenarios, we showed that the spatial distribution of terrestrial carbon uptake may vary greatly, not only among models used for climate change simulations, but also amongst emission scenarios.",1
"For almost 30 years. serious interest has been directed toward natural gas hydrate, a crystalline solid composed of water and methane, as a potential (i) energy resource, (ii) factor in global climate change, and (iii) submarine geohazard, Although each of these issues can affect human welfare, only (iii) is considered to be of immediate importance. Assessments of gas hydrate as an energy resource have often been overly optimistic, based in part on its very high methane content and on its worldwide occurrence in continental margins. Although these attributes are attractive, geologic settings, reservoir properties, and phase-equilibria considerations diminish the energy resource potential of natural gas hydrate. The possible role of gas hydrate in global climate change has been often overstated. Although methane is a ""greenhouse"" gas in the atmosphere, much methane from dissociated gas hydrate may never reach the atmosphere, but rather may be converted to carbon dioxide and sequestered by the hydrosphere/biosphere before reaching the atmosphere. Thus, methane from gas hydrate may have little opportunity to affect global climate change. However, submarine geohazards (such as sediment instabilities and slope failures on local and regional scales, leading to debris flows, slumps, slides, and possible tsunamis) caused by gas-hydrate dissociation are of immediate and increasing importance as humankind moves to exploit seabed resources in ever-deepening waters of coastal oceans. The vulnerability of gas hydrate to temperature and sea level changes enhances the instability of deep-water oceanic sediments, and thus human activities and installations in this setting can be affected.",1
"Decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical component of the global carbon cycle, and accurate estimates of SOC decomposition are important for forest carbon modeling and ultimately for decision making relative to carbon sequestration and mitigation of global climate change. We determined the major pools of SOC in four sites representing major forest types in China: temperate forests at Changbai Mountain (CBM) and Qilian Mountain (QLM), and sub-tropical forests at Yujiang (YJ) and Liping (LP) counties. A 90-day laboratory incubation was conducted to measure CO2 evolution from forest soils from each site, and data from the incubation study were fitted to a three-pool first-order model that separated mineralizable soil organic carbon into active (C-a), slow (C-s) and resistant (C-r) carbon pools. Results indicate that: (1) the rate of SOC decomposition in the sub-tropical zone was faster than that in the temperature zone, (2) The C-a pool comprised similar to 1-3 % of SOC with an average mean residence time (MRT) of 219 days. The C-s pool comprised similar to 25-65% with an average MRT of 78 yr. The C-r pool accounted for similar to 35-80% of SOC, (3) The YJ site in the sub-tropical zone had the greatest C-a pool and the lowest MRT, while the QLM in the temperature zone had the greatest MRT for both the C-a and C-s pools. The results suggest a higher capacity for long-term C sequestration as SOC in temperature forests than in subtropical forests. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"In the field of municipal solid waste disposal, the direct melting process of the coke-bed type shaft furnace is effective in prolonging the useful life of the final disposal sites and reducing harmful matter such as dioxins. However, recently, it has become necessary to reduce coke consumption for the direct inching process in order to prevent global warming and reduce maintenance costs. Accordingly, the authors have developed technology for injecting various combustibles through the tuyeres of the direct inciting furnace. In particular, combustible dust in the pyrolysis gas dischanged from the furnace top was focused to reduce coke consumption. In this study, some experiments oil combustible dust injection through the tuyeres were carried out by using an experimental plant and a commercial facility. The main results obtained are as follows: (1) Combustible dust injected through the lower tuyeres is consumed by combustion and melting in the furnace. This technology is effective in reducing coke consumption and fly ash. (2) Combustible dust injection through the tuyeres maintains low Pb concentration in the slag even under the condition of low coke ratio. Moreover, combustibility in the combustion chamber is improved, and the generation of dioxins is suppressed.",1
"Desert/remote Australia is blessed with abundant natural energy resources from solar, geothermal and other renewable sources. If these were harnessed and connected appropriately desert/remote Australia could be not only energy self-sufficient but a net exporter. Generation of abundant, clean energy can also attract energy-intensive industries and provide local income and employment. Such co-benefits should be included in any cost-benefit analysis. Regardless of renewable energy's contribution to reducing climate change, the world is already committed to global warming and associated climate changes. Desert/remote Australia will thus inevitably get warmer, with implications for health, energy demand and other issues, and may be subject to increased extremes such as flooding, longer dry spells, more severe storms and coastal inundation. In addition, the prospect of world demand for oil from conventional sources exceeding supply will likely lead to oil shortages, higher oil prices, and additional incentives to provide alternative energy supplies. The region is heavily reliant on diesel generators and fossil fuel-powered motor vehicles and airplanes for transport for within-region mobility, the importation of goods, the tourism industry and emergency medical services. Without adaptation, climate change and peak oil will make living in desert/remote Australia less attractive, resulting in increased difficulty of attracting and retaining skilled workers, which would constrain development. This paper focuses on the climate and energy-related impacts and potential responses. These are both a challenge and an opportunity. They could provide additional employment and income, thus helping remote communities to participate in the clean energy economy of the future and thus overcome some serious social problems. The paper attempts to review current knowledge and provoke debate on relevant investment strategies, and it teases out the questions in need of further research.",1
"Atmospheric CO(2) is a major cause of reinforcement corrosion in bridges, buildings, wharves, and other concrete infrastructure in Australia, United States, United Kingdom and most other countries. The increase in CO(2) levels associated with global warming will increase the likelihood of carbonation-induced corrosion. Moreover, temperature rises will increase corrosion rates. Clearly, the impact of climate change on existing and new infrastructure is considerable, as corrosion damage is disruptive to society and costly to repair. The paper describes a probabilistic and reliability-based approach that predicts the probability of corrosion initiation and damage (severe cracking) for concrete infrastructure subjected to carbonation and chloride-induced corrosion resulting from elevated CO(2) levels and temperatures. The atmospheric CO(2) concentration and local temperature and relative humidity changes with time over the next 100 years in the Australian cities of Sydney and Darwin are projected based on nine General Circulation Models (GCMs) under (i) high CO(2) emission scenario, (ii) medium CO(2) emission scenario, and (iii) CO(2) emission reduction scenario based on policy intervention. The probabilistic analysis included the uncertainty of CO(2) concentration, deterioration processes, material properties, dimensions, and predictive models. It was found that carbonation-induced damage risks can increase by over 400% over a time period to 2100 for some regions in Australia. Damage risks for chloride-induced corrosion increase by no more than 15% over the same time period due to temperature increase, but without consideration of ocean acidity change in marine exposure. Corrosion loss of reinforcement is not significant. The results were most sensitive to increases in atmospheric CO(2). (C) 2001 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"A unique energy-independent house ('HARBEMAN house'; HARmony BEtween Man And Nature) incorporating solar thermal, underground coolers, sky radiation cooling, photovoltaic electricity generation and rain-water collection was built in Sendai (latitude; 38 degrees 17'00 "" north and longitude; 140 degrees 50'14 "" east), Japan during July, 1996. The average solar energy received on a horizontal surface there in January is 7900 kJ/m(2)/day. This paper reports the experimental results since September 1996 to date. The annual variations of water temperature in the underground main tank, heating/cooling/domestic hot water demands, collected and emitted heats by solar collector and sky radiator, were measured. The paper also clarifies the method of computer simulation results for the HARBEMAN house and its results compared with the annual experimental data. The proposed HARBEMAN house, which meets almost all its energy demands, including space heating and cooling, domestic hot water, electricity generated by photovoltaic cell and rainwater for standard Japanese homes. The proposed system has two operational modes: (i) a long-term thermal energy storage mode extending from September to March and (ii) a long-term cool storage mode extending from April to August. The system is intended to utilize as little energy as possible to collect and emit the heat. This paper also clarifies the primary energy consumption, the external costs (externalities) and the means for the reduction of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions. The primary-energy consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions of the proposed house are only one-tenth of those of the conventional standard house. Moreover, the thermal performance of this house will be compared with the results of the IEA solar low-energy house TASK 13. Finally, this paper validates the external costs of this house, which have been intensively discussed in recent years in European countries. The present energy-sufficient house will be attempting in 21st century to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which will be one of the key factors for mitigating global warming.

Recent century-long experiments performed with global climate models have simulated observed trends in global-mean temperature quite successfully when both greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing has been included. The performance of these same experiments in simulating observed global-scale changes in precipitation has not previously been examined. Here we use a gridded terrestrial precipitation dataset for the period 1900 to 1996 to examine the extent to which observed global and zonal-mean precipitation sensitivities to global warming have been captured by a series of model simulations recently completed by the UK Hadley Centre. There are signs that the model has been able to reproduce at least some of the observed zonal-mean variations in the precipitation sensitivity to warming. Questions remain both about the quality of the observed precipitation data and about the spatial scale at which anthropogenically-forced global climate models can be expected to reproduce observed variations in precipitation.,1
"The paper considers a relation between equilibrium global warming at doubled carbon dioxide (climate sensitivity) and the distribution of clouds and relative humidity in 18 state-of-the-art climate models. There is a strong correlation among three indices: (1) model climate sensitivity, (2) mean cloud amount change due to global warming, and (3) the difference in cloud amount between the tropics and midlatitudes. In the simulation of the present-day current, models with high sensitivity produce smaller clouds amounts in the tropics and larger cloud amounts over midlatitude oceans than models with low sensitivity. The relative humidity in the tropics is smaller in models with high sensitivity than in models with low sensitivity. There is a similarity between vertical profiles of cloud amount and relative humidity under global warming and vertical profiles of the difference in these quantities averaged over the tropics and midlatitudes. Based on the correlations obtained and observations of cloud amount and relative humidity, an estimate is made of the sensitivity of a real climate system.",1
"Methane (CH(4)) is an acknowledged greenhouse gas (GHG), and it is playing more and more important role in global warming. So, CH(4) emission must be controlled in order to restrain the greenhouse effect. However, coalbed methane (CBM) emission is an important source of the methane in the atmosphere. Wherefore, it is of significance to study conversion of CBM to methanol for reducing CH(4) emission into the atmosphere. Technologies of syngas production from CBM, including coupling of CBM deoxygenation and CH(4) steam rearming, coupling of CH(4) partial oxidation and CO(2) rearming, and non-catalytic transforming of CBM, are introduced. The method of making methanol with syngas is also described. Moreover, based on the increase trend of atmospheric methane and the destructive effect of CH(4) on environment, the environmental benefit on methanol production with CBM is discussed. At the same time, those problems, which should be adverted in the process of synthesizing methanol with CBM, are emphasized",1
"As a result of predicted regional climatic changes the need to select for the more drought-tolerant genotypes (ecotypes) among Mediterranean conifers has become clear. Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) seems to be one of the most drought-tolerant pine species. Nevertheless, the existence of geographical trends in their genetic differentiation indicates potentially large differences in drought-tolerance among provenances. This assumption was verified by the finding of large variation among provenances in their internal water relations. Hence, the aim of this stud), was to compare the ecophysiological behaviour of several Aleppo pine provenances under contrasting climatic conditions. Growth parameters (height and diameter) and survival rate were measured in two provenance trials, one planted under sub-desertic conditions at the northern edge of the Negev desert, and the second under thermo-Mediterranean climatic conditions in the central coastal plains, Israel. Ecophysiological parameters such as: predawn needle water potential, sap flow in the xylem (i.e. transpiration), photosynthesis and water-use efficiency were measured in trees of selected provenances. The results suggest that it is not possible to predict provenance performance under harsh conditions from their performance under more favourable ones. Therefore, selection must be carried out under the exact conditions in which the trees from the resultant selection will be planted. The present study clearly emphasises the need for broad selection programs of P. halepensis.",1
"In this study, a solar hybrid theory is derived for the electrosynthesis of energetic molecules at efficiency greater than that for the solar energy conversion efficiency of photovoltaics. The theory distinguishes radiation that drives photovoltaic charge transfer and applies all excess energy to heat and decrease the energy of endothermic electrolysis reactions. The theory for this original process is derived for the solar generation of energetically rich chemicals, including chlorine, iron, aluminum, magnesium, lithium, and sodium, and to proactively convert anthropogenic CO(2) generated in burning fossil fuels. The process directs energy sufficient (super-bandgap) sunlight to drive photovoltaic charge transfer, and all remaining (sub-bandgap and excess super-bandgap energy) sunlight to heat and decrease the energy of ail electrolysis reaction. In a 650 degrees C molten carbonate electrolysis configuration, from the STEP (solar thermal electrochemical photo) conversion theory, Sunlight will recycle and remove CO(2) at 50% solar efficiency in a cell with similar to 58 mbar CO and 1 bar Of CO(2).",1
"Analysis of lower carbon power systems has tended to focus on the operational carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from power stations. However, to achieve the large cuts required it is necessary to understand the whole-life contribution of all sectors of the electricity industry. Here, a preliminary assessment of the life cycle carbon emissions of the transmission network in Great Britain is presented. Using a 40-year period and assuming a static generation mix it shows that the carbon equivalent emissions (or global warming potential) of the transmission network are around 11 gCO(2-eq)/kWh of electricity transmitted and that almost 19 times more energy is transmitted by the network than is used in its construction and operation. Operational emissions account for 96% of this with transmission losses alone totalling 85% and sulphur hexafluoride (SF(6)) emissions featuring significantly. However, the CO(2) embodied within the raw materials of the network infrastructure itself represents a modest 3%. Transmission investment decisions informed by whole-life cycle carbon assessments of network design could balance higher financial and carbon 'capital' costs of larger conductors with lower transmission losses and CO(2) emissions over the network lifetime. This will, however, necessitate new regulatory approaches to properly incentivise transmission companies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"A recent (2002) analysis concluded that rates of tropical deforestation and atmospheric carbon emissions during the 1990-1997 interval were lower than previously suggested. We challenged this assertion with respect to tropical carbon emissions, but our conclusions were disputed by the authors of the original study. Here we provide further evidence to support our conclusion that the effect of tropical deforestation on greenhouse-gas emissions and global warming is substantial. At least for Brazilian Amazonia, the net impact of tropical deforestation on global warming may be more than double that estimated in the recent study.",1
"The purpose of the study was to assess the effect that global war ming and changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration would have on grassland production within Scotland. This required the development of a mathematical model of herbage production that was responsive to climatic factors and changes in CO2 levels. A model of pure grass and grass-white clover swards is described, and this has been used to assess the effects that the predicted increases in temperature, rainfall and CO2 might have on grass and white clover production. It is projected that global warming will increase the length of the growing season by between 12 and 37 days for every 1 degrees C rise in annual mean daily temperature. The indications are that global warming will have little effect on annual production of grass, either from pure grass or grass-white clover swards. On the other hand, white clover as a percentage of total herbage production is estimated to increase from 32% to 46% for a 2 degrees C temperature rise. Nevertheless, increasing concentrations of CO2 is predicted to increase the yields of grass and white clover under both current climatic conditions and the global warming scenario.

"Global warming due to increased greenhouse gases is believed to result in not only higher surface temperatures but also an acceleration of the hydrological cycle leading to increased precipitation. Although climate models consistently predict increases in global temperatures due to increasing greenhouse gases and the accompanying global warming, observations at the climatic timescales necessary to confirm the models are rare. Multidecadal studies at global and regional scales are necessary to determine whether the presently observed changes in temperature and precipitation are due to short-term fluctuations or long-term trends. In this study, we address this issue by examining changes in temperature and precipitation on Long Island, New York over a 74-year time period (1931 to 2004) using a network of rain gauges and temperature measurements. The mean annual temperature on Long Island has increased at a rate of 0.05 degrees C per decade, which is less than that of observed global values and is most likely due to the urban warming effects of New York City, not large-scale climate change. The mean total annual precipitation has increased at a rate of 0.71 cm per decade during the study period, which is consistent with global observations. Intra-annual temperature fluctuations are decreasing at a rate of 0.36% per decade, while precipitation variations are increasing at a rate of 0. 91 % per decade. Empirical orthogonal function analysis indicates that variations in temperature and precipitation on Long Island are dominated by island-wide fluctuations that are directly related to the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation.",1
"We are increasingly impressed with the idea that the climate system must be treated globally, and, by the same token, most contaminants affecting the Arctic and its climate have global origins. This is manifestly true of carbon dioxide and its influence on surface temperature through the greenhouse effect, and of chlorofluorocarbons that affect both the surface temperature and stratospheric ozone. In both of these cases, the response of the Arctic is more dramatic than that in the lower latitudes. Another type of contaminant that affects the Arctic climate in the springtime is the light-absorbing aerosols transported northward from industrial regions. Moreover, the Arctic includes several unique regional climatic feedback mechanisms, such as the effect that a global warming can have on the release of carbon dioxide and methane locked in the tundra and taiga (probably a positive feedback), and the effect of shrinking sea ice and snowcover on the heat balance of the hemisphere (definitely a positive feedback). It has long been recognized that changes in ocean circulations, notably in the North Atlantic and Greenland Sea, can have a dominant effect on regional and global temperatures. All of these effects are unfortunately poorly treated in current climate and ecosystem models, and this introduces an element of uncertainty in predictions of global warming and the fate of contaminants in the Arctic.",1
"NO is a key mediator of hypoxic vasodilation, but the precise role of RBC Hb remains controversial. In addition to established theories that depend on RBC uptake, delivery, and discharge of NO or its metabolites, an alternative hypothesis based on RBC permeability is suggested. NO depletion by free Hb may account for several clinical features seen during intravascular hemolysis or during deliberate infusion of Hb solutions used as RBC substitutes. CO(2) released by tissues triggers oxygen release through a series of well-coordinated reactions centered on the Band 3 metabolon. While RBC carbonic anhydrase and the Band 3 anion exchanger are central to this process, there is surprisingly little research on the kinetics of CO(2) clearance by transfusion. The three RBC gases are directly related to the three principal gases of Earth's atmosphere. Human fossil fuel consumption dumps 90 million metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere annually. Increasing CO(2) levels are linked to global warming, melting Arctic ice, rising sea levels, and climate instability. Just as individual cells depend on balance of the three vital gases, so too will their balance determine survival of life on Earth.",1
"Global climate change over the coming decades of the magnitude predicted by current climate models may have a variety of deleterious health effects on the human population. Adverse health effects may also follow from the projected depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. These effects are the subject of a report prepared by a task group set up by the World Health Organization, the World Meteorological Organization, and the UN Environment Programme-Climate Change and Human Health, edited by A. J. McMichael, A. Haines, R. Slooff, and S. Kovats (Geneva: WHO, 1996; for a review see PDR 22, no.4). The report briefly summarizes the consensus views of Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on future climate trends and then assesses potential routes of impact on health-directly through temperature changes and more frequent extreme weather events, and indirectly through (for example) changes in the geographic range of disease vectors or the ''social-demographic disruptions caused by rising sea level.'' The task group's recommendations principally call for closer monitoring of health outcomes and for long-term, multidisciplinary research. The excerpt below is the initial section (pp. 215-217) of Chapter 10: Recommendations and conclusions. Through overlaps in authorship and in the research base drawn on, the WHO report substantially resembles the treatment of the health effects of climate change in the 1995 IPCC report (see Chapter 18: Human population health, in Climate Change 1995. Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-Technical Analyses. Contribution of Working Group II to the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC.

"Climatic effects of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) differ from those of long-lived greenhouse gases, because they occur rapidly after emission and because they depend upon the region of emission. The distinctive temporal and spatial nature of these impacts is not captured by measures that rely on global averages or long time integrations. Here, we propose a simple measure, the Specific Forcing Pulse (SFP), to quantify climate warming or cooling by these pollutants, where we define ""immediate"" as occurring primarily within the first year after emission. SFP is the amount of energy added to or removed from a receptor region in the Earth-atmosphere system by a chemical species, per mass of emission in a source region. We limit the application of SFP to species that remain in the atmosphere for less than one year. Metrics used in policy discussions, such as total forcing or global warming potential, are easily derived from SFP. However, SFP conveys purely physical information without incurring the policy implications of choosing a time horizon for the global warming potential. Using one model (Community Atmosphere Model, or CAM), we calculate values of SFP for black carbon (BC) and organic matter (OM) emitted from 23 source-region combinations. Global SFP for both atmosphere and cryosphere impacts is divided among receptor latitudes. SFP is usually greater for open-burning emissions than for energy-related (fossil-fuel and biofuel) emissions because of the timing of emission. Global SFP for BC varies by about 45% for energy-related emissions from different regions. This variation would be larger except for compensating effects. When emitted aerosol has larger cryosphere forcing, it often has lower atmosphere forcing because of less deep convection and a shorter atmospheric lifetime. A single model result is insufficient to capture uncertainty. We develop a best estimate and uncertainties for SFP by combining forcing results from 12 additional models. We outline a framework for combining a large number of simple models with a smaller number of enhanced models that have greater complexity. Adjustments for black carbon internal mixing and for regional variability are discussed. Emitting regions with more deep convection have greater model diversity. Our best estimate of global-mean SFP is +03 +/- 0.52 GJ g(-1) for direct atmosphere forcing of black carbon, +15 +/- 0.53 GJ g(-1) for black carbon including direct and cryosphere forcing, and -0.064 (-0.02, -0.13) GJ g(-1) for organic matter. These values depend on the region and timing of emission. The lowest OM: BC mass ratio required to produce a neutral effect on top-of-atmosphere direct forcing is 15: 1 for any region. Any lower ratio results in positive direct forcing. However, important processes, particularly cloud changes that tend toward cooling, have not been included here. Global-average SFP for energy-related emissions can be converted to a 100-year GWP of about 740 +/- 370 for BC without snow forcing, and 830 +/- 440 with snow forcing. 100-year GWP for OM is -46 (-18, -92). Best estimates of atmospheric radiative impact (without snow forcing) by black and organic matter are +0.47 +/- 0.26 W m(-2) and -0.17 (-0.07, -0.35) W m(-2) for BC and OM, respectively, assuming total emission rates of 7.4 and 45 Tg yr(-1). Anthropogenic forcing is +0.40 +/- 0.18 W m(-2) and -0.13 (-0.05, -0.25) W m(-2) for BC and OM, respectively, assuming anthropogenic emission rates of 6.3 and 32.6 Tg yr(-1). Black carbon forcing is only 18% higher than that given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), although the value presented here includes enhanced absorption due to internal mixing.",1
"The objective of this study was to simulate potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber yield in different climate change scenarios of increased carbon dioxide concentration [CO(2)] and air temperature, considering symmetric and asymmetric increases in minimum and maximum daily air temperatures. Spitters model was used to simulate Asterix cultivar tuber yield considering two growing seasons (spring and fall) recommended for Santa Maria, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In each growing season, five planting dates were evaluated in climate scenarios of a hundred years with no increase in [CO(2)] and temperature (current scenario), and in scenarios with doubling [CO(2)] and temperature increases of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 degrees C. A symmetric increase of 4 degrees C and an asymmetric increase of 5 degrees C in air temperature offset the yield beneficial effect of increasing [CO(2)] during spring, whereas increase in air temperature does not affect potato tuber yield during fall. Anticipating planting date in spring and delaying it in fall decrease the negative impact of the increasing air temperature on potato tuber yield.",1
"The global warming issue has resulted in a great demand in zero emission power generation systems. Recently a few new concepts have been proposed that promise to achieve zero emissions while delivering unprecedentedly high efficiency. In these concepts, CO2 adsorbing material (CAM) is a key component. This paper reviews briefly the current development in CO2 adsorbing material, screens the potential materials under the conditions relevant to those in zero emission power generation systems, and identifies the best candidate and the optimum operating conditions for the production of high-purity hydrogen. It is found that CaO is thermodynamically the best candidate among metal oxides for CO2 capture in zero emission power generation systems. There exists a region within which high-purity H-2 can be produced in steam methane reforming and carbon gasification.",1
"Greenhouse gases such as CO2 are the primary cause of global warming. One of the best routes to remedy CO2 is to transform it to hydrocarbons using photo reduction. CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol using a Hg lamp with wavelength 365 nm in a steady-state optical fiber photoreactor. The optical-fiber photoreactor, comprised of nearly 120 CU/TiO2-coated fibers, was designed and assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly inside the reactor. TiO2 film was coated on optical fiber using a dip-coating method. Cu-loaded titania solutions were prepared by a thermal hydrolysis method. The thickness of Cu/TiO2 film was 53 nm. The coating film consisted of very fine spherical particles with diameters of near 14 nm. The XRD spectra indicated the anatase phase for all TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 films. The wavelength of absorption edge on Cu/ TiO2 was near 367 nm, equivalent to a bandgap of 3.3 eV. The most active Cu species on TiO2 surface were Cu2O clusters, and they played an important role for the formation of methanol. The methanol yield increased with UV irradiative intensity. Maximum methanol rate was 0.45 mu mole/g cat h using 2 wt.%-Cu/TiO2 catalyst at 29 bar of CO2, 0.026 bar of H2O, and 5000 s mean residence time under 16 W/cm(2) UV irradiation. Higher than 2 wt.% Cu loading gave a lower rate of methanol yield because of the masking effect Of Cu2O clusters on the TiO2 surface. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was established by correlating experimental data to describe the kinetic behavior. An optimum pressure ratio of H2O/CO2 was found in the photo reduction of CO2 for maximum methanol yield. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"In recent years, the problem of global warming has become serious, and it has become an important challenge for architects to reduce the environmental burden of buildings. In response, Fujitsu has developed facilities management systems called Futuric that make buildings safer and more comfortable by collecting information about equipment in buildings and then making it available for management and control purposes. Lately, however, more importance has been attached to reducing environmental burden by providing energy-conservation functions for entire buildings. The Futuric facilities management systems have various energy conservation functions in their building energy and environment management systems (BEMSs) to support environmental burden reduction. This paper introduces the Futuric systems and describes how they help reduce a building's environmental burden using an example introduction in an office building.",1
"Climate change has been linked to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases including CH(4), which has a global warming potential 25 times greater than CO(2). Stored liquid animal manure is an important emissions source of CH(4) globally and in Canada. As part of ongoing efforts to mitigate CH(4) emissions, it may be beneficial to obtain field scale flux estimates which can be used to verify CH(4) emission factors. The objective of this study was to measure CH(4) fluxes from a liquid dairy manure storage tank and compare measured fluxes with predicted values using US EPA methodology. Fluxes were measured from a circular concrete tank 125 m in diameter storing liquid dairy manure in Bright, Ontario, Canada. Measurements were conducted semi-continuously from January through July 2003, using a tunable diode laser and the non-interfering micrometeorological mass balance method. Monthly average CH(4) flux ranged from 11 mu g/m(2)/s in June after the tank had been emptied, to 153 mu g/m(2)/s in July. Large bubble flux events occurred in February and March that coincided with surface thawing. Predicted emissions using the US EPA approach with carryover of volatile solids showed overestimation unless a substantial correction factor was used. In contrast, if volatile solids were not carried over, predicted fluxes had acceptable agreement with measurements.

"Nitrogen (N) losses following land-applied animal wastes present an environmental and economical dilemma for producers. Gaseous N losses from pasture-land contribute to global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, and inefficient plant N uptake. This study was designed to monitor nitrous oxide emissions following swine waste and commercial fertilizer treatments to bermudagrass (Cynedon dactylon [L.] pers) pastures. Denitrification rates were monitored on a biweekly basis for six 0.12-ha bermudagrass pastures for three consecutive growing seasons (1998-2000). Treatments consisted of three split applications of either swine effluent supplemented with ammonium nitrate (SW) or commercial fertilizer (CF). Peak denitrification rates were greatest in 1998, ranging from 0.6 to 7 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) for effluent-treated plots and 0.3-5 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) for commercially fertilized plots. Results from this study suggest denitrification is not a significant N loss pathway in swine waste-amended bermudagrass systems.",1
"In order to explore for the most effective strategy for using forests to mitigate global climate change, we have constructed a simple model of C uptake during forest growth and the fate of this C when forests are harvested and used as fuel to replace fossil fuels. We suggest that trees are equally effective in preventing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere if they remove a unit of C from the atmosphere or if they supply a sustainable source of energy that substitutes for a unit of C discharged by burning fossil fuels. The model shows that the most effective strategy for using forest land to minimize increases in atmospheric CO2 will depend on the current status of the land, the productivity that can be expected, the efficiency with which the forest harvest is used to substitute for fossil fuels, and thc time perspective of the analysis. For forests with large standing biomass and low productivity the most effective strategy is to protect the existing forest. For land with little standing biomass and low productivity, the most effective strategy is to reforest or otherwise manage the land for forest growth and C storage. Where high productivity can bc expected, thc most effective strategy is to manage the forest for a harvestable crop and to use the harvest with maximum efficiency either for long-lived products or to substitute for fossil fuels. The longer the time perspective, the more likely that harvesting and replanting will result in net C benefits.",1
"The geographic distribution, vigor, virulence, and agricultural impact of weeds, insects, and plant pathogens will be affected by climatic changes accompanying the global ""greenhouse effect."" Weed/crop competitive interactions, particularly among species differing in photosynthetic pathway (C(3) v C(4)), may be altered, with the C(3) species favored by increasing CO(2). Physiological and biochemical changes induced in host crop plants by rising CO(2) may affect feeding patterns of pest insects. Compilation of climatic thresholds for phenological development of pest insects reveals the potential for shifts in pest behavior induced by global warming and other climatic change. Generation times may be reduced, enabling more rapid population increases to occur. Poleward migration may be accelerated during the crop season. The epidemiology of plant diseases also will be altered. Prediction of disease outbreaks will be more difficult in periods of rapidly changing climate and unstable weather. Environmental instability and increased incidence of extreme weather may reduce the effectiveness of pesticides on targeted pests or result in more injury to non-target organisms. Biological control may be affected either negatively or positively. Overall, the challenge to agriculture from pests probably will increase.",1

"Reorganizations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation were associated with large and abrupt climatic changes in the North Atlantic region during the last glacial period(1-4). Projections with climate models suggest that similar reorganizations may also occur in response to anthropogenic global warming(5-7). Here I use ensemble simulations with a coupled climate-ecosytem model of intermediate complexity to investigate the possible consequences of such disturbances to the marine ecosystem. In the simulations, a disruption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation leads to a collapse of the North Atlantic plankton stocks to less than half of their initial biomass, owing to rapid shoaling of winter mixed layers and their associated separation from the deep ocean nutrient reservoir. Globally integrated export production declines by more than 20 per cent owing to reduced upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water and gradual depletion of upper ocean nutrient concentrations. These model results are consistent with the available high-resolution palaeorecord, and suggest that global ocean productivity is sensitive to changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.",1
"Two versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model (CCM) are used to calculate the increase in solar energy absorbed by the Earth-atmosphere system if all sea ice on the planet were to melt. The increase in solar energy is determined at several time points in the seasonal cycle by brief integrations of the models with the surface albedo of sea ice changed to that of open ocean; temperature, cloudiness, and other climate parameters are unchanged during the short integrations, so that our results isolate the climatic effect of sea ice albedo changes in the absence of other processes and feedbacks. (In particular, we do not include the effects of removing the insulation between ocean underneath sea ice and the atmosphere above it.) We find that the globally and annually averaged enhancement of absorbed solar flux due to removal of sea ice is 2-3 W m-2; a simple calculation indicates that most of the difference between model versions is due to differences in the surface albedo of sea ice. About half the albedo reduction at the surface is masked at the top of the atmosphere by clouds, even though the CCM versions we use tend to underestimate cloudiness. Our upper limit is significant compared to the direct radiative forcing of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, but it suggests that for greenhouse gas warming equivalent to doubling of CO2 or greater, the sea ice albedo feedback is likely to be smaller than from water vapor and potentially that from clouds.",1
"Sea turtles rely on reef islands for key parts of their reproductive cycle and require specific sediment characteristics to incubate their eggs and dig their nests. However, little is known about the sedimentological characteristics of sea turtle rookeries, how these sediment characteristics affect the vulnerability of rookeries to climate change, and the ecological implications of different sediment or altered sediment characteristics to sea turtles. Therefore, we described the sediment and identified the reef-building organisms of the seven most important rookeries used by the northern Great Barrier Reef (nGBR) green turtle population. We then reviewed the literature on the vulnerability of each identified reef-building organism to climate change and how various sediment characteristics ecologically affect sea turtles. Sediments from the studied rookeries are predominantly composed of well-sorted medium-grained to coarse-grained sands and are either dominated by Foraminifera, molluscs or both. Dissimilarities in the contemporary sedimentology of the rookeries suggest that each may respond differently to projected climate change. Potential ecological impacts from climate change include: (1) changes in nesting and hatchling emergence success and (2) reduction of optimal nesting habitat. Each of these factors will decrease the annual reproductive output of sea turtles and thus have significant conservation ramifications.",1
"Reef development during past Interglacial periods, when sea level and sea surface temperatures were higher than today, provide unique insights into how reef systems may respond to projected human-induced global warming. Lord Howe Island currently represents the southernmost limit of reef development in the Pacific. Reef growth of Pleistocene age has been inferred to have occurred around the island, and this paper provides the first detailed descriptions on the character of this development. Two phases of reef growth are identified, which occurred as isolated fringing reefs along the edge of the basaltic hills of the island. Uranium-series dating indicates that the upper part of the sequence is of Last Interglacial age, however extensive calcite recrystallisation meant the lower part of the sequence does not yield reliable ages. Calcite cements suggest that several phases of recrystallisation have occurred meaning the lower part of the sequence is most likely to represent reef of Penultimate Interglacial age. Component analysis of the sedimentary matrix within the reef indicates coralline algae dominated sands which are very similar to the modern reef environment. This suggests that the environment at Lord Howe Island has remained at or close to the environmental limits for reef growth during the past few interglacials, despite lithospheric plate motion moving this island further north into reef building seas.",1
"The global concern over the greenhouse gas emissions and its effect on global warming and climate change has focused attention on the necessity of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. There are many processes proposed to capture carbon either before or after combustion and these processes invariably involve investigation and application of traditional particuology. The solids employed are of different sizes, densities, morphologies. and strengths. Their handling, transportation, recirculation, and reactor applications are the essence of 'particuology'. Particuology can play an important and vital role in achieving cost-effective removal of carbon and minimize emissions of greenhouse gases. In this paper, the existing and developing carbon capture processes are briefly reviewed and the opportunities for application of particuology are identified. The review was not intended to be exhaustive. It is only in sufficient detail to make connection between particuology and climate change. For immediate and future challenges of reducing global warming and carbon capture and sequestration, innovative reactor design and application of particuology is imperative. Expertise and innovation in particuology can greatly enhance the speed of development of those technologies and help to achieve cost-effective implementation. Particuology is indeed intimately related to the climate change and global warming. (C) 2010 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

"The long-term adjustment processes of atmosphere and ocean in response to gradually increased atmospheric CO2 concentration have been analyzed in 70 and 140 a integrations with NCAR fully-coupled climate system model (CSM). In these experiments the CO2 concentration has been increased to double and quadruples the initial concentration, respectively. After 70 a, at the time of CO2 doubling, the model predicts surface air temperature rises by 2 and 5 K for the globe and the northwestern Pacific Ocean, respectively. The behavior of the quadrupling run is similar: each global and regional mean surface air temperatures increase by 2.8 and 3.0 K at the time of CO2 quadrupling. From the experiments, surface air temperature changes in the northwestern Pacific Ocean will be more distinctive compared with the global average, mainly due to exceptionally large warming and sea level change near the entrance of the Kuroshio extension.",1
"Agriculture is one of the key sectors of the Sri Lankan economy, which contributes a significant percentage to its gross domestic product (GDP) and provides direct or indirect employment to a sizeable proportion of its population. Climate change involves long-term slow changes in climate, short-term year-to-year climatic variability and unpredictable extreme climatic events. Agriculture, especially crop production, is highly dependent on the prevailing weather conditions and therefore is highly sensitive to climate change, both short-term and long-term. Almost all General Circulation Models predict that the processes of climate change such as increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and global warming will continue well into the 21(st) century even If the mitigation measures to minimize the causes of climate change exert maximum effect. Therefore, it is imperative that a well-co-ordinated and sustained effort is set in motion to increase the capacity of Sri Lankan agriculture to adapt to short and long-term climate change. Adaptation involves measures to minimize the impacts of climate change. At present, implementation of climate change adaptation measures in Sri Lanka is piecemeal and lacks co-ordination and direction. Hence, a clear policy framework identifying the measures to be pursued and the roles of different stakeholders is needed for allocating and channelling the necessary financial and human resources for successful adaptation to climate change. A clear and comprehensive policy framework also becomes the basis for development of an effective road map and an action plan to achieve successful adaptation. This paper discusses a policy framework for adaptation of Sri Lankan agriculture to climate change based on the following components: (a) Quantification and forecasting of climate change; (b) Assessment of impacts and vulnerability to climate change; (c) Identification and formulation of responses to adapt to climate change; (d) Creating and strengthening the institutional framework and infrastructure to implement and monitor adaptation measures to climate change. Major advances in scientific research on components a, b and c, both locally and internationally, are briefly discussed and key policy measures to facilitate and accelerate their progress along with the relevant stakeholders are identified. Importance of allocating adequate resources to promote research on all aspects of climate change and their impacts by developing infrastructure, a critical mass of experts and an institutional framework to effectively link all stakeholders to channel the formulated adaptation measures to the farming communities at the grass-root level are emphasized.",1
"Biofuels demand is unquestionable in order to reduce gaseous emissions (fossil CO(2), nitrogen and sulfur oxides) and their purported greenhouse, climatic changes and global warming effects, to face the frequent oil supply crises, as a way to help non-fossil fuel producer countries to reduce energy dependence, contributing to security of supply, promoting environmental sustainability and meeting the EU target of at least of 10% biofuels in the transport sector by 2020. Biodiesel is usually produced from oleaginous crops, such as rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and palm. However, the use of microalgae can be a suitable alternative feedstock for next generation biofuels because certain species contain high amounts of oil, which could be extracted, processed and refined into transportation fuels, using currently available technology; they have fast growth rate, permit the use of non-arable land and non-potable water, use far less water and do not displace food crops cultures; their production is not seasonal and they can be harvested daily. The screening of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Spirulina maxima, Nannochloropsis sp., Neochloris oleabundans, Scenedesmus obliquus and Dunaliella tertiolecta) was done in order to choose the best one(s), in terms of quantity and quality as oil source for biofuel production. Neochloris oleabundans (fresh water microalga) and Nannochloropsis sp. (marine microalga) proved to be suitable as raw materials for biofuel production, due to their high oil content (29.0 and 28.7%, respectively). Both microalgae, when grown under nitrogen shortage, show a great increase (50%) in oil quantity. If the purpose is to produce biodiesel only from one species, Scenedesmus obliquus presents the most adequate fatty acid profile, namely in terms of linolenic and other polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the microalgae Neochloris oleabundans, Nannochloropsis sp. and Dunaliella tertiolecta can also be used if associated with other microalgal oils and/or vegetable oils.",1
"Island tropical montane cloud forests may be among the most sensitive of the world's ecosystems to global climate change. Measurements in and above a montane cloud forest on East Maul, Hawaii, document steep microclimatic gradients. Relatively small climate-driven shifts in patterns of atmospheric circulation are likely to trigger major local changes in rainfall, cloud cover, and humidity. Increased interannual variability in precipitation and hurricane incidence would provide additional stresses on island biota that are highly vulnerable to disturbance-related invasion of nonnative species. Because of the exceptional sensitivity of these microclimates and forests to change, they may provide valuable 'listening posts' for detecting the onset of human-induced global climate change.",1
"Anaerobic digestion (AD) of source-separated municipal solid waste (MSW) and use of the digestate is presented from a global warming (GW) point of view by providing ranges of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are useful for calculation of global warming factors (GWFs), i.e. the contribution to GW measured in CO2-equivalents per tonne of wet waste. The GHG accounting was done by distinguishing between direct contributions at the AD facility and indirect upstream or downstream contributions. GHG accounting for a generic AD facility with either biogas utilization at the facility or upgrading of the gas for vehicle fuel resulted in a GWF from -375 (a saving) to 111 (a load) kg CO2-eq.tonne(-1) wet waste. In both cases the digestate was used for fertilizer substitution. This large range was a result of the variation found for a number of key parameters: energy substitution by biogas, N2O-emission from digestate in soil, fugitive emission of CH4, unburned CH4, carbon bound in soil and fertilizer substitution. GWF for a specific type of AD facility was in the range -95 to -4 kg CO2-eq.tonne(-1) wet waste. The ranges of uncertainty, especially of fugitive losses of CH4 and carbon sequestration highly influenced the result. In comparison with the few published GWFs for AD, the range of our data was much larger demonstrating the need to use a consistent and robust approach to GHG accounting and simultaneously accept that some key parameters are highly uncertain.",1
"An analysis of Atlantic hurricane data (HURDAT), using a hurricane activity index that integrates over hurricane numbers, durations, and strengths during the years 1851-2007, suggests a quasi-periodic behavior with a period around 60 years superimposed upon a linearly increasing background. The linearly increasing background is significantly reduced or removed when various corrections were applied for hurricane undercounting in the early portion of the record. The periodic-like behavior is persistent in uncorrected HURDAT data as well as in data corrected for possible missing storms. The record contains two complete cycles: 1860-1920 and 1920-1980. The 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons were unusual in that two intense hurricane seasons occurred in consecutive years. The probability for this happening in any given year is estimated to be less then 1%. Comparing the last 28 years (1980-2007) with the preceding 28 years (1953-1980), we find a modest increase in the number of minor hurricanes (category 1 and 2); however, we find no increase in the number of major hurricanes (category 3-5). The hurricane activity index is found to be highly correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Mode (AMM). If there is an increase in hurricane activity connected to a greenhouse gas induced global warming, it is currently obscured by the 60 year quasi-periodic cycle.",1
"Global warming simulations are performed with a coupled climate model of reduced complexity to investigate global warming-marine carbon cycle feedbacks. The model is forced by emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse agents from scenarios recently developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and by CO2 stabilization profiles. The uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean is reduced between 7 to 10% by year 2100 compared to simulations without global warming. The reduction is of similar size in the Southern Ocean and in low-latitude regions (32.5(-) S-32.5 degreesN) until 2100, whereas low-latitude regions dominate on longer time scales. In the North Atlantic the CO2 uptake is enhanced, unless the Atlantic thermohaline circulation completely collapses. At high latitudes. biologically mediated changes enhance ocean CO2 uptake, whereas in low-latitude regions the situation is reversed. Different implementations of the marine biosphere yield a range of 5 to 16% for the total reduction in oceanic CO2 uptake until year 2100. Modeled oceanic O-2 inventories are significantly reduced in global warming simulations. This suggests that the terrestrial carbon sink deduced from atmospheric O-2/N-2 observations is potentially overestimated if the oceanic loss of O-2 to the atmosphere is not considered.",1
"Since the early 1960s, the declining phase of the atmosphere's seasonal CO2 cycle has advanced by approximately 7 days in northern temperate latitudes, possibly as a result of increasing temperatures that may be advancing the time of occurrence of what may be called 'climatological spring.' However, just as several different phenomena are thought to have been responsible for the concomitant increase in the amplitude of the atmosphere's seasonal CO2 oscillation, so too may other factors have played a role in bringing about the increasingly earlier spring drawdown of CO2 that has resulted in the advancement of the declining phase of the air's CO2 cycle. One of these factors may be the ongoing rise in the CO2 content of the air itself; for the aerial fertilization effect of this phenomenon may be significantly enhancing the growth of each new season's initial flush of vegetation, which would tend to stimulate the early drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and thereby advance the time of occurrence of what could be called 'biological spring.' Working with sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) trees that have been growing out-of-doors in open-top chambers for over 10 years in air of either 400 or 700 ppm CO2, this hypothesis was investigated by periodically measuring the lengths, dry weights and leaf chlorophyll concentrations of new branches that emerged from the trees at the start of the 1998 growing season. The data demonstrate that the hypothesis is viable, and that it might possibly account for 2 of the 7 days by which the spring drawdown of the air's CO2 concentration has advanced over the past few decades.

"The technology of amine-based carbon dioxide (CO(2)) capture has been widely adopted for reducing CO(2) emissions and mitigating global warming. The primary research objective in the field of post-combustion CO(2) capture process system is to improve effectiveness and efficiency of the process. Extensive literature review of the research showed that the dominant approach was to investigate the behaviors of the aqueous amine solvents for enchancing CO(2) capture efficiency. As the operation of an amine-based CO(2) capture system is complicated and involves monitoring over one hundred process parameters and careful manipulation of numerous valves and pumps, automated monitoring and process control can be a fruitful approach to enhance efficiency of the CO(2) capture process system. In this study, artificial intelligence techniques were applied for development of a knowledge-based expert system that effectively monitors and controls the CO(2) capture process system so as to enhance CO(2) capture efficiency. The Knowledge-Based System for Carbon Dioxide Capture (KBSCDC) was implemented with DeltaV Simulate (trademark of Emerson Corp., USA). DeltaV Simulate provides control utilities and algorithms which support the configuration of control strategies in modular components. The KBSCDC can conduct real-time monitoring and diagnosis, as well as suggest remedies for any abnormality detected. Also, the control strategies applied to the control devices of the process are simulated in KBSCDC. The expert system enhances performance and efficiency of the CO(2) capture process system because it supports automated diagnosis of the system should any abnormal conditions occur. In this way, costly downtime and maintenance are avoided.",1
We discuss the potential variations of the biological pump that can be expected from a change in the oceanic circulation in the ongoing global warming. The biogeochemical model is based on the assumption of a perfect stoichiometric composition (Redfield ratios) of organic material. Upwelling nutrients are transformed into organic particles that sink to the deep ocean according to observed profiles. The physical circulation model is driven by the warming pattern as derived from scenario computations of a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model. The amplitude of the warming is determined from the varying concentration of atmospheric CO2. The model predicts a pronounced weakening of the thermohaline overturning. This is connected with a reduction of the transient uptake capacity of the ocean. It yields also a more effective removal of organic material from the surface which partly compensates the physical effects of solubility. Both effects are rather marginal for the evolution of atmospheric pCO(2). Running climate models and carbon cycle models separately seems to be justified.,1
"The Romagna coastal area in the Northern Adriatic Sea has experienced in recent times continuous changes because of its precarious environment and low ground elevation above mean sea level (msl). Major processes that may influence the stability of the coast profile include land subsidence of both natural and anthropogenic origin and the msl rise caused by global climate change. According to the most accredited modeling predictions msl is expected to rise by almost 0.5 m over the next century because of the greenhouse effect. Natural land subsidence is the result of deep downward tectonic movement and consolidation of geologically recent deposits. It may be estimated in the range of 2-2.5 mm/yr in the Ravenna area and twice as much in the Po River delta. Anthropogenic land subsidence is primarily related to groundwater pumping from the upper fresh water aquifer system and gas production from Plio-Pleistocene reservoirs. Geodetic surveys from 1953 to 1990 provide documentary evidence of cumulative land settlement exceeding 0.8 m and 2 m at Marina di Ravenna and Cesenatico, respectively. In this study we estimate both natural and anthropogenic land subsidence for the years 2015, 2050, and 2100 with the aid of ad hoc finite element simulation models. The use of these predictions together with the expected msl rise shows that many present lowlands may be permanently submerged at the end of the next century. The extent of the flooded area of the Romagna coastal region can be as much as 690 and 910 km(2), using optimistic and pessimistic land subsidence scenarios, respectively. A local detailed analysis indicates that the areas around the cities of Ravenna and Cesenatico may be seriously affected by sea water ingression while the city of Rimini is well protected because of its relatively high elevation above msl.",1
"Future sea level rise from thermal expansion of the World Ocean due to global warming has been explored in several recent studies using coupled ocean-atmosphere models. These coupled models show that the heat input by the model atmosphere to the ocean in such an event could be quite non-uniform in different areas of the ocean. One of the most significant effects predicted by some of the models is a weakening of the thermohaline circulation, which normally transports heat poleward. Since the greatest heat input from enhanced greenhouse warming is in the higher latitudes, a weakening of the poleward heat transport effectively redistributes the heat anomaly and the associated sea level rise to lower latitudes. In this study, the mechanism of ocean circulation spindown and heat redistribution was studied in the context of a much simpler, linearized shallow water model. Although the model is much simpler than the three-dimensional ocean circulation models used in the coupled model experiments, and neglects several important physical effects, it has a nearly 10-fold increase in horizontal resolution and clearer dynamical interpretations. The results indicated that advanced signals of sea level rise propagated rapidly through the action of Kelvin and Rossby waves, but the full adjustment toward a more uniform sea level rise took place much more slowly. Long time scales were required to redistribute mass through narrow currents trapped along coasts and the equatorial wave guide. For realistic greenhouse warming, the model showed why the sea level rise due to ocean heating could be far from uniform over the globe and hence difficult to estimate from coastal tide gauge stations.",1
"In order to quantitatively compare the greenhouse effect of different greenhouse gases a global warming potential (GWP) index has been used which is based on the ratio of the radiative forcing of an equal emission of two different gases, integrated either over all time or up to an arbitrarily determined time horizon. The GWP index is analogous to the ozone depleting potential (ODP) index. However, the GWP index is subject to major conceptual difficulties arising from the fact that the atmospheric lifespan for part of the emitted CO2 is, for all practical purposes, infinite. In addition, there are major uncertainties in the atmospheric lifespans and indirect heating effects of the important greenhouse gases, which are reviewed here. An alternative GWP index is proposed which explicitly takes into account the duration of capital investments in the energy sector and is less sensitive to uncertainties in atmospheric lifespans and radiative heating than the usual GWP index for time horizons longer than the lifespan of the capital investment. The effect of the GWP index proposed here, compared with previous indices, is to shift attention away from short lived gases such as methane and toward CO2.",1
"Current attribution analyses that seek to determine the relative contributions of different forcing agents to observed near-surface temperature changes underestimate the importance of weak signals, such as that due to changes in solar irradiance. Here a new attribution method is applied that does not have a systematic bias against weak signals. It is found that current climate models underestimate the observed climate response to solar forcing over the twentieth century as a whole, indicating that the climate system has a greater sensitivity to solar forcing than do models. The results from this research show that increases in solar irradiance are likely to have had a greater influence on global-mean temperatures in the first half of the twentieth century than the combined effects of changes in anthropogenic forcings. Nevertheless the results confirm previous analyses showing that greenhouse gas increases explain most of the global warming observed in the second half of the twentieth century.",1
"The questioning of the nineteenth century baseline for anthropogenic contributions to global warming is important for its role in a wider debate about the ''framing'' of this problem between the more-developed and less-developed countries of the world. An analysis of this debate raises such potentially important questions as: (1) How do historical/developmental differences among nations affect global warming? (2) How does the prior history of one nation affect the subsequent history of another with respect to global warming? And (3), what are the consequences of the separation in time (and space) of the capacity to exacerbate versus mitigate global warming? The larger question underlying all of these is: What is the relationship between differences in national histories, the problem of global warming, and the development of a global system capable of addressing it?",1
"As published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global warming is a reality and its impact is huge like the increase of extreme weather events, glacier recession, sea level rise and also effects on human health. Among them allergies to airborne pollen might increase or change in pattern due to the invasion of new allergic plants or due to different behavior of plants like earlier flowering. In this study we used the longest Swiss airborne pollen data set to examine the influence of the temperature increase on the time of flowering. In the case of Basel, where pollen data for 39 years are available, it was shown that due to a temperature increase the start of flowering in the case of birch occurred about 13 days earlier. Apart from a shift of the start of the flowering there is also a trend to higher annual birch pollen quantities and an increase in the daily maximal pollen concentration. Due to global warming and because symptoms might appear earlier in the year people suffering from a pollen allergy might face a new unaccustomed situation.",1
"Global surface temperature has increased approximate to 0.2 degrees C per decade in the past 30 years, similar to the warming rate predicted in the 19805 in initial global climate model simulations with transient greenhouse gas changes. Warming is larger in the Western Equatorial Pacific than in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the past century, and we suggest that the increased West-East temperature gradient may have increased the likelihood of strong El Ninos, such as those of 1983 and 1998. Comparison of measured sea surface temperatures in the Western Pacific with paleoclimate data suggests that this critical ocean region, and probably the planet as a whole, is approximately as warm now as at the Holocene maximum and within approximate to 1 degrees C of the maximum temperature of the past million years. We conclude that global warming of more than approximate to 1 degrees C, relative to 2000, will constitute ""dangerous"" climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species.",1
"Capture and sequestration of CO(2) from power plant flue gas have become an important issue in the discussion about global warming. Different concepts of capture are being pursued. The advantages of postcombustion processes, such as processes based on absorption and stripping, is the possibility of retrofitting a state-of-the-art power plant with a capture plant under reasonable effort. Capturing CO(2) by using an absorption/stripping process requires energy in the form of electricity and steam both supplied by the power plant. The capture process thereby reduces the overall efficiency of the power plant by up to 13% pts (percentage points). Apart from the development of new solvents, alternative and novel configurations of the process can lower the energy requirements. Three alternative configurations are economically and technically evaluated and compared to a baseline process represented by a standard absorption/stripping process using monoethanolamine (MEA) as a solvent. Savings in cost of CO(2)-avoided of 2-5% were attained. Regarding the total power required, savings of 4-7% were obtained. The results showed that not the process with the highest energy savings has the lowest cost of CO(2)-avoided, but that the influence of rising in investment costs of more complex configurations cannot be ignored. For a comprehensive analysis of different configurations it is essential to perform both an economic evaluation and a technical study.",1
This paper reports on research that applies econometric time series methods to the analysis of global climate change. The aim of this research was to test hypotheses concerning the causes of the historically observed rise in global temperatures. Longer term applications include quantification of the contribution of different forcing variables to historic warming and use of the model as a module in integrated assessment. Research to date has comprised three stages. In the first stage we used the concept of Granger causality and differences between the temperature record in the northern and southern hemispheres to investigate the causes of temperature increase. In the second stage we tested various global change time series for the presence of stochastic trends. We found that most series contain a stochastic trend with the greenhouse gas series containing I(2) stochastic trends. In the third stage we developed a structural time series to investigate some of the hypotheses suggested by the earlier stages and further tested for the presence of an I(2) trend in hemispheric temperature series. We found that the two temperature series share a common I(2) stochastic trend that may have its source in radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases. There is a second non-stationary component that appears only in the northern hemisphere and appears to be related to radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphur emissions.

"Aim To model long-term trends in plant species distributions in response to predicted changes in global climate. Location Amazonia. Methods The impacts of expected global climate change on the potential and realized distributions of a representative sample of 69 individual Angiosperm species in Amazonia were simulated from 1990 to 2095. The climate trend followed the HADCM2GSa1 scenario, which assumes an annual 1% increase of atmospheric CO2 content with effects mitigated by sulphate forcing. Potential distributions of species in one-degree grid cells were modelled using a suitability index and rectilinear envelope based on bioclimate variables. Realized distributions were additionally limited by spatial contiguity with, and proximity to, known record sites. A size-structured population model was simulated for each cell in the realized distributions to allow for lags in response to climate change, but dispersal was not included. Results In the resulting simulations, 43% of all species became non-viable by 2095 because their potential distributions had changed drastically, but there was little change in the realized distributions of most species, owing to delays in population responses. Widely distributed species with high tolerance to environmental variation exhibited the least response to climate change, and species with narrow ranges and short generation times the greatest. Climate changed most in north-east Amazonia while the best remaining conditions for lowland moist forest species were in western Amazonia. Main conclusions To maintain the greatest resilience of Amazonian biodiversity to climate change as modelled by HADCM2GSa1, highest priority should be given to strengthening and extending protected areas in western Amazonia that encompass lowland and montane forests.",1
"The setting of binding targets for CO(2) emission reductions for 2020 by the European Union (EU) alone has led to concerns that unilateral climate change mitigation may not only hamper the union's competitiveness, but also result in carbon leakage. The paper explores these claims through the deployment of a dynamic, nonlinear, macro-econometric simulation called the Energy-Environment-Economy (E3) Model at the Global Scale (E3MG). In contrast to the generally held view, we argue that overall EU competitiveness may improve. We also argue that unilateral action may be effective in reducing global emissions relative to a no-climate-change-action scenario, although the reduction is very small.",1
"The impact of CO2-induced global warming on the intensities of strong hurricanes is investigated using the GFDL regional high-resolution hurricane prediction system. The large-scale initial conditions and boundary conditions for the regional model experiments, including SSTs, are derived from control and transient CO2 increase experiments with the GFDL R30-resolution global coupled climate model. In a case study approach, 51 northwest Pacific storm cases derived from the global model under present-day climate conditions are simulated with the regional model, along with 51 storm cases for high CO2 conditions. For each case, the regional model is integrated forward for five days without ocean coupling. The high CO2 storms, with SSTs warmer by about 2.2 degrees C on average and higher environmental convective available potential energy (CAPE), are more intense than the control storms by about 3-7 m/s (5%-11%) for surface wind speed and 7 to 24 hPa for central surface pressure. The simulated intensity increases are statistically significant according to most of the statistical tests conducted and are robust to changes in storm initialization methods. Near-storm precipitation is 28% greater in the high CO2 sample. In terms of storm tracks, the high CO2 sample is quite similar to the control. The mean radius of hurricane force winds is 2 to 3% greater for the composite high CO2 storm than for the control, and the high CO2 storms penetrate slightly higher into the upper troposphere. More idealized experiments were also performed in which an initial storm disturbance was embedded in highly simplified flow fields using time mean temperature and moisture conditions from the global climate model. These idealized experiments support the case study results and suggest that, in terms of thermodynamic influences, the results for the NW Pacific basin are qualitatively applicable to other tropical storm basins.",1
"Although we enjoy convenient and happy lives as a result of using large amount of fossil fuels, this convenience comes at a steep price: global warming, pollution, and destruction of the environment. It took more than a hundred million years for the Earth to accumulate its current reserves of fossil fuels. It is sure that the earth will confuse, if we exhaust it within 1-2 centuries. Solar energy supports all life on the earth, and plants are able to use this energy. Annually, plant biomass produces 8 times as much energy as we consume globally. Therefore, if we could harness 12% of plant biomass for the production of energy and industrial materials, in place of fossil fuels, we could establish a sustainable world. Plant biotechnology is progressing rapidly, and research aimed at producing both fuels and plastics from plant biomass is already underway. Because carbon dioxide generated from plant products will ultimately be consumed by other plants, the recycling system is built in. Our future therefore may not so dark after all.",1
"Boreal forest ecosystems are sensitive to global warming, caused by increasing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Assessment of the biological response to future climate change is based mainly on large-scale models. Whole-ecosystem experiments provide one of the few available tools by which ecosystem response can be measured and with which global models can be evaluated. Boreal ecosystem response to global change may be manifest by alterations in nitrogen (N) dynamics, as N is often the growth limiting nutrient. The CLIMEX (Climate Change Experiment) project entails catchment-scale manipulations of CO2 (to 560 ppmv) and temperature (by + 3 to + 5 degrees C) to whole forest ecosystems in southern Norway. Soil temperature is increased at 400-m(2) EGIL catchment by means of electric cables placed on the soil surface. Soil warming at EGIL catchment caused an increase in nitrate and ammonium concentrations in runoff in the first year of treatment. We hypothesize that higher temperature increased N release by mineralization. Whether these responses are only transient will be shown by additional years' treatment.",1
"Global climate change has stimulated efforts to reduce CO(2) emissions. One approach to addressing this problem is to recycle CO(2) directly into fuels or chemicals using photosynthesis. Here we genetically engineered Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to produce isobutyraldehyde and isobutanol directly from CO(2) and increased productivity by overexpression of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Isobutyraldehyde is a precursor for the synthesis of other chemicals, and isobutanol can be used as a gasoline substitute. The high vapor pressure of isobutyraldehyde allows in situ product recovery and reduces product toxicity. The engineered strain remained active for 8 d and produced isobutyraldehyde at a higher rate than those reported for ethanol(1), hydrogen(2) or lipid(3) production by cyanobacteria or algae. These results underscore the promise of direct bioconversion of CO(2) into fuels and chemicals, which bypasses the need for deconstruction of biomass.",1
"This paper is based on the commemorative lecture which was delivered at the award ceremony of the Volvo Environmental Prize. The author describes his early attempt to study the greenhouse effect using a one-dimensional model of radiative, convective equilibrium of the atmosphere. This is followed by the description of a recent study of global warming which employs a general circulation model of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface system developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). In particular, the study attempts to elucidate the role of oceanic and land surface processes in shaping the response of surface air temperature to a gradual increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).",1
"Smokeless biomass pyrolysis for biochar and biofuel production is a possible arsenal for global carbon capture and sequestration at gigatons of carbon (GtC) scales. The United States can annually harvest over 3 Gt (gigaton) of dry biomass. Use of the smokeless (clean and efficient) biomass-pyrolysis technology would enable the United States to converts its 3 Gt of annually harvestable biomass to biochar products equivalent to 325 million tons of stable carbon plus significant amount of biofuels including syngas and bio-oils. Currently, the world could annually harvest more than 6.5 GtC y(-1) of biomass. The 6.5 GtC y(-1) of biomass could be converted to biochar (3.25 GtC y(-1)) and biofuels (with heating value equivalent to that of 6500 million barrels of crude oil). Because biochar is mostly not digestible to microorganisms, a biochar-based soil amendment could serve as a permanent carbon-sequestration agent in soils/subsoil earth layers for thousands of years. By storing 3.25 GtC y(-1) of biochar (equivalent to 19 Gt of CO(2) per year) into soil and/or underground reservoirs alone, it would offset the world's 8.67 GtC y(-1) of fossil fuel CO(2) emissions by about 38%. The worldwide maximum capacity for storing biochar carbon into agricultural soils (1411 million hectares) is estimated to be about 428 GtC. It may be also possible to provide a global carbon ""thermostat"" mechanism by creating biochar carbon energy storage reserves. This biomass-pyrolysis ""carbon-negative"" energy approach merits serious research and development worldwide to help provide clean energy and control global warming for a sustainable future of human civilization on Earth.",1
"A precipitation typing algorithm was applied to climate model simulations in order to investigate the effect of global warming on the occurrence of freezing rain over North America. The model used in the study was the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' CGCM3. Two realizations of the present-day (1981-2000) climate and two realizations of a global warming (2081-2100) simulation were run using scenario A2 from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The algorithm was applied to the four twenty-year periods in order to determine the change in the number and distribution of freezing rain events. The model results indicate that the present-day freezing rain maximum over eastern North America will shift poleward and weaken with the result that freezing rain events will decrease significantly in the eastern United States and the Atlantic Provinces. To the north of the maximum and over central Canada there will be modest increases in freezing rain. When averaged over North America, there will be an overall decrease in freezing rain events with global warming.",1
"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered to be the major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. While reducing fossil fuel consumption may provide the ultimate answer to CO2 emission problems, one of the short-term solutions is the separation and subsequent disposal of the CO2 from power plant and industrial flue gas streams. A novel, energy-efficient CO2 separation process known as the circulating fluidized bed pressure-temperature swing adsorber (CFB-PTSA) is simulated in this work. A hydrodynamic model for the gas and solids flow structure in the riser of circulating fluidized beds is combined with a competitive adsorption model for a carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen mixture on a type X zeolite, as described by the ideal adsorbed solution theory, to predict the reactor performance. Simulations performed at various riser operating conditions and flue gas CO2 concentrations indicate that the CO2 recovery decreases with increasing concentration at a fixed solids circulation Bur, but the purity of the recovered product increases. Recoveries in the range of 65-88.5% and product purities of 75-90% CO2 are predicted.",1
"The response of the ocean's meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to increased greenhouse gas forcing is examined using a coupled model of intermediate complexity, including a dynamic 3-D ocean subcomponent. Parameters are the increase in CO2 forcing (with stabilization after a specified time interval) and the model's climate sensitivity. In this model, the cessation of deep sinking in the north ""Atlantic"" (hereinafter, a ""collapse""), as indicated by changes in the MOC, behaves like a simple bifurcation. The final surface air temperature (SAT) change, which is closely predicted by the product of the radiative forcing and the climate sensitivity, determines whether a collapse occurs. The initial transient response in SAT is largely a function of the forcing increase, with higher sensitivity runs exhibiting delayed behavior; accordingly, high CO2-low sensitivity scenarios can be assessed as a recovering or collapsing circulation shortly after stabilization, whereas low CO2-high sensitivity scenarios require several hundred additional years to make such a determination. We also systemically examine how the rate of forcing, for a given CO2 stabilization, affects the ocean response. In contrast with previous studies based on results using simpler ocean models, we find that except for a narrow range of marginally stable to marginally unstable scenarios, the forcing rate has little impact on whether the run collapses or recovers. In this narrow range, however, forcing increases on a time scale of slow ocean advective processes results in weaker declines in overturning strength and can permit a run to recover that would otherwise collapse.",1
"This paper compares two floor constructions used at the new airport outside Oslo, one made of solid oak and one made of natural stone, to (i) make an inventory of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the life cycle of the two constructions, (ii) calculate the differences regarding GHG emissions and cost, and (iii) determine which factors have the strongest influence on the results. Manufacturing the wood floor required 6 times more energy and produced one-third of the GHG emissions compared with the natural stone floor. Over the life cycle, net GHG emissions can be avoided only if the wood is used as a biofuel after the replacement or demolition of the floor. The wooden floor must be competitive on price to be a cost-efficient action against global warming. Per cubic metre of wood floor, emissions of up to 263 t of CO2 equivalents can be avoided by a substitution between the two floor constructions. The factors that have the most influence on the result are carbon fixation on forest land, waste handling of wood, and discount rate, the latter reflecting the relative importance over time given to a unit of GHG emissions.",1
"The provision of both electrical and mechanical energy services can play a critical role in poverty alleviation for the almost two billion rural users who currently lack access to electricity. Distributed generation using diesel generators remains a common means of electricity provision for rural communities throughout the world. Due to rising fuel costs, the need to address poverty, and consequences of global warming, it is necessary to develop cost efficient means of reducing fossil fuel consumption in isolated diesel microgrids. Based on a case study in Nicaragua, a set of demand and supply side measures are ordered by their annualized costs in order to approximate an energy supply curve. The curve highlights significant opportunities for reducing the costs of delivering energy services while also transitioning to a carbon-free electrical system. In particular, the study demonstrates the significant cost savings resulting from the implementation of conventional metering, efficient residential lighting, and electricity generation using renewable energy sources.

"Results from a global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (GCM) are used to perform the first in a series of studies of the various time and space scales of climate anomalies in an environment of gradually increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) (a linear transient increase of 1% per year in the coupled model). Since observed climate anomaly patterns often are computed as time-averaged differences between two periods, climate-change signals in the coupled model are defined using differences of various averaging intervals between the transient and control integrations. Annual mean surface air temperature differences for several regions show that the Northern Hemisphere warms faster than the Southern Hemisphere and that land areas warm faster than ocean. The high northern latitudes outside the North Atlantic contribute most to global warming but also exhibit great variability, while the high southern latitudes contribute the least. The equatorial tropics warm more slowly than the subtropics due to strong upwelling and mixing in the ocean. The globally averaged surface air temperature trend computed from annual mean differences for years 23-60 is 0.03-degrees-C per year. Projecting this trend to the time of CO2 doubling in year 100 produces a warming of 2.3-degrees-C. By chance, one particular northern winter five-year average geographical difference pattern in the Northern Hemisphere from the coupled model resembles the recent observed pattern of surface temperature and sea-level pressure anomalies. This pattern is not consistent from one five-year period to the next in any season in the model. However, multidecadal averages in the coupled model show that the North Atlantic warms less than the rest of the high northern latitudes, and recent observations may be a manifestation of this phenomenon. Consistent geographic patterns of climate anomalies forced by increased CO2 in the model are more evident with a longer averaging interval. There is also the possibility that the CO2 climate-change signal may itself be a function of time and space. The general pattern of zonal mean temperature anomalies for all periods in the model shows warming in the troposphere and cooling in the stratosphere. This pattern (or one similar to it taking into account the rest of the trace gases) could be looked for in observations to verify the enhanced greenhouse effect. A zonal mean pattern, however, could prove scientifically satisfactory but of little value to policymakers seeking regional climate-change forecasts. These results from the coupled model underscore the difficulty in identifying a time- and space-dependent ''fingerprint' of greenhouse warming that has some practical use from short climatic records and point to the need to understand the mechanisms of decadal-scale variability.",1
"Due to the growing concern for global warming, the EU25 have implemented the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). In the first trading period (2005-2007), part of the targeted GHG emission reductions presumably will have to result from a switch from coal fired electricity generation to gas fired electricity generation. It is possible to calculate the allowance cost necessary to switch a certain coal fired plant with a certain gas fired plant in the merit order. The allowance cost obtained is a so called switching point. When comparing historic European Union Allowance (EUA) prices (2005) with the corresponding historic switching points, the EUA prices were found high enough to cause a certain switch in the summer season. This finding leads to the use of switching points in establishing allowance cost profiles for several scenarios. A variable gas price profile is used in the simulation tool E-Simulate to simulate electricity generation and related GHG emissions in an eight zonal model representing Western Europe. Several GHG allowance cost profile scenarios are examined. For each scenario, electricity generation in the considered countries is clarified. The focus however lies on the GHG emission reduction potentials. These potentials are addressed for each scenario. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Three experiments starting from different initial conditions have been made with the ECHAM-4 atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM) integrated at T30 resolution forced with the observed sea-surface temperature (SST) over the period 1960-1994. The tropical America modes of seasonal rainfall anomalies whose time variation is most accurately simulated by the GCM have been searched for using Singular Value Decomposition Analyses (SVDA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) between observed and model fields. The leading modes revealed by SVDA and CCA are highly similar, even though the ordering of the modes showed some fluctuation. A first skilful rainfall anomaly mode has weights of the same sign almost everywhere in tropical America. except along the western coast and the sub-tropical margins. This mode appears in all of the four seasons assessed. A second major skilful mode is usually a bipolar north-south (N-S) rainfall anomaly pattern (clear in December-March, DJFM: March-May, MAM, and June-September. JJAS). A large portion of the skill of the first rainfall anomaly mode (same sign anomalies across tropical America except small patches along the western coast) is through variance that is in common with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). In addition to forcing from the central/eastern tropical Pacific SST. there also appears a contribution from contrasting SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic. This rainfall mode is usually a regional portion of a more large-scale mode encompassing at least the whole tropical zone (especially in DJFM, MAM and September-November. SON). Analysis of the relationship of this mode with GCM circulation features reveals that a rainfall deficit (respectively excedent) over the main rainbelt of the tropical America region is associated with strengthening (respectively weakening) of the sub-tropical westerly jet streams, a global warming (respectively cooling) of the tropical atmosphere. an anomalous divergence (respectively convergence) in the lower levels and an anomalous convergence (respectively divergence) in the upper levels over tropical America and in the region of the Atlantic Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Such global features are not so apparent for the dominant mode of JJAS. even though the correlations with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicators (as SOI or NINO3 SST index) are as high as for the other seasons. The bipolar N-S rainfall anomaly mode in tropical America is mostly related to anomalous N-S gradient of SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic. The atmospheric circulation anomalies emphasize changes in 850 hPa meridional winds in the tropical Atlantic. However, there is also interannual variance of this rainfall mode in both the model and observations that is unexplained by tropical Atlantic SSTs, but which is explained by central/eastern tropical Pacific SSTs and, potentially, SSTs from other tropical and extratropical areas. This is especially true in MAM. Some differences in the details of the model and observed teleconnection patterns are noted. Such differences can be used to statistically adjust the model simulations using the CCA or SVDA modes as basis patterns. Both statistical approaches have been applied and the results are consistent between the two, The increase of skill is stronger when temporal correlation (the pattern correlation) between the model and observed pattern is high (low) as for JJAS. The skill is moderate to high around the whole Amazon basin. but remains relatively low inside the Amazon basin, though reliability of the observations themselves may influence this result. Averaged over all the seasons, about 15-35% (35-55%) of the interannual grid-box (regional) seasonal rainfall variance is skilfully simulated from the observed SST forcing.

"The environmental impact of an extended property close source-separation system for solid household waste (i.e. a systems for collection of recyclables from domestic properties) is investigated in a residential area in southern Sweden. Since 2001, households have been able to source-separate waste into six fractions of dry recyclables and food waste sorting. The current system was evaluated using the EASEWASTE life cycle assessment tool. Current status is compared with an ideal scenario in which households display perfect source-separation behaviour and a scenario without any material recycling. Results show that current recycling provides substantial environmental benefits compared to a non-recycling alternative. The environmental benefit varies greatly between recyclable fractions, and the recyclables currently most frequently source-separated by households are often not the most beneficial from an environmental perspective. With optimal source-separation of all recyclables, the current net contribution to global warming could be changed to a net-avoidance while current avoidance of nutrient enrichment, acidification and photochemical ozone formation could be doubled. Sensitivity analyses show that the type of energy substituted by incineration of non-recycled waste, as well as energy used in recycling processes and in the production of materials substituted by waste recycling, is of high relevance for the attained results.",1
"Personal travel is an increasingly important aspect of European society. Our demand for travel, in terms of time, money and mobility, is steadily increasing. This growth has led to a number of undesirable effects, including a substantial contribution to global warming through the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2). To address this issue, a number of solutions are available. Already the technology is established for highly economical cars, but experience shows that incentives or regulations are required in order to stimulate widespread interest in saving fuel. Similarly. alternative fuels can offer considerable reductions in greenhouse emissions, depending on the source of the energy. In the longer run, it is essential that technological measures are complemented by policies to reduce the need to travel, whilst still maintaining accessibility. This paper presents a list of policies that are being investigated as pan of a strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from personal travel in Britain.",1
"China's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion had increased with an annual growth rate of 4.36% since 1980, hitting 1 GtC in 2003. The global climate change issue is becoming more and more important and hence to be the fourth challenge for China's future energy development, following energy supply shortages, energy security, and local environmental protection. This paper used three MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) family models, that is, MARKAL, MARKAL-ED (MARKAL with elastic demand), and MARKAL-MACRO, to study China energy system's carbon mitigation strategies and corresponding impacts on the economy. The models' structures and the economic feedback formulations used in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED are briefly described. The endogenous demands in MARKAL-MACRO and MARKAL-ED enable them to partly satisfy carbon abatement constraints via energy service demand reductions, and the reduction levels for the 30 demand sectors from these two kinds of models for given carbon emission constraints are presented and compared. The impact of carbon mitigation on social welfare from MARKAL and MARKAL-ED, and on GDP, investment and consumption from MARKAL-MACRO are evaluated. The changes in both final and primary energy mix, changes in technology development, as well as marginal abatement costs for given carbon constraints from the three models, are analyzed.

"There is strong scientific evidence that energy consumption and production are often related to greenhouse emissions. It has been argued that the cost of taking smart, effective cooperative action towards reducing global warming should be manageable. Following an effective approach, our work investigates the scenario of environmental sustainability in Malaysia and reassesses energy policy and alternative energy sources such as the utilization of oil palm (that is as a source of renewable energy) to reduce the economic and environmental burden. Our efforts try to lessen the gap between greenhouse gas mitigation and sustainable development, focusing on changing conventional energy instruments. This paper may be useful in the formulation of policies on renewable energy in Malaysia and possibly elsewhere.",1
"Changes in the seasonal CO2 flux of the boreal forests may result from increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and associated global warming patterns. To monitor this potential change, a combination of information derived from remote sensing data, including forest type and growing season length, and ecophysiological models which predict the CO2 fluX and its seasonal amplitude based on meteorological data, are required. In this paper we address the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to map forest type and monitor canopy and soil freeze/thaw, which define the growing season for conifers, and leaf on/off, which defines the growing season for deciduous species. Aircraft SAR (AIRSAR) data collected in March 1988 during a freeze/thaw event are used to generate species maps and to determine the sensitivity of SAR to canopy freeze/thaw transitions. These data are also used to validate a microwave scattering model which is then used to determine the sensitivity of SAR to leaf on/off transitions and soil freeze/thaw. Finally, a CO2, flux algorithm is presented which utilizes SAR data and an ecophysiological model to estimate CO2 flux. CO2 flux MaPS are generated, from which areal estimates Of CO2 flux are derived.",1
"The conversion of native forests by cutting and burning into farming areas leads to alterations in the dynamics of soil organic matter, with changes in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO2, CH4 and N2O) from the biosphere to the atmosphere. These cause an average temperature rise and, consequently, global climate change. The aim of this study was to examine relationships between the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O with moisture, microbial biomass and inorganic N forms in soil with different land uses in the Cerrado biome (Rio Verde county, State of Goias - Brazil). The climate (Koppen-Geiger) was classified as Aw and the soil as Latossolo Vermelho distrofico caulinitico I a clayey kaolinitic Oxisol under original Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) vegetation. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) with four treatments (areas): Native vegetation - Cerrado (CE); brachiaria pasture (PA); soybean in conventional tillage (SC) and no-tillage (NT) corn followed by millet. No significant differences in annual CO2 and N2O emissions were observed between treatments. This can be explained by the variability of gas fluxes due to climate seasonality, with lower emissions in the winter due to low soil moisture. Mean emissions of CO2 were 108.9 +/- 85.6 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and N2O 13.5 +/- 7.6 mu g m(-2) h(-1). For CH4 significant differences in the fluxes were only observed in pasture (32 mu g m(-2) h(-1)), while in the other areas inflows between 46 and 15 mu g m(-2) h(-1) were observed. The GHG fluxes showed close correlation with soil moisture. The N-NO3- emissions were significantly correlated with CO2-emissions in all areas. Considering all treatments together, the three GHG fluxes were correlated with the microbial C and N contents. However, the Cmicro: Nmicro ratio was not significantly correlated with the GHG flux. Only for pasture the CO2 and N2O fluxes were correlated with the content of soil inorganic-N. Results suggested that the GHG fluxes in the Cerrado are related to rainfall, mainly in farming areas treated with high fertilizer closes to increase productivity.",1
"The environmental assessment of deep geologic disposal of Canadian nuclear fuel waste considers many processes that could affect radionuclide transport to humans over thousands of years. Climatic change is an important feature that will occur over these long times. Glaciation will likely occur within the next 100,000 years over much of Canada, and its impact on radiological doses has been assessed previously. In the present study, we investigate the potential effect of shortterm climatic change, usually associated with global warming caused by increases in atmospheric trace gases. We study the main biosphere transport pathways causing a radiological dose to humans from I-129, which is the most important radionuclide in disposal of Canadian used nuclear fuel. Irrigation of a garden with contaminated well water is the main pathway and it can be affected by changes in temperature and precipitation. A cold, wet climate decreases the need for irrigation, and this decreases the radiological dose. A drastic climatic change, such as an increase in temperature from 10 to 20 degrees C and decrease in precipitation from 0.3 to 0.2 m during the growing season, is estimated to increase the dose by a factor of four. This is a relatively small change compared to the range of doses that arise from the variability and uncertainty in many of the parameters used in the environmental assessment models. Therefore, it is likely that the results of probabilistic dose assessment models can include the consequences of short-term climatic change.",1
"An increase in concentration of atmospheric CO2 is one major factor influencing global climate change. Among the consequences of such an increase is the stimulation of plant growth and productivity. Below-ground microbial processes are also likely to be affected indirectly by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, through increased root growth and rhizodeposition rates. Because changes in microbial community composition might have an impact on symbiotic interactions with plants, the response of root nodule symbionts to elevated atmospheric CO2 was investigated. In this study we determined the genetic structure of 120 Rhizobium leguminosarum by, trifolii isolates from white clover plants exposed to ambient (350 mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (600 mu mol-mol(-1)) atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the Swiss FACE (Free-Air-Carbon-Dioxide-Enrichment) facility. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) fingerprinting of genomic DNA showed that the isolates from plants grown under elevated CO2 were genetically different from those isolates obtained from plants grown under ambient conditions. Moreover, there was a 17% increase in nodule occupancy under conditions of elevated atmospheric CO2 when strains of R. leguminosarum by. trifolii isolated from plots exposed to CO2 enrichment were evaluated for their ability to compete for nodulation with those strains isolated from ambient conditions. These results indicate that a shift in the community composition of R. leguminosarum by. trifolii occurred as a result of an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, and that elevated atmospheric CO2 affects the competitive ability of root nodule symbionts, most likely leading to a selection of these particular strains to nodulate white clover.",1
"Waste management activities contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions approximately by 4%. In particular the disposal of waste in landfills generates methane that has high global warming potential. Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is important and could provide environmental benefits and sustainable development, as well as reduce adverse impacts on public health. The European and UK waste policy force sustainable waste management and especially diversion from landfill, through reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, and recovery of value from waste. Energy from waste is a waste management option that could provide diversion from landfill and at the same time save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, since it recovers energy from waste which usually replaces an equivalent amount of energy generated from fossil fuels. Energy from waste is a wide definition and includes technologies such as incineration of waste with energy recovery, or combustion of waste-derived fuels for energy production or advanced thermal treatment of waste with technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis, with energy recovery. The present study assessed the greenhouse gas emission impacts of three technologies that could be used for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in order to recover energy from it. These technologies are Mass Burn Incineration with energy recovery, Mechanical Biological Treatment via bio-drying and Mechanical Heat Treatment, which is a relatively new and uninvestigated method, compared to the other two. Mechanical Biological Treatment and Mechanical Heat Treatment can turn Municipal Solid Waste into Solid Recovered Fuel that could be combusted for energy production or replace other fuels in various industrial processes. The analysis showed that performance of these two technologies depends strongly on the final use of the produced fuel and they could produce GHG emissions savings only when there is end market for the fuel. On the other hand Mass Burn Incineration generates greenhouse gas emission savings when it recovers electricity and heat. Moreover the study found that the expected increase on the amount of Municipal Solid Waste treated for energy recovery in England by 2020 could save greenhouse gas emission, if certain Energy from Waste technologies would be applied, under certain conditions.

"In addition to influencing climatic conditions directly through radiative forcing, increasing carbon dioxide concentration influences the climate system through its effects on plant physiology(1). Plant stomata generally open less widely under increased carbon dioxide concentration(2), which reduces transpiration(1,3-6) and thus leaves more water at the land surface(7). This driver of change in the climate system, which we term 'physiological forcing', has been detected in observational records of increasing average continental runoff over the twentieth century(8). Here we use an ensemble of experiments with a global climate model that includes a vegetation component to assess the contribution of physiological forcing to future changes in continental runoff, in the context of uncertainties in future precipitation. We find that the physiological effect of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations on plant transpiration increases simulated global mean runoff by 6 per cent relative to pre-industrial levels; an increase that is comparable to that simulated in response to radiatively forced climate change (11 +/- 6 per cent). Assessments of the effect of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations on the hydrological cycle that only consider radiative forcing(9-11) will therefore tend to underestimate future increases in runoff and overestimate decreases. This suggests that freshwater resources may be less limited than previously assumed under scenarios of future global warming, although there is still an increased risk of drought. Moreover, our results highlight that the practice of assessing the climate-forcing potential of all greenhouse gases in terms of their radiative forcing potential relative to carbon dioxide does not accurately reflect the relative effects of different greenhouse gases on freshwater resources.",1
"This paper tests the hypothesis that continental chemical weathering increased during the initial Eocene thermal maximum (IETM) by comparing paleosols that formed before and during the event in western Texas. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) was used to investigate the weathering of silicate minerals. Paleosols generated before the IETM have CIA values ranging from 62 to 72, and CIA values during the IETM range from 67 to 82. The CIA values for pre-initial Eocene thermal maximum paleosols indicate moderate weathering conditions, and CIA values during the event indicate moderate to extreme weathering conditions. The clay mineralogy of the paleosols is dominated by smectite, and it is only within paleosols that formed during the IETM that there is a change. There is a notable increase in the amount of kaolinite in one paleosol horizon that is associated with the carbon excursion. In addition, there is an increase in the translocation of clays and iron, and an increase in the leaching of calcite and plagioclase in initial Eocene thermal maximum paleosols. The differences between soils that formed before and during the initial Eocene thermal maximum indicate that chemical weathering did increase during this ancient global warming event. The mechanism responsible for increased weathering is interpreted to be an increase in hydrolysis reactions caused by an increase in humidity and an increase of carbonic acid in the soil due to elevated CO2 levels during the initial Eocene thermal maximum. Documentation of an increase in chemical weathering during the initial Eocene thermal maximum is significant because it may have served as a negative feedback to reduce atmospheric CO2.",1
"Under the pressure of global warming, it is imperative for Chinese government to impose effective policy instruments to promote domestic energy saving and carbon emissions reduction. As one of the most important incentive-based policy instruments, carbon tax has sparked a lively controversy in China. This paper explores the impact of carbon tax on Chinese economy, as well as the cushion effects of the complementary policies, by constructing a dynamic recursive general equilibrium model. The model can describe the new equilibrium for each sequential independent period (e.g. one year) after carbon tax and the complementary policies are imposed, and thus describe the long-term impacts of the policies. The simulation results show that carbon tax is an effective policy tool because it can reduce carbon emissions with a little negative impact on economic growth; reducing indirect tax in the meantime of imposing carbon tax will help to reduce the negative impact of the tax on production and competitiveness: in addition, giving households subsidy in the meantime will help to stimulate household consumptions. Therefore, complementary policies used together with carbon tax will help to cushion the negative impacts of carbon tax on the economy. The dynamic CGE analysis shows the impact of carbon tax policy on the GDP is relatively small, but the reduction of carbon emission is relatively large. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Freshwater discharge is one main element of the hydrological cycle that physically and biogeochemically connects the atmosphere, land surface, and ocean and directly responds to changes in pCO(2). Nevertheless, while the effect of near-future global warming on total river runoff has been intensively studied, little attention has been given to longer-term impacts and thresholds of increasing pCO(2) on changes in the partitioning of surface and subsurface flow paths across broad climate zones. These flow paths and their regional responses have a significant role for vegetation, soils, and nutrient leaching and transport. We present climate simulations for modern, near-future (850 ppm), far-future (1880 ppm), and past Late Cretaceous (1880 ppm) pCO(2) levels. The results show large zonal mean differences and the displacement of flows from the surface to the subsurface depending on the respective pCO(2) level. At modern levels the ratio of deeper subsurface to near-surface flows for tropical and high northern latitudes is 1:4.0 and 1:0.5, respectively, reflecting the contrast between permeable tropical soils and the areas of frozen ground in high latitudes. There is a trend toward increased total flow in both climate zones at 850 ppm, modeled to be increases in the total flow of 34 and 51%, respectively, with both zones also showing modest increases in the proportion of subsurface flow. Beyond 850 ppm the simulations show a distinct divergence of hydrological trends between mid- to high northern latitudes and tropical zones. While total wetting reverses in the tropics beyond 850 ppm due to reduced precipitation, with average zonal total runoff decreasing by 46% compared to the 850 ppm simulation, the high northern latitude zone becomes slightly wetter with the average zonal total runoff increasing by a further 3%. The ratio of subsurface to surface flows in the tropics remains at a level similar to the present day, but in the high northern latitude zone the ratio increases significantly to 1:6 due to the loss of frozen ground. The results for the high pCO(2) simulations with the same uniform soil and vegetation cover as the Cretaceous are comparable to the results for the Cretaceous simulation, with higher fractions of subsurface flow of 1:5.4 and 1:5.6, respectively for the tropics, and 1:2.2 and 1:6, respectively for the high northern latitudes. We suggest that these fundamental similarities between our far future and Late Cretaceous models provide a framework of possible analogous consequences for (far-) future climate change, within which the integrated human impact over the next centuries could be assessed. The results from this modeling study are consistent with climate information from the sedimentary record which highlights the crucial role of terrestrial-marine interactions during past climate change. This study points to profound consequences for soil biogeochemical cycling, with different latitudinal expressions, passing of climate thresholds at elevated pCO(2) levels, and enhanced export of nutrients to the ocean at higher pCO(2).",1
"In 1998, NASA launches EOS-AM1, the first of a series of the Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites. EOS will monitor the evolution of the state of the earth for 18 years, starting with the morning observations of EOS-AM1 (10:30 a.m. equatorial crossing time). An integrated view of the earth, as planned by EOS, is needed to study the interchange of energy, moisture, and carbon between the lands, oceans, and atmosphere. The launch of EOS-AM1 and other international satellites marks a new phase of climate and global change research. Both natural and anthropogenic climate change have been studied for more than a century. It is now recognized that processes that vary rapidly in time and space-e.g, aerosol, clouds, land use, and exchanges of energy and moisture-must be considered to adequately explain the temperature record and predict future climate change. Frequent measurements with adequate resolution, as only possible from spacecraft, are key tools in such an effort. The versatile and highly accurate EOS-AM1 data, together with previous satellite records, as well as data from the Advanced Earth Observing System (ADEOS) (I and II), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), EOS-PM1, Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat), and ground-based networks is expected to revolutionize the way scientists look at climate change. This article introduces the EOS-AM1 mission and the special issue devoted to it. Following a brief historical perspective for an insight into the purpose and objectives of the mission, we shall summarize the characteristics of the five instruments onboard EOS-AM Specifically, we concentrate on the innovative elements of these five instruments and provide examples of the science issues that require this type of data. These examples show the importance of collecting data simultaneously from each of the five EOS-AM1 sensors for studying rapidly varying processes and parameters.",1
"The problem of global warming illustrates the serious interrelationship between the production of energy and environmental concerns. As part of the survey on the effective use of carbon dioxide, taking the global environment into consideration, a study was carried out on the application Of CO2 in EOR as a countermeasure to global warming. This paper studies the feasibility of a total system for the stabilization of CO2 using EOR. This system involves separation and recovery Of CO2 from fixed sources in Japan, liquefaction and transportation to the oil-fields in oil producing countries, injection to the reservoir and eventual recovery and recycling. Utilization of CO2 for EOR therefore, not only increases oil production but also results in the stabilization of CO2, thus preventing further global warming.",1
"Does climate determine species' ranges? Rapid rates of anthropogenic warming make this classic ecological question especially relevant. We ask whether climate controls range limits by quantifying relationships between climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) and tree growth across the altitudinal ranges of six Pacific Northwestern conifers on Mt. Rainier, Washington, USA. Results for three species (Abies amabilis, Callitropsis nootkatensis, Tsuga mertensiana) whose upper limits occur at treeline (>1600 m) imply climatic controls on upper range limits, with low growth in cold and high snowpack years. Annual growth was synchronized among individuals at upper limits for these high-elevation species, further suggesting that stand-level effects such as climate constrain growth more strongly than local processes. By contrast, at lower limits climatic effects on growth were weak for these high-elevation species. Growth-climate relationships for three low-elevation species (Pseudotsuga menziesii, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla) were not consistent with expectations of climatic controls on upper limits, which are located within closed-canopy forest (<1200 m). Annual growth of these species was poorly synchronized among individuals. Our results suggest that climate controls altitudinal range limits at treeline, while local drivers (perhaps biotic interactions) influence growth in closed-canopy forests. Climate-change-induced range shifts in closed-canopy forests will therefore be difficult to predict accurately.",1
"Past and future trend of electricity use for air conditioning in the entire commercial sector in subtropical climates using 1979-2008 measured meteorological data as well as predictions for 2009-2100 from a general circulation model (MIROC3.2-H) was investigated. Air conditioning consumption showed an increasing trend over the past 30 years from 1979 to 2008. Principal component analysis (PCA) of measured and predicted monthly mean dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature and global solar radiation was conducted to determine a new climatic index Z for 1979-2008 and future 92 years (2009-2100) based on two emissions scenarios B1 and A1B (low and medium forcing). Through regression analysis, electricity use in air conditioning for the 92-year period was estimated. For low forcing, average consumption in 2009-2038, 2039-2068 and 2069-2100 would be, respectively, 5.7%, 12.8% and 18.4% more than the 1979-2008 average, with a mean 12.5% increase for the entire 92-year period. Medium forcing showed a similar increasing trend, but 1-4% more. Standard deviations of the monthly air conditioning consumption were found to be smaller suggesting possible reduction in seasonal variations in future years. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"A two-dimensional global climate model is used to assess the climatic changes associated with the new IPCC SRES emissions scenarios and to determine which kind of changes in total solar irradiance and volcanic perturbations could mask the projected anthropogenic global warming associated to the SRES scenarios. Our results suggest that only extremely unlikely changes in total solar irradiance and/or volcanic eruptions would be able to overcome the simulated anthropogenic global warming over the century. Nevertheless, in the critical interval of the next two decades the externally-driven natural climate variability might possibly confuse the debate about temperature trends and impede detection of the anthropogenic climate change signal.",1
"The natural cycle of plant and animal life involves recycling materials through the open environment. Thus carbon dioxide and many waste substances are released to the soil or atmosphere and returned to be taken up by plants. Modern agriculture has intensified the production of many substances, with unwanted effects on the atmosphere (including global warming and acid rain), water and soil. Moreover, because most drops are grown as monoculture, competing plants, and pests and diseases, are controlled through a wide range of agrochemicals which also affect the environment; herbicides remain a major case of drinking water failing to meet the required standards. A 'clean technology' approach is urgently needed, and current research is showing the way. Research on the nitrogen cycle indicates, for example, that nitrogen losses from intensive dairy production can be reduced by up to 70%; however, changes to the whole farm system are needed to achieve results. Both engineering and biological approaches offer ways of reducing pesticide use; we can use computer control and decision support to improve the precision with which chemicals are applied; we can seek new understanding of chemical-insect-plant interactions which allow new control techniques (such as semiochemicals, which influence insect behaviour) to be derived. Agriculture can also provide a sustainable source of clean energy and could also supply industrial products such as oils and fibres, reducing our dependence on petrochemicals.",1
"The key scientific uncertainty in the global warming debate is the equilibrium climate sensitivity. Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models predict a wide range of equilibrium climate sensitivities, with a consequently large spread of societal implications. Comparison of models with instrumental data has not been able to reduce the uncertainty in climate sensitivity. An alternative way to gauge equilibrium climate sensitivity is to use paleoclimatic data. Two recent advances, the development and application of proxy recorders of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) and the synchronization of the deep-sea and Antarctic ice-core time scales, make it possible to directly relate past changes in tropical SST to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The strong correspondence of a proxy SST record from the eastern equatorial Pacific and the Vostok CO2 record suggests that varying atmospheric carbon dioxide is the dominant control on tropical climate on orbital time scales. This effect is especially pronounced at the 100 000-yr cycle. Calibration of the CO2 influence via tropical SST variability indicates a tropical climate sensitivity of 4.4degrees-5.6degreesC ( errors estimated at +/-0degreesC) for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This result suggests that the equilibrium response of tropical climate to atmospheric CO2 changes is likely to be similar to the upper end of available global predictions from coupled models.",1
"The Action Program of Japan to arrest global warming was announced on October of 1990. As a core research organization for the purpose of tackling the growing threat the global environment problems, the research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) was established. In Japan many national laboratories, universities and private companies research new technologies and develop new processes for mitigating global warming. The present status of the research and development on CO2 removal and disposal technologies in Japan is described.",1
"Greenhouse gas (GHG; mainly CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O, CFC-11 and CFC-12) measurements for 22 years (1983-2004) have been analysed to evaluate the radiative forcing (RF) and temporal evolution at the South Pole. About 20% increase in growth rate of CO(2) has been observed during 1992-2004 compared to 1983-9 However, remarkable deceleration in the growth rate of CH4, CFC-11 and CFC-12 has been observed. CO2 radiative forcing has increased by similar to 49% during 2004 for 10% increase in CO(2) concentration during the last 22 years. RF due to CH(4) was found to be 0.47 W m(-2) in 1999 and since then has remained almost constant through 2004. The net RF has been observed to increase by 0.7 W m(-2) during 2004 compared to 1983, which corresponds to similar to 38% increase in the last 22 years. Growth rate of net RF decreased by similar to 22% during 1990-2004, compared to the growth rate during 1983-90. A global warming simulation made using the EdGCM model shows an increase in surface air temperature and sea surface temperature of about 7 degrees C and 1 degrees C respectively, in 2050 compared to 1958. In response to change in GHGs from 1958 to 2050, warming over the higher latitudes is greater than in the tropics and also increase in minimum temperature is greater than the increase in maximum temperature. Similarly, up to 50% change in snow-ice cover over some of the regions in the higher latitudes is observed with this simulation.",1
"Adaption of technologies for energy production with improved environmental performance is essential for supporting world economic growth and managing the global warming and climate change issues. International cooperation is critical to ensure the environmental and energy security of world economies on a global basis. For example, the USA has acquired a great deal of useful experience in clean coal technology, which has been demonstrated with major utilities in commercial operations. The adoption and installation of clean coal technology should be given high priority worldwide. The continuous exchange of information and technology between developed and developing economies relating to current and fut4f great importance. Developed economies that possess environmentally responsive technologies and financial resources should work closely with developing economies to facilitate technology transfer and trade of technologies. Cooperation between economies can result in lowering the cast of deploying clean coal technologies directed toward the clean production of energy. This paper discusses a bilateral approach, i.e. the US/China Center for Energy and Environment, Co facilitate the mitigation of emissions and promote the clean use of coal to satisfy growing energy demand in developing economies.",1
"One-year-old oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch.) seedlings were grown in growth chambers for 30 days to investigate the effects of the combination of elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2], 700 mu mol/mol) and temperature (ambient T + 4 degrees C) and only elevated temperature (ambient T +4 degrees C) on leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and chlorophyll content. In the growth chambers, natural conditions of the Maoershan mountain regions of Heilongjiang Province (45-46 degrees N, 127-128 degrees E) of China for the average growth season were simulated. The results showed that the maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-Nmax) was approximate to 64 times greater at elevated temperature than at ambient temperature. The irradiance saturation point (I-s), apparent quantum yield (AQY), maximum photosystem II efficiency (F-v/F-m), and chlorophyll content significantly increased, while irradiance compensation point (I (c)) was not affected by elevated temperature. The combination of elevated [CO2] and temperature also significantly increased P-Nmax by approximately 34% but much lower than that under elevated temperature only. In the case of factor combination, dark respiration (R-d), I-c, F-v/F-m, and total chlorophyll content increased significantly, while I-s and AQY were not affected. Moreover, under elevated [CO2] and temperature, R-d and I-c, F-v/F-m were significantly higher than under elevated temperature only. The results indicated that the combination of elevated [CO2] and temperature expected in connection with the further global climate change may affect carbon storage of the coenotype of Q. mongolica in this region of China.",1
"Depending on management, forests can be an important sink or source of carbon that if released as CO(2) could contribute to global warming. Many forests in the western United States are being treated to reduce fuels, yet the effects of these treatments on forest carbon are not well understood. We compared the immediate effects of fuels treatments on carbon stocks and releases in replicated plots before and after treatment, and against a reconstruction of active-fire stand conditions for the same forest in 1865. Total live-tree carbon was substantially lower in modern fire-suppressed conditions (and all of the treatments) than the same forest under an active-fire regime. Although fire suppression has increased stem density, current forests have fewer very large trees, reducing total live-tree carbon stocks and shifting a higher proportion of those stocks into small-diameter, fire-sensitive trees. Prescribed burning released 14.8 Mg C/ha, with pre-burn thinning increasing the average release by 70% and contributing 29-37.5 Mg C/ha in milling waste. Fire suppression may have incurred a double carbon penalty by reducing stocks and contributing to emissions with fuels-treatment activities or inevitable wildfire combustion. All treatments reduced fuels and increased fire resistance, but most of the gains were achieved with understory thinning, with only modest increases in the much heavier overstory thinning. We suggest modifying current treatments to focus on reducing surface fuels, actively thinning the majority of small trees, and removing only fire-sensitive species in the merchantable, intermediate size class. These changes would retain most of the current carbon-pool levels, reduce prescribed burn and potential future wildfire emissions, and favor stand development of large, fire-resistant trees that can better stabilize carbon stocks.",1
"There is widespread and growing international concern about global climate change resulting from greenhouse effect. CO(2) removal from natural gas gives one of the solutions to reduce emissions from the gas-based power plants. Partial oxidation of natural gas with the presence of steam and restricted air produces carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This carbon monoxide can be converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, in the presence of steam in a shift reactor. Carbon dioxide is absorbed before gas turbine combustion from the products of the shift reactor. The resulting fuel for combustion mainly consists of hydrogen and nitrogen, thus combustion (e. g. in a gas turbine) exhaust is virtually devoid of CO(2). The paper discusses the selection of some important parameters necessary to obtain a maximum level of conversion of hydrogen from natural gas in the partial oxidation reactor. The parameters which influence the hydrogen production are air-to-methane ratio, steam-to-methane ratio and reactor pressure. The results showed that a net efficiency of 43%, with a 95.5% of fuel conversion can be obtained by combined cycle with dual pressure heat recovery steam generator based on present technological status.

"The concept of carbon credit arose out of increasing awareness of the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat global warming which was formalized in the Kyoto protocol. In addition to contribution to sustainable development with energy recovery in the form of methane, carbon credits can be claimed by application of advanced anaerobic processes in wastewater treatment for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. As anaerobic granular systems are capable of handling high organic loadings concomitant with high strength wastewater and short hydraulic retention time, they could render much more carbon credits than other conventional anaerobic systems. This study investigated the potential carbon credit derived from laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors based on a carbon balance analysis. Methane emission reduction could be calculated by calculating the difference of UASB reactors and open lagoon treatment systems. Based on the 2.5 l bench-scale reactor, the total CH(4) emissions reduction was calculated as 29 kg CO(2)/year. On scaling up to a typical full-scale anaerobic digester, the total CH(4) emissions reduction could achieve 46,420 tons CO(2) reduction/year. The estimated carbon credits would amount to 278,500 US$ per year by assuming a carbon price of 6 US$ per metric ton CO(2) reduction. The analysis postulated that it is financially viable to invest in advanced anaerobic granular treatment system from the revenue generated from carbon credits. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"The leading cause of climate change today is the burning of fossil fuels related to energy production. One approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, therefore, is to more actively switch to renewable technologies in the production of electricity, and reduce the use of fossil fuels in electricity production. This is the goal of renewable portfolio standard (RPS) legislation, currently in effect in 28 states across the country. In this paper we discuss the potential for water power development as one method to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions. We look at the potential from (1) new small/micro hydropower dams, (2) uprating facilities at existing large hydropower dams, (3) new generating facilities at existing non-hydropower dams, and (4) hydrokinetics. We analyze this potential by type, by state, and by its ability to satisfy current RPS goals. Finally, we consider the cost-effectiveness of developing these sources of water-based energy. We find that while water power will never be the complete answer to emissions-free energy production, a strong case can be made that it can be a useful part of the answer. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Methane is an important climate gas contributing significantly to global warming. A large part of the anthropogenic emissions of methane comes from landfills. Due to the biogenic origin of these emissions and the inhomogeneous characteristics of landfills and their soil cover, these emissions show large spatial variation. Thus, development of reliable and cost-effective methods for measurements of these emissions is an important task and a challenge to the scientific community. Traditionally, field chamber methods have been used but also different area integrating methods based on downwind plume measurements. These measurements have been supported by meteorological data either directly from local measurements or by controlled release of tracer gas from the landfill providing the dispersion characteristics of the plume. in this paper we describe a method, the Time Correlation Tracer method, combining controlled tracer gas release from the landfill with time-resolved concentration measurements downwind the landfill using FTIR absorption spectroscopy. The method has been tested and used on measurements at a landfill in southern Sweden over the past 5 years. The method has proven to be a usable method for measurements of total methane emission from landfills, and under favorable meteorological conditions we estimate an achievable accuracy of 15-30%. The real time analysis capability of the FTIR makes it possible to judge the success of the measurement already on site and to decide whether more measurements are necessary. The measurement strategy is relatively simple and straightforward, and one person can make a measurement from a medium sized landfill (1-4 ha) within a few days to a week depending on the meteorological situation.",1
"The robustness of the atmospheric circulation response to global warming in a set of atmospheric general circulation models ( AGCMs) is investigated. The global-warmed climate is forced by a global pattern of warmed ocean surface temperatures that is extracted from a multi-model ensemble of coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model greenhouse warming simulations. The robustness of the warming response is evaluated by a hierarchical set of comparisons. The warming response is compared first between two independently developed AGCMs, then as a function of horizontal resolution in one model, and finally as a function of a single tuning parameter, related to orographic gravity wave drag. Across these levels of comparison, the tropical and subtropical response is generally robust in zonal wind and temperature, but the extratropical response is non-robust. On regional scales, almost every aspect of the response is non-robust, even to the variation of a single tuning parameter. Some evidence is presented that the non-robustness of the simulated response to global warming might be predicted from the ( non global-warmed) control simulation.",1
"High energy prices and an established awareness of the anthropogenic origin of global warming are stimulating markets and policymakers to move toward a much higher utilization of biomass fuels for energy conversion. In order to develop efficient processes, though, much research is still needed to characterize the behavior of Such alternative fuels. Ill this paper the pyrolysis of some agro-residues, abundant ill Europe, was studied in a TG-FTIR setup. In order to remove from the samples the alkali metals and Cl which are detrimental for process operation, causing slagging, fouling, and loss of fluidization, a water leaching pretreatment was applied to all the samples. The thermogravimetric curve of wheat straw showed a singular peak at 324 degrees C and a residue of 26 wt % ar. The leaching pretreatment increased the temperature or reaction up to 355 degrees C and the weight loss to 83.3 wt % ar. The olive residue sample also showed all increase in reacting temperature and volatile release. The peach sample, probably due to its different composition, reacted over two very distinct peaks at 287 and 359 degrees C. The leaching procedure did not affect this sample oil the temperatures of reaction, while it slightly increased the amount of volatiles released. A distributed activation energy method (DAEM) was used to retrieve kinetic parameters from the measurements. When using a discrete distribution with a fixed pre-exponential factor of 2.2 x 10(13) [s(-1)], the main reaction path for wheat straw and olive residue appeared to be at 176 kJ/mol, while for the leached samples and for the peach stones sample it appeared at 184 kJ/mol. The leaching pretreatment removed I high percentage of mineral inclusions ill the samples, mostly in the forms of KCl and NaCl. This increased the temperature at which the samples decomposed, increased the released volatiles, and slightly increased the reaction rate.",1
"Wilson, K. S. and Humphreys, E. R. 2010. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from Arctic mudboils. Can. J. Soil Sci. 90: 441-449. Climate change is expected to alter the Arctic's carbon (C) balance and changes in these C-rich ecosystems may contribute to a positive feedback on global climate change. Low-center mudboils, a form of patterned ground in the Arctic, are distinct landforms in which the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and soil has not been fully characterized, but which may have an important influence on the overall C balance of tundra ecosystems. Chamber systems were used to sample net ecosystem exchange of CO(2) (NEE) and CO(2) and CH(4) effluxes along a 35-m transect intersecting two mudboils in a wet sedge fen in Canada's Southern Arctic (lat. 64 degrees 52'N, long. 111 degrees 34'W) during the summer months in 2008. Mudboil features gave rise to dramatic variations in vegetation, soil temperature and thaw depth, and soil organic matter content along this transect. Variations in NEE were driven by variations in the amount of vascular vegetation, while CO(2) and CH(4) effluxes were remarkably similar among the two mudboil (CO(2) effluxes: 1 +/- 0.9 and 4 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH(4) effluxes: 83.1 +/- 189.4 and 23.1 +/- 9.4 nmol m(-2) s(-1), +/-1 standard deviation) and the sedge fen (CO(2) effluxes: 6 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH(4) effluxes: 28.0 +/- 62.0 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) sampling areas. Vegetation appeared to play an important role in limiting temporal variations in CH(4) effluxes through plant mediated transport in both mudboil and sedge fen sampling areas. One of the mudboils had negligible vascular plant colonization presumably due to more active frost heave processes. The relatively high CO(2) and CH(4) efflux in this mudboil area was speculated to be a result of growth and decomposition of cryptogamic organisms, inflow of dissolved organic C, and warmer soil temperatures.",1
"States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). State emissions are significant on a global scale. CO2 and CO are the main GHGs associated with global warming. At the present time, coal is responsible for 30-40% of the world CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. SO2 and NOx contribute to acid rain. Carbon assessments can play an important role in a strategy to control carbon dioxide emissions while raising revenue. In 1992, Turkish Ministry of Environment issued a regulation providing for emissions testing for cars, trucks and vans. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Arctic ecosystems could provide a substantial positive feedback to global climate change if warming stimulates below-ground CO2 release by enhancing decomposition of bulk soil organic matter reserves. Ecosystem respiration during winter is important in this context because CO2 release from snow-covered tundra soils is a substantial component of annual net carbon (C) balance, and because global climate models predict that the most rapid rises in regional air temperature will occur in the Arctic during winter. In this manipulative field study, the relative contributions of plant and bulk soil organic matter C pools to ecosystem CO2 production in mid-winter were investigated. We measured CO2 efflux rates in Swedish sub-arctic heath tundra from control plots and from plots that had been clipped in the previous growing season to disrupt plant activity. Respiration derived from recently-fixed plant C (i.e., plant respiration, and respiration associated with rhizosphere exudates and decomposition of fresh litter) was the principal source of CO2 efflux, while respiration associated with decomposition of bulk soil organic matter was low, and appeared relatively insensitive to temperature. These results suggest that warmer mid-winter temperatures in the Arctic may have a much greater impact on the cycling of recently-fixed, plant-associated C pools than on the depletion of tundra bulk soil C reserves, and consequently that there is a low potential for significant initial feedbacks from arctic ecosystems to climate change during mid-winter.",1
"The pressure on the environment by human activity is still increasing and natural fossil resources are rapidly being Consumed.

"A methodology to estimate the space-time distribution of daily mean temperature under climate change is developed and applied to a central Nebraska case study. The approach is based on the analysis of the Markov properties of atmospheric circulation pattern (CP) types, and a stochastic linkage between daily (here 500 hPa) CP types and daily mean temperatures. Historical data and general circulation model (GCM) output of daily CP corresponding to 1 x CO2 and 2 x CO2 scenarios are considered. The relationship between spatially averaged geopotential height of the 500 hPa surface - within each CP type - and daily mean temperature is described by a nonparametric regression technique. Time series of daily mean temperatures corresponding to each of these cases are simulated and their statistical properties are compared. Under the climate of central Nebraska, the space-time response of daily mean temperature to global climate change is variable. In general, a warmer climate appears to cause about 5-degrees-C increase in the winter months, a smaller increase in other months with no change in July and August. The sensitivity of the results to the GCM utilized should be considered.",1
"Underground coal mines worldwide Liberate an estimated 29-41 x 10(9) m(3) of methane annually, of which less than 2.3 x 10(9) m(3) are used as fuel. The remaining methane is emitted to the atmosphere, representing the loss of a valuable energy resource. Methane is also a major greenhouse gas and is thus detrimental to the environment when vented to the atmosphere. Coal mine methane recovery and use represents a cost-effective means of significantly reducing methane emissions from coal mining, while increasing mine safety and improving mine economics. The world's ten largest coal producers are responsible for 90% of global methane emissions associated with the coal fuel cycle. China is the largest emitter of coal mine methane, followed by the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS (particularly Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan), the United States, Poland, Germany, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia, India and the Czech Republic. Most of these countries use a portion of the methane that is liberated from their coal mines, but the utilization rate tends to be low and some countries use none at all. Coal mine methane is currently used for a variety of purposes. Methane is used for heating and cooking at many mine facilities and nearby residences. It is also used to fuel boilers, to generate electricity, directly heat air for mine ventilation systems and for coal drying. Several mines in the United States sell high-quality mine gas to natural gas distributors. There are several barriers to decreasing methane emissions by increasing coal mine methane use. Many of the same barriers are common to a number of the subject countries. Technical barriers include low-permeability coals, variable or low gas quality, variations in gas supply and demand and lack of infrastructure. Economic and institutional barriers include lack of information pertinent to development of the resource, lack of capital and low natural gas prices. A possible option for encouraging coal mine methane recovery and use would be international adoption of a tradeable permit system for methane emissions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",1
"In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted an urgent need to assess the responses of marine ecosystems to climate change(1). Because they lie in a high-latitude region, the Southern Ocean ecosystems are expected to be strongly affected by global warming. Using top predators of this highly productive ocean(2) (such as penguins) as integrative indicators may help us assess the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems(3,4). Yet most available information on penguin population dynamics is based on the controversial use of flipper banding. Although some reports have found the effects of flipper bands to be deleterious(5-8), some short-term (one-year) studies have concluded otherwise(9-11), resulting in the continuation of extensive banding schemes and the use of data sets thus collected to predict climate impact on natural populations(12,13). Here we show that banding of free-ranging king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) impairs both survival and reproduction, ultimately affecting population growth rate. Over the course of a 10-year longitudinal study, banded birds produced 39% fewer chicks and had a survival rate 16% lower than non-banded birds, demonstrating a massive long-term impact of banding and thus refuting the assumption that birds will ultimately adapt to being banded(6,12). Indeed, banded birds still arrived later for breeding at the study site and had longer foraging trips even after 10 years. One of our major findings is that responses of flipper-banded penguins to climate variability (that is, changes in sea surface temperature and in the Southern Oscillation index) differ from those of non-banded birds. We show that only long-term investigations may allow an evaluation of the impact of flipper bands and that every major life-history trait can be affected, calling into question the banding schemes still going on. In addition, our understanding of the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems based on flipper-band data should be reconsidered.",1
"We present evidence of a recent drying in the eastern Mediterranean, based on weather and tree-ring data for Samos, an island of the eastern Aegean Sea. Rainfall declined rapidly after the late 1970s following trends for the entire Mediterranean and was associated with reduced tree-ring width in Pinus brutia. The most recent decline led to the lowest annual radial stem increment after the last 100 years (as far as records reach). As moisture availability decreased best correlations of tree growth with rainfall were obtained for progressively longer integration periods (1-2 years in moister periods, 5-6 years during the severe dryness of 20th century's last decades), suggesting increasing dependency in deep soil water. Such long-term integration periods of tree-growth responses to precipitation have not been reported before. They may reflect a tree-rooting pattern adapted to cope with even several successive dry years. In late summer 2000, moisture reserves became exhausted, however, and a substantial fraction of low altitude pines died, including some 80-year-old trees, which underlines the exceptional extent this trend had reached. Our findings provide empirical support for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections derived from global circulation models that the Mediterranean, its eastern basin in particular, should become drier as temperature rises, as was the case in the recent past.",1
"Carbonation is a stabilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) by solidification process. In order to prevent rapid climate change, it will be necessary to stabilize CO2 as carbonate by the carbonation process. Carbonation of the widely occurring mineral olivine (Mg2SiO4) converts CO2 into an environmentally benign mineral magnesite (MgCO3). The availability of a CO2 fixation technology would serve as insurance in case global warming causes severe restrictions on CO2 emissions. The yield of carbonation increased with increasing temperature. The rate of carbonation conversion sharply increased in initial 20 min and then reduced and reached a plateau value after about 40 min. The carbonation conversion with MgO is higher than that of CaO.",1
"Emissions may affect climate indirectly through chemical interactions in the atmosphere, but quantifications of such effects are difficult and uncertain due to incomplete knowledge and inadequate methods. A preliminary assessment of the climatic impact of changes in tropospheric O-3 and CH4 in response to various emissions is given. For a 10% increase in the CH4 emissions the relative increase in concentration has been estimated to be 37% larger. The radiative forcing from enhanced levels of tropospheric O-3 is estimated to 37% of the forcing from changes in CH4. Inclusion of indirect effects approximately doubles the climatic impact of CH4 emissions. Emissions of NOx increase tropospheric O-3, while the levels of CH4 are reduced. For emissions of NOx from aircraft, the positive effects via O-3 changes are significantly larger than the negative through changes in CH4. For NOx emitted from surface sources, the effects through changes in O-3 and CH4 are estimated to be of similar magnitude and large uncertainty is connected to the sign of the net effect. Emissions of CO have positive indirect effects on climate through enhanced levels of tropospheric O-3 and increased lifetime of CH4. These results form the basis for estimates of global warming potentials for sustained step increases in emissions.",1
"Atmospheric moisture content is expected to rise in response to global warming, but climate models predict a much slower rate of precipitation increase. This muted response of the hydrological cycle is investigated from a surface evaporation perspective, using a multimodel ensemble of simulations under the A1B forcing scenario. A 90-year analysis of surface evaporation based on a standard bulk formula reveals that the following atmospheric changes act to slow down the increase in surface evaporation over ice-free oceans: surface relative humidity increases by 0%, surface stability, as measured by air-sea temperature difference, increases by 0.2 K, and surface wind speed decreases by 0.02 m/s. As a result of these changes, surface evaporation increases by only 2% per Kelvin of surface warming, rather than the 7%/K rate simulated for atmospheric moisture. The increased surface stability and relative humidity are robust across models. The former is nearly uniform over ice-free oceans while the latter features a subtropical peak on either side of the equator. While relative humidity changes are positive almost everywhere in a thin surface layer, changes aloft show positive trends in the deep tropics and negative ones in the subtropics. The surface-trapped structure suggests the following mechanism: owing to its thermal inertia, the ocean lags behind the atmospheric warming, and this retarding effect causes an increase in surface stability and relative humidity, analogously to advection fog. Our results call for observational efforts to monitor and detect changes in surface relative humidity and stability over the world ocean.",1
"We report the first study of R-134a (also known as HFC-134a and CF3CFH2) refrigerant leakage from air conditioning (AC) systems of modern vehicles. Twenty-eight light duty vehicles from five manufacturers (Ford, Toyota, Daimler Chrysler, General Motors, and Honda) were tested according to the USEPA (Federal) extended diurnal test procedure using the Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determination (SHED) apparatus. All tests were conducted using stationary vehicles with the motor and air conditioning system turned off. R-134a was measured using gas chromatography (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID). All vehicles exhibited measurable R-134a leakage over the 2-day diurnal test. Leak rates of R-134a ranged from 0.01 to 0.36 g/day with an average of 0.07 +/- 0.07 g/day. When combined with leakage associated with vehicle operation, servicing, and disposal we estimate that the lifetime average R-134a emission rate from an AC equipped vehicle is 0.41 +/- 0.27 g/day (the majority of emissions are associated with vehicle servicing and disposal). Assuming that the average vehicle travels 10 000 miles per year we Estimate that the global warming impact of R-134a leakage from an AC equipped vehicle is approximately 4-5% of that of the CO2 emitted by the vehicle. The results are discussed with respect to the contribution of vehicle emissions to global climate change.",1
"There is very little doubt among the scientific community that human-induced greenhouse gas emission has contributed significantly to the climate change. Most significant changes in the earth's temperature have been noticed since the advent of the industrial era in the late 1800s. Over the past 100 years, the earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees C. Human activities such as the large-scale burning of fossil fuels to operate power plants and automobiles are releasing greenhouse gases like CO(2) into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate. Humans are currently releasing 70 million tonnes of CO(2) per day into the atmosphere. This paper draws from the major papers that have appeared in journals on this topic over the past two decades, and gives an overview of anthropogenic climate change and its impact on a wide variety of life-forms in various ecosystems. After a brief overview of climate change and its causes, focus is given to amphibian extinctions in Central America, the poleward and altitudinal shifts in the distribution of various organisms (especially butterflies), the. spread of pathogen-driven diseases, the bleaching of coral reefs, and the changes in community and trophic dynamics in various marine and terrestrial ecosystems.",1
"Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and its release to the atmosphere is widely believed to contribute to global warming. Ruminal enteric CH(4) production represents a loss of 2-15% of the animal's gross energy (GE) intake and contributes nearly 20% of US CH(4) emissions. Studies have evaluated the CH(4) inhibiting potential of select short chain nitrocompounds, such as nitroethane, but results demonstrating their effects on ruminant exhaled CH(4) emissions are lacking. Our study determined effects of oral nitroethane administration on CH(4) emissions, accumulations of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and on ruminal CH(4) producing activity in steers fed a forage based diet containing 8.8 MJ/kg of metabolizable energy on a dry matter (DM) basis. Effects of nitroethane administration on ruminal nitroethane reducing activity were also determined. Holstein steers (n = 24) of 317 +/- 6.5 kg body weight (BW) were assigned to 4 treatments that included: 0, 30, 60 and 120 mg nitroethane/kg BW/d. Treatments were administered via oral gavage twice daily at 08:00 and 16:00 h for 8 d. DM intake decreased quadratically as level of nitroethane increased with steers administered 60 and 120 mg nitroethane/kg BW consuming 14 and 7% lower DM, respectively, than steers administered 0 or 30 mg nitroethane/kg BW. Methane emissions as a proportion of GE intake and ruminal CH(4) producing activity both decreased linearly (P<0.001) as level of nitroethane increased. Compared to control steers, daily administration of nitroethane at 60 and 120 mg/kg BW reduced CH(4) emissions as a proportion of GE intake 9-22% and ruminal CH(4) producing activity 24-26%. Ruminal VFA accumulations were unaffected by nitroethane treatment. Results demonstrate that short term oral administration of nitroethane may be an effective anti-methanogenic compound in steers fed high forage diets. Further research is warranted to determine if strategies using nitroethane lower enteric CH(4) emissions in ruminants long term. Ultimately, nitrocompounds which can be reduced by rumen microbes to yield compounds with nutritional value for the host, such as amino acids, would be preferred.

"Future changes in daily and monthly Surface air temperature variability are associated with temperature extremes and thus will have a large impact on Our life and various sectors. In this study, we analyze variability of surface air temperature by 14 CMIP3 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model results. We first assess the 20th century climate in coupled models (20C3M) experiment for the period 1981-2000 with three reanalysis datasets and then show the changes in future climate for the period 2081-2100 under the SRES AIB scenario. The interannual variability of simulated monthly mean surface air temperature agrees with the observations based on three reanalysis datasets. Although there are large model-to-model scatters in the future changes of interannual variability, the ensemble mean of the available model results shows a large decrease in variability over the Northern Hemisphere high latitude region in winter, and an increase over the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and over the tropical land region in summer. For the daily temperature variability, the model ensemble mean underestimates the reanalysis data, probably related with less developed synoptic disturbances in the models than in reality. In future, the daily temperature variability is projected to increase over land in the Northern Hemisphere summer and in the tropics, and to decrease over the ocean throughout the year, consistent with the projected weakening of cyclonic disturbances. Inter-model variability is smaller than in the case for the interannual variability of monthly mean temperature.",1
"Climate models provide compelling evidence that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at present rates, then key global temperature thresholds (such as the European Union limit of two degrees of warming since pre-industrial times) are very likely to be crossed in the next few decades. However, there is relatively little attention paid to whether, should a dangerous temperature level be exceeded, it is feasible for the global temperature to then return to safer levels in a usefully short time. We focus on the timescales needed to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases and associated temperatures back below potentially dangerous thresholds, using a state-of-the-art general circulation model. This analysis is extended with a simple climate model to provide uncertainty bounds. We find that even for very large reductions in emissions, temperature reduction is likely to occur at a low rate. Policy-makers need to consider such very long recovery timescales implicit in the Earth system when formulating future emission pathways that have the potential to 'overshoot' particular atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and, more importantly, related temperature levels that might be considered dangerous.",1
"The municipal solid waste management significantly contributes to the emission in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2, CH4, N2O) and therefore the management process from collection to treatment and disposal has to be optimized in order to reduce these emissions. In this paper, starting from the average composition of undifferentiated municipal solid waste in Italy, the effect of separate collection on greenhouse gases emissions from municipal waste management has been assessed. Different combinations of separate collection scenarios and disposal options (i.e. landfilling and incineration) have been considered. The effect of energy recovery from waste both in landfills and incinerators has also been addressed. The results outline how a separate collection approach can have a significant effect on the emission of greenhouse gases and how wise municipal solid waste management, implying the adoption of Best Available Technologies (i.e. biogas recovery and exploitation system in landfills and energy recovery system in Waste to Energy plants), can not only significantly reduce greenhouse gases emissions but, in certain cases, can also make the overall process a carbon sink. Moreover it has been shown that separate collection of plastic is a major issue when dealing with global warming relevant emissions from municipal solid waste management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"A positive relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, the most important greenhouse gas (GHG) implicated in global warming, and GDP is shown in this paper, examining per capita income and CO2 emissions of 137 countries across 21 years. It also appears that as per capita incomes accelerate across countries emissions increases, for the most part, tend to decelerate. It could be that higher income levels lead to increased demand for environmental protection. Only emissions reduction proposals that assure incomes will not be adversely affected, particularly those of less developed countries (LDCs), will have any possibility of successful implementation.",1
"A reformulation of global warming potentials is propounded, that combines the time-horizon and discounting definitions, and covers both ordinary atmospheric forcing (via greenhouse gases) and its rate-of-change. Insofar as GWPs are used to guide investment and socioeconomic choices, there is merit in adopting cost-benefit techniques. The parametric equivalence of the two definitions applies for the ordinary atmospheric forcing; but for its rat-of-change, only the discounting definition gives realistic results, as shown in application to methane, a short-lived greenhouse gas.",1
"The climate model of intermediate complexity developed at the A. M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS CM) is supplemented by a scheme which takes into account the volcanic forcing of climate. With this model, ensemble experiments have been conducted for the 1600s-1900s, in which, along with the volcanic forcing, the anthropogenic forcing due to greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols and the natural forcing due to variations in solar irradiance were taken into account. The model realistically reproduces the annual mean response of surface air temperature and precipitation to major eruptions both globally and regionally. In particular, the decreases in the annual mean global temperature T-g in the IAP RAS CM after the largest eruptions in the latter half of the 20th century, the Mt. Agung (1963), El Chi-chon (1982), and Mt. Pinatubo (1991) volcanic eruptions, are 0.28, 0.27, and 0.46 K, respectively, in agreement with estimates from observational data. Moreover, in the IAP RAS CM, the volcanic eruptions result in a general precipitation decrease, especially over land in the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The seasonal distribution of the response shows good agreement with observations for high-latitude eruptions and worse agreement for tropical and subtropical volcanoes. On interdecadal scales, volcanism leads to variations in T-g on the order of 0.1 K. In numerical experiments with anthropogenic and natural forcings, the model reproduces a general change in surface air temperature over the past several centuries. Taking into account the volcanic forcing, along with that due to variations in solar irradiance, the model has partly reproduced the non-monotonic global warming for the 20th century.",1
"In this study the environmental burdens of home composting were determined using the life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. Data used for the LCA study such as gas emissions (CH(4), N(2)O, NH(3) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)), tools and composter characteristics were obtained from an experimental home composting process of leftovers of raw fruits and vegetables (LRFV). Stable compost with a high content of nitrogen and organic matter was obtained. Neither pathogens nor phytotoxic compounds were found in the final compost. In relation to gaseous emissions, only volatile organic compounds (0.32 kg VOC/Mg LRFV) were detected, even though ammonia, methane and nitrous oxide emissions were also measured. Regarding environmental burdens, the composter was the major contributor to the total home composting process impact for the impact categories of abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, and cumulative energy demand. Gaseous emissions (based on our own measurements and literature data) caused the greatest contribution to the acidification, eutrophication, global warming and photochemical oxidation potentials.

"This paper examines the fusion of conflicting and not independent expert opinion in the Transferable Belief Model. A hierarchical fusion procedure based on the partition of experts into schools of thought is introduced, justified by the sociology of science concepts of epistemic communities and competing theories. Within groups, consonant beliefs are aggregated using the cautious conjunction operator, to pool together distinct streams of evidence without assuming that experts are independent. Across groups, the non-interactive disjunction is used, assuming that when several scientific theories compete, they cannot be all true at the same time, but at least one will remain. This procedure balances points of view better than averaging: the number of experts holding a view is not essential. This approach is illustrated with a 16 expert real-world dataset on climate sensitivity obtained in 1995. Climate sensitivity is a key parameter to assess the severity of the global warming issue. Comparing our findings with recent results suggests that the plausibility that sensitivity is small (below 5 degrees C) has decreased since 1995, while the plausibility that it is above 4.5 degrees C remains high.

"The near-surface thermal regime in permafrost regions could change significantly in response to anthropogenic climate warming. Because there is only a small lag between these two processes, the impact of warming on the active layer can be investigated using relatively simple climate-driven models. A formulation attributable to Kudryavtsev was used to study the potential increase of active-layer thickness in the permafrost regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where warming is predicted to be more pronounced than elsewhere. Kudryavtsev's solution was validated using contemporary data, and successfully reproduced the actual depths of frost and thaw at widely spaced locations in North America and Eurasia. Modem climatic data and scenarios of climate change for 2050, derived from three transient coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs), were used in conjunction with the thaw-depth solution to generate hemispheric maps showing contemporary active-layer thickness for several soil types and moisture conditions, and its relative changes over the next century. The simulations indicate a 20-30% increase of active-layer thickness for most of the permafrost area in the Northern Hemisphere, with the largest relative increases concentrated in the northernmost locations.

"Rapid shifts in past climate recorded in polar ice sheets have elicited various explanations relating to either thermohaline circulation changes by ice-rafting or natural greenhouse gas concentrations modulated by climatic conditions in the tropics. To compare the tropical paleoclimate record with the polar record, one must choose sediment cores from highly productive ocean regions. Necessarily, such regions reflect the wind records in the tropics, because high productivity is associated with upwelling driven by winds. Comparing tropical precipitation records with high-latitude records is, however, a more difficult task because sediments recording paleoprecipitation usually have low sedimentation rates, and offer coarser resolution relative to polar ice cores. Here, we present delta O-18 data of three planktonic species of Foraminifera (a proxy for precipitation) from such a sediment core, spanning the past 35 ka for the equatorial Indian Ocean, which falls under the southwest monsoon (SWM) realm. Results show that minimum SWM precipitation occurred at the Last Glacial Maximum, with a subsequent increase at Termination IA. During the Holocene, SWM precipitation intensified uniformly up to the core top (similar to 2.2 ka B.P.), as revealed by generally decreasing delta O-18 values. Variations in precipitation are consistent with climate changes recorded in polar ice sheets. Although the different resolutions of the two records preclude a rigorous comparison, abrupt cooling/warming events appear to be accompanied by sudden reduction/enhancement in (SWM) rainfall. Thus, mechanisms with time scales much shorter than a millennium, such as natural greenhouse warming (e.g., CH4 concentration), controlled by emissions from the tropics, could have played a major role in high-latitude climate change.",1
"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important atmospheric trace gas due to its involvement in the postulated global warming phenomenon and in the depletion of the ozone layer. Widespread concern has been triggered by recent reports of increased atmospheric N2O concentration. Since agriculture has been implicated as one contributor to that increase, a monitoring program was undertaken during the 1993 and 1994 cropping season (May-October) to evaluate the effect of several soil management practices on N2O emission from soil. Our results show that rates of N2O emission were generally near baseline levels during most sampling occasions, Major, but short-lived, fluxes of N2O were observed after rainfall events and during the days immediately following fertilizer application. It was during these times that most of the seasonal N2O loss occurred. An excellent relationship was found between seasonal N2O loss (y) and the maximum daily flux of N2O (x) during a season (v = -0.4x(2) + 43.1 x + 338, r(2) = 0.89, P < 0.0001). The N2O emission data were log normally distributed for both years, Average daily emissions of N2O were 6.9 +/- 6.3 g (range, 0.3-74.7 g) N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1) and 17.6 +/- 10.5 g (range, 0.1-326 g) N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1) during the 1993 and 1994 seasons, respectively. Seasonal N2O-N losses were, in general, highest in the continuous corn (CC) (Zea mays L.) plots and lowest in the soybean (Glycine max L.) plots of the corn/soybean/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) rotation (CSW-V). Average N loss as N2O during a cropping season was between 0.6 kg (for the soybean crop of the CSWV rotation and ridge till treatment) and 3.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1), (for the CC rotation and the chisel till treatment). Approximately 0.5-3% of the inorganic N fertilizer added was lost as N2O. Our data show that seasonal N2O-N loss from chisel-till plots were generally significantly higher than From no-till or ridge till plots.",1
"Global climate change is predicted as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. It is predicted that climate change will result in increasing temperature by 2 to 6A degrees C and a possible reduction of precipitation of up to 16% in the Mediterranean basin. In this study, the West Bank is taken as a case study from the Mediterranean basin to evaluate the effects of such climate change on water resources availability and agricultural water demands. Due to the uncertainty in climate change impacts on temperature and precipitation, a number of scenarios for these impacts were assumed within the range of predicted changes. For temperature, three scenarios of 2, 4 and 6A degrees C increase were assumed. For precipitation, two scenarios of no change and 16% precipitation reduction were assumed. Based on these scenarios, monthly evapotranspiration and monthly precipitation excess depths were estimated at seven weather stations distributed over the different climatic and geographical areas of the West Bank. GIS spatial analyses showed that the increase in temperature predicted by climate change could potentially increase agricultural water demands by up to 17% and could also result in reducing annual groundwater recharge by up to 21% of existing values. However, the effects of reduced precipitation resulting from climate change are more enormous as a 16% reduction in precipitation could result in reducing annual groundwater recharge in the West Bank by about 30% of existing value. When this effect is combined with a 6A degrees C increase in temperature, the reduction in groundwater recharge could reach 50%.",1
"The utilization of CF3I in the plasma assisted dry etching of SiO2 has been studied in order to reduce the environmental impact of microelectronics device fabrication. The results show that CF3I is a promising substitute of CF4 in oxide etching since its utilization reduces 3-3.5 times the contribution to the global warming, nevertheless it still has a consistent effect on the environment for the plasma assisted formation of perfluorocompounds.

"In Norway, the boreal forest offers a considerable resource base, and emerging technologies may soon make it commercially viable to convert these resources into low-carbon biofuels. Decision makers are required to make informed decisions about the environmental implications of wood biofuels today that will affect the medium-and long-term development of a wood-based biofuels industry in Norway. We first assess the national forest-derived resource base for use in biofuel production. A set of biomass conversion technologies is then chosen and evaluated for scenarios addressing biofuel production and consumption by select industry sectors. We then apply an environmentally extended, mixed-unit, two-region input-output model to quantify the global warming mitigation and fossil fuel displacement potentials of two biofuel production and consumption scenarios in Norway up to 2050. We find that a growing resource base, when used to produce advanced biofuels, results in cumulative global warming mitigation potentials of between 58 and 83 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents avoided (Mt-CO(2)-eq.-avoided) in Norway, depending on the biofuel scenario. In recent years, however, the domestic pulp and paper industry-due to increasing exposure to international competition, capacity reductions, and increasing production costs-has been in decline. In the face of a declining domestic pulp and paper industry, imported pulp and paper products are required to maintain the demand for these goods and thus the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the exporting region embodied in Norway's pulp and paper imports reduce the systemwide benefit in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions by 27%.",1
"The use of fossil fuels has caused an increase in GHG concentration in the atmosphere, which has a direct effect oil global warming. Among the possible technologies to mitigate GHG emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) call be applied to existing, plants and now it is being accepted officially in order to gain emission reduction certificates. This paper presents a feasible Solution for CO, capture and storage network in Italy from Sources that are included in the National Allocation Plan and that are forced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the second phase of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The technical aspects of carbon sequestration are derived from industrial applications, while transportation and storage depend on local and geological characteristics. Since Italy has complex geological characteristics. the selection of the most convenient sites should include hydrocarbon reservoirs that are Currently used or are depleted. To select these sites, all oil wells that are located in the Italian territory and are managed by UNMIG (National Mining Office for Hydrocarbons and Geothermy) were considered, and a short list was selected among those that have safety and lasting characteristics to ensure a long time permanence. The position of the selected storage sites is drawn on It GIS map containing all the plants included in the National Allocation Plan to be able to identify the optimal networks for carbon dioxide transportation. The case study is located in an area that includes Milan, Pavia and Lodi districts. Knowing the amount of CO, produced by plants in the selected zone, it is possible to determine the tons of CO2 to capture and the size of transportation and storage systems. Pipelines are, in this case, the most appropriate transport technologies. From emission and sequestration points to storage sites it is necessary to build 122 kill pipelines for 8 MtCO(2), capacity. Using this CCS grid it is possible to avoid CO, emission with economic feasibility close to the cost of carbon trading values. In fact, the market cost of a European Union Allowance (EUA) at the start of the first period of application of Directive 2003/87/CE was about 30 is an element of/tCO(2).

"Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) accounting is important to global ecological footprint analysis. However methane (CH(4)), with a global warming potential (GWP) 25 times that of CO(2), should not be neglected as an environmental indicator for informed environmental management. While this is a significant component, the CH(4) associated with imported embodied energy should also be included in national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. This study proposes an initial method for incorporating methane into ecological footprint analyses and hopes to inform future debate on its inclusion. In order to account for differences in methane intensities from exporting countries, methane intensities for OECD countries were calculated using emission and energy consumption estimates taken directly from National Inventory Reports (NIR), published in conjunction with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For other countries the methane intensities were estimated using energy balances published by the International Energy Association (IEA) and IPCC default emission factors. In order to estimate embodied organic methane, material imports and exports were translated into units (such as live animals) capable of conversion into methane emissions. A significant increase in Ireland's footprint results from the inclusion of the GWP of methane is included within the footprint calculation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Studies from throughout the world have provided evidence that climate change is already affecting the ecology and persistence of species. Japan contributes valuable insights into understanding these changes through long-term records of the timing of cherry blossoms and other phenomena of ecological and cultural interest. The wide latitudinal spread of Japan also provides an opportunity to examine species over a broad range of environmental conditions. In this review, we examine phenological studies that have taken place in Japan and summarize their significance to climate change and conservation research. In Kyoto, records of the timing of celebrations of cherry blossom festivals going back to the 9th century reconstruct the past climate and demonstrate the local increase in temperature associated with global warming and urbanization. This record is probably the longest annual record of phenology from anyplace in the world and shows that cherries are currently flowering earlier than they have at any time during the previous 1200 years. Detailed mapping of cherry tree flowering times in and around Osaka and other cities in Japan show that urbanization causes plants to flower earlier within the city environs than in nearby parks and outlying suburban areas. Flowering records from a large cherry arboretum at Mt. Takao, on the outskirts of Tokyo, show that both among and within species, early flowering is associated with greater responsiveness to temperature variation. Lastly, records of phenology for a wide range of plants and animals recorded at over 100 weather stations throughout Japan show that species vary greatly in their phenological responses to climate change, and highlight ecological relationships that need to be investigated in the field. Together, these studies provide important insights into how species are responding to climate change in Japan. Further research, particularly targeted field observations and experiments, is needed to build on these findings and to improve our understanding of how climate change is altering biological communities and how it will continue to affect them in the future.

"There are about 5000 billion tons of fossil fuel carbon in accessible reserves. Combustion of all this carbon within the next few centuries would force high atmospheric CO2 content and extreme global warming. On the other hand, low atmospheric CO2 content favors the onset of an ice age when changes in the Earth's orbit lead to low summer insolation at high northern latitudes. Here I present Earth System Model projections showing that typical reduction targets for fossil fuel use in the present century could limit ongoing global warming to less than one degree Celcius above present. Furthermore, the projections show that combustion pulses of remaining fossil fuel reserves could then be tailored to raise atmospheric CO2 content high and long enough to parry forcing of ice age onsets by summer insolation minima far into the future. Our present interglacial period could be extended by about 500,000 years in this way. Citation: Shaffer, G.

"Feedback processes in the carbon budget are investigated in a manner that parallels the treatment of feedback processes in the energy budget. The analysis is applied to simulations with the CCCma earth system model CanESM1 using a range of emission scenarios. For the atmosphere there is a positive ""carbon-temperature'' feedback which acts to increase CO(2) flux to the atmosphere as temperatures warm. There is also a negative ""carbon-concentration'' feedback which acts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere via enhanced uptake of CO2 by the land and ocean as CO2 concentration increases. While the positive feedback associated with temperature change is reasonably linear and consistent as temperature increases, the feedback associated with CO2 concentration is not. The negative carbon-concentration feedback weakens with increasing CO2 concentration thereby enhancing atmospheric CO2 and accelerating global warming. The behaviour of the inferred carbon-concentration feedback is different for different emission scenarios implying a dependence on state variables other than CO2 concentration. The carbon-concentration feedback behaviour inferred for a particular scenario may not, therefore, be used to infer system behaviour for other scenarios. Citation: Boer, G. J., and V.

"Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well as waste gas streams from industrial and power stations has become the present day's world-wide attraction for many reasons, the most important being the trapping of heat from the sun by CO2 and hence disruption of global warming effect. Activated carbon and CMS samples were prepared from coal samples of different origin. The effects of the various process parameters to prepare CMS from various coals were studied. Pre-oxidation of the coal, activation using CO2 and pore narrowing through coke deposition by benzene cracking were the major process parameters used to prepare the CMS in this work. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the samples was studied using gravimetric as well as volumetric methods. The adsorption capacity Of CO2 on the CMS samples prepared was found to be 6 mmol/g of the adsorbent with an uptake ratio at equilibrium adsorption for CO2/CH4, >> 20. The morphology of the pore structure of the samples was studied using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The N-2 adsorption on the samples at liquid N-2 temperature was found to be very poor and hence surface area measurement was done using CO2 adsorption data. The BET surface area thus calculated was found to be 20% less than the DA surface area calculated.",1
"River runoff from the world's major rivers is an important part of the hydrologic cycle. Runoff changes in response to global greenhouse-induced warming will have impacts in many areas, including agriculture, water resources, and land use. A global atmospheric model is used to calculate the annual river runoff for 33 of the world's major rivers for the present climate and for a doubled CO2 climate. The model has a horizontal resolution of 4-degrees x 5-degrees, but the runoff from each model grid box is quartered and added to the appropriate river drainage basin on a 2-degrees x 2.5-degrees resolution. The computed runoff depends on the model's precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture storage. For the doubled CO2 climate, the runoff increased for 25 to the 33 rivers, and in most cases the increases coincided with increased rainfall within the drainage basins. There were runoff increases in all rivers in high northern latitudes, with a maximum increase of 47%. At low latitudes there were both increases and decreases ranging from a 96% increase to a 43% decrease. The effect of the simplified model assumptions of land-atmosphere interactions on the results is discussed.",1
"The current rate of warming due to increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is very likely unprecedented over the last 10,000 y. Although the majority of countries have adopted the view that global warming must be limited to <2 degrees C, current GHG emission rates and nonagreement at Copenhagen in December 2009 increase the likelihood of this limit being exceeded by 2100. Extensive evidence has linked major changes in biological systems to 20th century warming. The ""Global 200"" comprises 238 ecoregions of exceptional biodiversity [Olson DM, Dinerstein E (2002) Ann Mo Bot Gard 89:199-224]. We assess the likelihood that, by 2070, these iconic ecoregions will regularly experience monthly climatic conditions that were extreme in 1961-1990. Using >600 realizations from climate model ensembles, we show that up to 86% of terrestrial and 83% of freshwater ecoregions will be exposed to average monthly temperature patterns >2 SDs (2 sigma) of the 1961-1990 baseline, including 82% of critically endangered ecoregions. The entire range of 89 ecoregions will experience extreme monthly temperatures with a local warming of <2 degrees C. Tropical and subtropical ecoregions, and mangroves, face extreme conditions earliest, some with <1 degrees C warming. In contrast, few ecoregions within Boreal Forests and Tundra biomes will experience such extremes this century. On average, precipitation regimes do not exceed 2s of the baseline period, although considerable variability exists across the climate realizations. Further, the strength of the correlation between seasonal temperature and precipitation changes over numerous ecoregions. These results suggest many Global 200 ecoregions may be under substantial climatic stress by 2100.",1
"This paper estimates changes in the potential damage of flood events caused by increases of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It is presented in two parts:  the modelling of flood frequency and magnitude under global warming and associated rainfall intensities and 2. the use of greenhouse flood data to assess changes in the vulnerability of flood prone urban areas, expressing these in terms of direct losses. Three case studies were selected: the Hawkesbury-Nepean corridor, the Queanbeyan and Upper Parramatta Rivers. All three catchments are located in southeastern Australia, near Sydney and Canberra. These were chosen because each had detailed building data bases available and the localities are situated on rivers that vary in catchment size and characteristics. All fall within a region that will experience similar climate change under the available greenhouse scenarios. The GCMs' slab model scenarios of climate change in 2030 and 2070 will cause only minor changes to urban flood damage but the double CO2 scenarios estimated using the Stochastic Weather Generator technique will lead to significant increases in building damage. For all the case studies, the hydrological modelling indicates that there will be increases in the magnitude and frequency of flood events under the double CO2 conditions although these vary from place to place. However, the overall pattern of change is that for the Upper Parramatta River the 1 in 100-year flood under current conditions becomes the 1 in 44-year event, the 1 in 35-year flood for the Hawkesbury-Nepean and the 1 in 10 for Queanbeyan and Canberra. This indicates the importance of using rainfall-runoff modelling in order to estimate changes in flood frequencies in catchments with different physical characteristics.",1
"Mitigating global climate change will require a profound transformation of energy use sectors throughout the world and this challenge is particularly acute for the United States transportation sector. Market forces alone are unlikely to change transportation-energy technologies and infrastructures sufficiently to address the needs for an environmentally sustainable system. A set of policies for encouraging technological advances and promoting sustainable planning, operations, and pricing of transportation services was analysed for its effects on sector energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Baseline projections show US transport sector GHG emissions increasing over the 1990 level 28% by 2010 and 58% by 2030. The combined impacts of the policies analysed would be substantial emission reductions that grow over time, with GHG emissions returned to the 1990 level by 2010 and cut to 35% lower by 2030. Due to fuel savings from technology-based efficiency improvements, it was found that the economic benefits accruing from these reductions would outpace costs almost from the outset.

"Increasing evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change is affecting biodiversity. Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.",1
"Climate change has been recognized as the foremost environmental problem of the twenty-first century and has become a subject of considerable debate. It is predicted to lead to adverse, irreversible impacts oil earth and the ecosystem as a whole.

Climate change has been implicated in mass mortalities of mail), aquatic species, including plants. fish, corals, and mammals. Climate change is an emerging threat to global public health and is predicted to affect human health in many ways including heat stress (stroke), air pollution, food scarcity, spread of infectious diseases and intensity of disease outbreaks.

"This paper presents a simple way to approximate the dependence of the global mean air temperature at Earth's surface on the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. It treats the atmosphere as a blanket, the effective thermal conductivity of which is a decreasing function of the amount of CO2 present, and does not involve the details of energy transport. The only data required are the CO2 concentrations at the middle of the nineteenth and the end of the twentieth centuries, and the shift in temperature that has occurred over that time. This elementary, phenomenological energy-balance approach is well suited for undergraduate physics courses to illustrate thermal conduction and radiation, by way of the very interesting and critically important example of greenhouse warming of Earth.

The commonly accepted range for the equilibrium global mean temperature change in response to a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration(1), termed climate sensitivity, is 5-4.5 K (ref. 2). A number of observational studies(3-10), however, find a substantial probability of significantly higher sensitivities, yielding upper limits on climate sensitivity of 7.7 K to above 9 K (refs 3-8). Here we demonstrate that such observational estimates of climate sensitivity can be tightened if reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature over the past several centuries are considered. We use large-ensemble energy balance modelling and simulate the temperature response to past solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing to determine which climate sensitivities yield simulations that are in agreement with proxy reconstructions. After accounting for the uncertainty in reconstructions and estimates of past external forcing, we find an independent estimate of climate sensitivity that is very similar to those from instrumental data. If the latter are combined with the result from all proxy reconstructions, then the 5-95 per cent range shrinks to 5-6.2 K, thus substantially reducing the probability of very high climate sensitivity.",1
"Certain concerns about sustainable transportation derive from the premise that significant atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming can be attributed to automotive emissions. Among measures considered to curtail automobile dependency and increase transit modal split, ""full cost pricing"" - a means of extracting both environmental costs and hidden subsidies which road users allegedly impose on society - has emerged as an increasingly popular suggestion. This paper examines the potential impact of full cost pricing on the ""sustainability"" of urban transportation, using Toronto as a case study. The analysis deals with the direct effects on mode choice and vehicle utilization resulting from increased user costs as might be achieved through fuel taxes or road pricing, as well as the indirect, longer term effects on location decisions. To investigate the land-use impacts, population distributions were altered to reflect more compact development and less urban sprawl as a proxy for relocations that might result from an increase in the costs of automobile use. Impacts are presented in terms of changes in total peak period vehicle-kilometres, mode split, and CO2 emissions. Despite several qualifications related to modelling techniques used in the case study, the analysis suggests that, overall, the impacts of large increases in road user costs appear to be less than proponents of full cost pricing would expect. In addition, the analysis suggests the fairly obvious, namely, that the greatest impacts of pricing occur within those choice markets where reasonable alternatives to the private automobile actually exist.",1
"Arid ecosystems, which occupy about 20% of the earth's terrestrial surface area, have been predicted to be one of the most responsive ecosystem types to elevated atmospheric CO2 and associated global climate change(1-3). Here we show, using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem(4), that new shoot production of a dominant perennial shrub is doubled by a 50% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in a high rainfall year. However, elevated CO2 does not enhance production in a drought year. We also found that aboveground production and seed rain of an invasive annual grass increases more at elevated CO2 than in several species of native annuals. Consequently, elevated CO2 might enhance the longterm success and dominance of exotic annual grasses in the region. This shift in species composition in favour of exotic annual grasses, driven by global change, has the potential to accelerate the fire cycle, reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem function in the deserts of western North America.",1
"The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was used to elucidate the role of climate, soil properties, and farming practices in determining spatial and temporal variations in the production and emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) from agriculture in the United States. Sensitivity studies documented possible causes of annual variability in N2O flux for a simulated Iowa corn-growing soil. The 37 scenarios tested indicated that soil tillage and nitrate pollution in rainfall may be especially significant anthropogenic factors which have increased N2O emissions from soils in the United States. Feedbacks to climate change and biogeochemical manipulation of agricultural soil reflect complex interactions between the nitrogen and carbon cycles. A 20% increase in annual average temperature in degrees C produced a 33% increase in N2O emissions. Manure applications to Iowa corn crops enhanced carbon storage in soils, but also increased N2O emissions. A DNDC simulation of annual N2O emissions from all crop and pasture lands in the United States indicated that the value lies in the range 0.9 - 2 TgN. Soil tillage and fertilizer use were the most important farming practices contributing to enhanced N2O emissions at the national scale. Soil organic matter and climate variables were the primary determinants of spatial variability in N2O emissions. Our results suggest that the United States Government, and possibly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC), have underestimated the importance of agriculture as a national and global source of atmospheric N2O. The coupled nature of the nitrogen and carbon cycles in soils results in complex feedbacks which complicate the formulation of strategies to reduce the global warming potential of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.",1
"According to the simplest model of the earth's radiative balance, global warming will occur with certainty as humankind increases its production and consumption of nonsolar energy. This prediction is revisited, using a broader model that allows the greenhouse effect to be considered. The new model predicts a global warming of Delta T-E =(114 K)epsilon, where epsilon is the rate of surface energy release in units of the average incident solar radiation, 342 W m(-2), and Delta T-E is the average temperature rise at the earth's surface. Present values of these quantities, excluding geothermal sources, are epsilon = 0.69 x 10(-4) and Delta T-E = 7.9 mK. The model assigns a small number of optical parameters to the atmosphere and surface and qualifies the simple warming prediction: It is rigorous only if parameters other than epsilon are unchanged. The model is not complex and should serve as an aid to an elementary understanding of global warming. (C) 1999 American Association of Physics Teachers.",1
"It is now accepted that climate change is due to the cumulative and joint effect of multiple atmospheric trace constituents. The importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to global warming that would account for multiple interacting pollutants is increasingly recognized. In this paper we propose to extend the analysis of intertemporal permit trading to a framework encompassing multiple correlated pollutants. In doing so our aim is to assess the consequence of providing ""when flexibility"" to participants in a pollution market scheme with respect to the timing of use of their permits. In the same manner as local pollution hotspots have been identified as potential drawbacks of allowing intra-regional trade, temporal flexibility has the potential to induce a type of ""temporal hotspot"" of pollution that could undermine the efficiency of intertemporal trading schemes especially when the stock of a particular pollution induces damage in itself but also impacts on the accumulation of another detrimental pollution stock. In a first step, we assess the impact of various types of correlations (technological and physical) on the socially optimal accumulation of regional and global pollutants. We illustrate that even in the case of a linear damage function the regional stocks may have ambiguous impacts on the global stock. In a second step, we show that it is possible for a global benevolent regulator to have recourse to a set of intertemporal trading schemes to induce individual agents to take socially optimal decisions over time. One requirement is to implement a set of time-dependent intertemporal trading rates. We also analyze the impact on pollutants accumulation of implementing non-optimal intertemporal trading rates.

"The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), an approximately 170,000-year-long period of global warming about 56 million years ago, has been attributed to the release of thousands of petagrams of reduced carbon into the ocean, atmosphere and biosphere(1,2). However, the fate of this excess carbon at the end of the event is poorly constrained: drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been attributed to an increase in the weathering of silicates or to increased rates of organic carbon burial(1,3-5). Here we develop constraints on the rate of carbon drawdown based on rates of carbon isotope change in well-dated marine and terrestrial sediments spanning the event. We find that the rate of recovery is an order of magnitude more rapid than that expected for carbon drawdown by silicate weathering alone. Unless existing estimates of carbon stocks and cycling during this time are widely inaccurate, our results imply that more than 2,000 Pg of carbon were sequestered as organic carbon over 30,000-40,000 years at the end of the PETM. We suggest that the accelerated sequestration of organic carbon could reflect the regrowth of carbon stocks in the biosphere or shallow lithosphere that were released at the onset of the event.",1
"According to the bioclimatic zones, dune mobility and the fabric characteristics of stratigraphic sedimentary facies, the deserts in China are divided into Eastern, Western, Central and Northwestern deserts. Based on the records of stratigraphical facies, climatic proxies, historical data, etc. in each desert region, the evolution of deserts with climatic changes in time and space since 150 ka B.P. in China are dealt with; then the evolution of deserts in relation to the glacial climatic fluctuations caused by solar radiation changes, underlying surface variation and their feedback mechanism is discussed through comparison with global records; finally, in consideration of global warming due to increasing of greenhouse gases such as CO2, the possible tendency of the evolution of deserts and the climatic changes is discussed.",1
"Since the decomposition rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) varies as a function of environmental conditions, global climate change is expected to alter SOC decomposition dynamics, and the resulting changes in the amount of CO2 emitted from soils will feedback onto the rate at which climate change occurs. While this soil feedback is expected to be significant because the amount of SOC is substantially more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, the environmental dependencies of decomposition at global scales that determine the magnitude of the soil feedback have remained poorly characterized. In this study, we address this issue by fitting a mechanistic decomposition model to a global dataset of SOC, optimizing the model's temperature and moisture dependencies to best match the observed global distribution of SOC. The results of the analysis indicate that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition at global scales (Q(10)=37) is significantly less than is assumed by many terrestrial ecosystem models that directly apply temperature sensitivity from small-scale studies, and that the maximal rate of decomposition occurs at higher moisture values than is assumed by many models. These findings imply that the magnitude of the soil decomposition feedback onto rate of global climate change will be less sensitive to increases in temperature, and modeling of temperature and moisture dependencies of SOC decomposition in global-scale models should consider effects of scale.",1
"The uptake and redistribution of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) CFC-11 and CFC-12 are studied in a series of world, ocean model experiments. In part 1 of this study the sensitivity of the simulated CFC distributions to the model parameterization of air-sea CFC fluxes is examined within a control experiment. The control experiment represents a low-resolution ocean model with global coverage and a proper seasonal cycling in surface thermohaline and wind stress conditions. The specification of a surface ocean CFC concentration that is instantaneously in saturated equilibrium with the atmosphere is found to flux too much CFC into the model. Signatures of CFC-11 are found to be grossly overestimated in regions of deep and bottom water formation, both in the surface mixed layer and at depth. The use of a classical air-sea gas exchange formula (even one with a simplified gas transfer velocity that is independent of wind speed) is seen to greatly improve the CFC simulations at depth. In addition, the model reproduces many of the observed trends in surface CFC concentrations; namely, undersaturation in regions of deep convective overturn and near-surface upwelling and supersaturation in the summer mixed layer. In further sensitivity experiments, we consider the effect of sea ice cover in limiting air-sea gas exchange in polar waters. It is found that bottom water in the Arctic Ocean and around the Antarctic continent is significantly reduced in CFC content once regions covered with sea ice are limited to fractional air-sea gas exchange. This more physically meaningful framework is found to further reduce the spurious uptake of CFC-11 and CFC-12 found under a ''saturated surface'' assumption. In a final sensitivity experiment the gas exchange rate is parameterized using a complete wind speed and Schmidt number dependence. The wind speed dependent gas forcing increases the surface CFC equilibration rate under the subpolar westerlies. On the other hand, the polar and tropical oceans witness reduced CFC uptake under a wind speed dependent flux regime. Simulated ocean CFC concentrations are compared directly with observational data in certain key areas for deep and bottom water formation. It is found that a reasonable representation of oceanic CFC is achieved in the convected water column in the Weddell and Labrador Seas. In contrast, deep waters that have left the convective area with the model ocean currents are found to be deficient in CFC-11 in the North Atlantic Ocean. This is because the model advective timescale for North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) outflow across the equator is too long compared with observed ocean estimates. The long timescale is not due to unrealistically sluggish deep currents. Rather, the path of NADW outflow includes a loop eastward from the Labrador Sea into the Northeastern Atlantic Basin, effectively increasing the required outflow journey by around 4000 km. This ages the water mass by almost 10 years, thereby yielding significantly lower CFC concentrations in the NADW extension. In addition, the outflow signature spreads too far into the eastern North Atlantic, presumably because the advective process is too broad and the horizontal diffusion too strong at depth. Contrasting the North Atlantic, bottom water CFC ventilation in the Southern Ocean is found to be too strong, even when significant levels of surface undersaturation are simulated in polar waters. CFC-tagged waters flowing into the deep South Atlantic basin (from the Weddell Sea formation zone) are too enriched in CFC11, even when the deep signatures adjacent to the Antarctic shelf remain close to observations. This suggests that the advective timescale for bottom water ventilation is too rapid in the Southern Ocean. In addition, too much convective overturn persists in the Southern Ocean at 55 degrees S-70 degrees S, with unrealistically deep CFC-11 penetration noted at particular longitudes. This is because not enough older (CFC-deprived) water recirculates and upwells into the Southern Ocean. For example, more upwelled circumpolar deep water in the Southern Ocean would weaken the CFC-11 concentrations by contributing to a lower CFC mixture and by suppressing the convective activity in the region. Bottom and deep level CFC signatures are broad and diffuse compared with the real ocean. The broadness of the CFC imprint is due, in part, to the model resolution, which gives any convective event a spatial extent of at least 3.75 degrees longitude by 4.5 degrees latitude and a bottom level CFC signal thickness in excess of 800 m. An important finding of our study is that the vertical convection of unstable waters acts as the efficient tracer ventilator of the ocean system. This has significant implications for numerical studies of the world's climate, since the meridional overturning has traditionally been considered the reason for the ocean's moderating influence during global warming scenarios. Our study suggests that the vertical convection would play a much greater role over the typical timescale for anthropogenic climate change.",1
"Urban areas are significant contributors to global carbon dioxide emissions. Vehicle emissions and other anthropogenic related activities are a frequent source Of CO2 to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Micrometeorological techniques used for observations in Northern Hemisphere cities have found that urban CO2 fluxes are consistently a source. This study investigates CO2 fluxes in an Australian city, adding to the global database of CO2 fluxes in a bid to aid in future development of planning policies concerning reductions in CO2 emissions. Using the eddy covariance approach, fluxes Of CO2 were measured at a suburban site (Preston) in Melbourne, Australia from February 2004 to June 2005 to investigate temporal variability. A second site (Surrey Hills) with differing surface characteristics (in particular, greater vegetation cover) was also established in Melbourne and ran simultaneously for 6 months (February 2004-July 2004). Results showed that both sites were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Diurnal patterns of fluxes were largely influenced by traffic volumes, with two distinct peaks occurring at the morning and evening traffic peak hours, with the winter morning peak averaging 10.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at Preston. Summer time fluxes were lower than during winter due to greater vegetative influence and reduced natural gas combustion. Vegetation limited the source of CO2 in the afternoon, yet was not enough to combat the strong local anthropogenic emissions. Surrey Hills showed higher fluxes Of CO2 despite greater vegetation cover because of higher local traffic volumes. Annual emissions from Preston were estimated at 84.9 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1). Magnitudes and patterns of suburban CO2 fluxes in Melbourne were similar to those observed in Northern Hemisphere suburban areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Global warming is a serious problem requiring immediate countermeasures. Large-scale afforestation in and areas for the aim of absorbing CO2 is considered to be one of these measures and the research activities for it have been carried out in Leonora, Western Australia. In this study, the relationship between the biomass distribution and topographic features was examined in order to collect basic information for the selection of suitable afforestation regions in the research area using a biomass distribution map and some topographic elements. The results were as follows. (1) Plant growth is related to the movement of and the volume of runoff water derived from inequality of the ground, which leads to a biased distribution of nutrient accumulation and of surface soil thickness. (2) The total potential biomass estimated from the present topography is greater than the present biomass in the 30 km x 50 km research area. A mass of 319 kt-C could be absorbed in the research area without any improvements in the landform. (3) A substantial improvement on the environment utilizing vast and areas by afforestation is necessary to fix enough carbon deterring global warming.",1
"We discuss aspects of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) and its response to increased greenhouse gas concentration, using a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) whose oceanic component is a now hybrid-isopycnal model. Two 200-year model integrations are carried out - a control run assuming fixed atmospheric composition and a perturbation run assuming gradual doubling of CO2. We employ no flux corrections at the air-sea interface, nor do we spin up the ocean prior to coupling. The surface conditions in the control run stabilize after several decades. When doubling CO2 at the rate of 1% per year, the model responds with a 2 degreesC increase in global mean surface air temperature (SAT) after 200 years and a virtually unchanged Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. The latter is maintained by a salinity increase that counteracts the effect of global warming on the surface buoyancy.",1
"Tropospheric sulfate aerosols produced by atmospheric oxidation of SO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion scatter solar radiation and enhance the reflectivity of clouds. Both effects decrease the absorption of solar radiation by the earth-atmosphere system. This cooling influence tends to offset the warming influence resulting from increased absorption of terrestrial infrared radiation by increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The sulfate forcing is estimated to be offsetting 70% of the forcing by CO2 derived from fossil fuel combustion, although the uncertainty of this estimate is quite large-range 28 to 140%, the latter figure indicating that the present combined forcing is net cooling. Because of the vastly different atmospheric residence times of sulfate aerosol (about a week) and CO2 (about 100 years), the cooling influence of sulfate aerosol is exerted immediately, whereas most of the warming influence of CO2 is exerted over more than 100 years. Consequently the total forcing integrated over the entire time the materials reside in the atmosphere is net warming, with the total CO2 forcing estimated to exceed the sulfate forcing by a factor of 4 (uncertainty range 2 to more than 10). The present situation in which the forcing by sulfate is comparable to that; by CO2 is shown to be a consequence of the steeply increasing rates of emissions over the industrial era.",1
"Sea surface temperatures and salinity profiles in the Baltic Sea have been analyzed under different climate conditions using a 3D coupled ice-ocean model. As a reference, hindcast simulations for the period 1980-93 have been performed using observed three-hourly meteorological forcing fields and observed monthly river runoff. The results are compared with available observations from monitoring stations. The observed Baltic Sea climate is well reproduced by the model. Furthermore, two sets of 9-year time slice experiments have been performed using results from an atmospheric regional climate model as forcing. One of the time slice sets represents pre-industrial greenhouse conditions (control simulation), and the other set represents a global warming condition with a 150% increase in equivalent CO(2) concentrations (scenario simulation) with lateral boundary conditions from the global atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, HadCM2. To simulate river runoff, a large-scale hydrological model has been applied. As the time slices are too short to properly spin up initial stratification for future climate, salinity is treated as an uncertainty factor. An extreme condition is obtained by integrating the Baltic Sea model for a period of 100 years while assuming that no salt water inflow will occur in the future. Salinity in the Gotland Basin decreases in the surface layer by about 3 to 4 psu and in the bottom layer by about 6 to 6.5 psu. The final quasi-equilibrium is characterized by salinities of 2.8 psu (minimum at the surface) to 6.5 psu (maximum at the bottom). The area averaged annual mean sea surface temperature change between scenario and control run is about 2.3 degreesC. The warming in different seasons is almost the same. The computational effective time slice approach in dynamical downscaling experiments is regarded as a feasible technique to regionalize global climate change experiments in the Baltic Sea.",1
"It is commonly believed that greenhouse-gas-induced global warming can weaken the east Asian winter monsoon but strengthen the summer monsoon, because of stronger warming over high-latitude land as compared to low-latitude oceans. In this study, we show that the surface wind speed associated with the east Asian monsoon has significantly weakened in both winter and summer in the recent three decades. From 1969 to 2000, the annual mean wind speed over China has decreased steadily by 28%, and the prevalence of windy days (daily mean wind speed > 5 m/s) has decreased by 58%. The temperature trends during this period have not been uniform. Significant winter warming in northern China may explain the decline of the winter monsoon, while the summer cooling in central south China and warming over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific Ocean may be responsible for weakening the summer monsoon. In addition, we found that the monsoon wind speed is also highly correlated with incoming solar radiation at the surface. The present results, when interpreted together with those of recent climate model simulations, suggest two mechanisms that govern the decline of the east Asian winter and summer monsoons, both of which may be related to human activity. The winter decline is associated with global-scale warming that may be attributed to increased greenhouse gas emission, while the summer decline is associated with local cooling over south-central China that may result from air pollution.",1
"A new disposal process for anthropogenic CO: via an artificially accelerated weathering reaction is proposed to counteract global warming. The process is essentially composed of the following two steps: (1) CaSiO3 + 2CH(3)COOH --> Ca2+ + 2CH(3)COO(-) + H2O + SiO2. (2) Ca2+ + 2CH(3)COO(-) + CO2 + H2O --> CaCO(3)down arrow+ 2CH(3)COOH. Step (1) is the extraction of calcium ions by acetic acid from calcium silicate, for example, wollastonite rocks. Step (2) is the deposition of calcium carbonate from the solution of calcium ions by CO2 injection. The Gibbs free energy change of each step is negative; the reactions would proceed spontaneously without consuming large amounts of energy. The CO2 would be captured from the concentrated emission sources such as thermal power plant, and be disposed of and sequestrated in the form of calcium carbonate. The feasibility of the proposed process was evaluated through a process design based on the experimental results of the reaction kinetics. The operational energy consumption was 20.4 MW for the disposal of CO2 produced by a 100-MW thermal power plant. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Looked at in a simplistic way, aerosols have counteracted the warming effects of greenhouse gases (GHG) over the past century. This has not only provided some climate protection', but also prevented the true magnitude of the problem from becoming evident. In particular, it may have resulted in an underestimation of the sensitivity of the climate system to the effect of GHG. Over the present century, the role of aerosols in opposing global warming will wane, as there are powerful policy reasons to reduce their emissions and their atmospheric lifetimes are short in contrast to those of the GHG. On the other hand, aerosols will continue to play a role in regional climate change, especially with regard to the water cycle. The end of significant climate protection by atmospheric aerosols, combined with the potentially very high sensitivity of the climate system, makes sharp and prompt reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, very urgent.",1
"This paper describes the rainfall-runoff modelling for New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) under historical climate and the likely changes to runoff around the year 2030 for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SRES A1B global warming scenario. Results show that the mean annual historical rainfall and runoff, averaged over the entire region, are 516 and 55 mm, respectively. There is considerable uncertainty in the global climate modelling (GCM) of rainfall response in the region to global warming. The majority of GCMs show a decrease in the mean annual rainfall and the median estimate indicates that future mean annual runoff in the region in similar to 2030 relative to similar to 1990 will be lower by 0-20% in the southern parts, no change to a slight reduction in the eastern parts and higher by 0-20% in the northwest corner. Averaged across the entire region, the median estimate is a 5% decrease in the mean annual runoff and the extreme estimates range from a 14% decrease to a 10% increase in mean annual runoff. This is the first comprehensive study on the hydrological impacts of climate change done in NSW that covers the entire state. Outputs from this study are being used to underpin the hydrology for a number of major climate change impact studies that are presently underway across NSW. The results and output datasets from this study will be available through a web interface and they can be used by all state government agencies and industries in NSW to plan for and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

"The Climate Challenge is a partnership between the Department of Energy and the electric utility industry to reduce, avoid, and sequester greenhouse gases. A portion of the initiative, the sequestration of greenhouse gases, is the focus of this presentation. Over 4 million acres of bottomland hardwood forests were cleared for agriculture in the Mississippi River Valley in the 1970s. Reestablishing these forests would improve depleted wildlife habitats, serve as wildlife corridors, increase biodiversity, and decrease soil erosion. Also, Louisiana is losing coastal wetlands at a rate of approximately 25 square miles/year. This coastal erosion is due to a number of factors and many efforts are currently underway to address the matter. One such effort is the use of material generated in the dredging of navigational canals; however, this material is low in nutrient value, making the regeneration of marsh grasses more difficult. In addition, bottomland hardwood forests and coastal wetland grasses are excellent 'carbon sinks' because they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in living plant tissue. Entergy Services, Inc. is an electric utility with a service territory that comprises portions of both the Lower Mississippi River Valley and the Gulf of Mexico coastline. This provides an opportunity to positively address both habitat losses noted above while at the same time addressing global warming, forest fragmentation, and biodiversity. Entergy, through its affiliation with the UtiliTree Carbon Company, is participating in projects that will investigate the feasibility of using bottomland hardwood reforestation on cleared marginal farmlands now managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Entergy has also begun a research project with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Louisiana. The research is a compost demonstration project that will utilize wood waste generated through our tree-trimming program as a compost material that will be mixed with low nutrient dredge material to create new coastal wetlands. Taken together, Entergy's initiatives will be able to address global warming through carbon sequestration, restore fragmented forest habitats, reduce coastal erosion and improve the quality of a vital coastal aquatic nursery habitat. Efforts will be made to manage the created habitats for biodiversity. Pulling all these ideas together creates an effect in which the whole is greater than the sum, of the parts. In such a synergy of ideas, there are no losers and the winners are both industry participants and the environment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.",1
"The use of fossil fuels in transportation is an important topic as a result of growing concerns over global warming. Automobile petrol demand has been of particular interest to researchers and policy-makers, given that the automobile is a major contributor to the enhanced greenhouse effect. This paper forecasts Australia's automobile petrol demand up to the year 2020 based on the best performing forecasting model selected out of eight models. In order to establish ways to reduce the demand for petrol, and the consequent by-product of reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, we have estimated the impact on CO2 for several potential policy instruments, using Transportation and Environment Strategy Impact Simulator (an integrated transport, land use and environmental strategy impact simulation programme). We find that a carbon tax of AU$0.50/kg can reduce automobile kilometres by 5.9%, resulting in reduced demand for petrol and a reduction in CO2 of 5%.",1
"Instrumental records indicate that ocean volumes during the 20th century have increased so as to raise eustatic sea level by similar to1-2 mm/year and the few available records suggest that this is higher than for the previous century. Geological data indicate that ocean volumes have increased since the main phase of deglaciation about 7000 years ago but whether this continued into the recent past remains unclear. Yet, this is important for establishing whether the recent rise is associated with global warming or is part of a longer duration non-anthropogenic signal. Here, we present results for sea-level change in the central Mediterranean basin for the Roman Period using new archaeological evidence. These data provide a precise measure of local sea level of -35 +/- 0.07 m at 2000 years ago. Part of this change is the result of ongoing glacio-hydro isostatic adjustment of the crust subsequent to the last deglaciation. When corrected for this, using geologically constrained model predictions, the change in eustatic sea level since the Roman Period is -0.13 +/- 0.09 m. A comparison with tide-gauge records from nearby locations and with geologically constrained model predictions of the glacio-isostatic contributions establishes that the onset of modem sea-level rise occurred in recent time at similar to100 +/- 53 years before present.

"Among the methods that are being developed to date for CO(2) capture and separation, carbon dioxide adsorption is of great interest due to its low energy consumption, low equipment cost and easiness for application. In this work, a simple method which is easier than existing approaches requiring more complicated and longer computations is presented to accurately predict the carbon dioxide adsorption isotherms for a microporous material as a function of temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The method appears promising and can be extended for CO(2) capture as well as for separation of wide range of adsorbents and microporous materials including several molecular sieves merely by the quick readjustment of tuned coefficients. The proposed method showed consistently accurate results across the proposed pressure and temperature ranges. Predictions showed an average absolute deviation of 4% compared to existing Sips and Langmuir equations which show an average absolute deviations of 2.3% and 4%, respectively. The proposed method is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly for various cases. This simple-to-use approach can be of immense practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on adsorption capacities of a given adsorbent at various temperatures and pressures without the necessity of any experimental measurements. In particular, personnel dealing with regulatory bodies of greenhouse gas control and process industries would find the proposed approach to be user friendly involving transparent calculations with no complex expressions.

"The fast diminution of readily extractable sources of fossil fuels, particularly oil, and concerns about global warming are leading to the creation of many new potential fuels. Their practicability must be assessed in terms of a wide range of physico-chemical properties, in relation to the operational aerodynamics in different engines. This article concentrates on those properties related to combustion and these are discussed in detail for some fuels with contrasting properties. Intrinsic fuel properties include volumetric energy, vapour pressure, heat of reaction, latent enthalpy of vaporization, and the relative volumes of energy that engines can breathe. Important combustion properties include the minimum ignition energy, laminar burning velocity, Markstein numbers for strain and curvature, flame extinction stretch rates for positive and negative stretch, stretch factor for flame instability, turbulent flame burning and quenching, autoignition delay time, excitation time for autoignition heat release, research and motor octane numbers and cetane number (CN). Such properties are manifest in a variety of aerodynamic contexts: for example, the nature of autoignition depends on spatial reactivity gradients and the acoustic speed. Particular problems can arise in characterizing engine knock when operational regimes are outside those in which the octane and CNs are determined. The approach adopted in this article does not assume any unique alignment between fuels, mode of combustion, and power unit, and different possibilities are discussed.",1
"How big a threat is global warming to climate-sensitive and economically important sectors such as agriculture in developing countries? How well will farmers be able to adapt to the threats of global warming? This paper attempts to shed light on these two important questions. A cross-sectional analysis is employed to estimate the climate sensitivity of agriculture in Brazil and India. Using panel data from both countries, the study measures how net farm income or property values vary with climate, and consequently, how farmers in India and Brazil react and adapt to climate. The estimated relationships are then used to predict the consequence of alternative climate scenarios. Global warming by the end of the next century could cause annual damages in Brazil between 1% and 39% and between 4% and 26% in India, although some of this effect may be potentially offset by carbon fertilization. These estimates do not factor into account climate-induced extreme weather events. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from animal feeding operations to the atmosphere are of environmental importance and concerns because of their impact on global warming. Gaseous concentrations and emission rates (ERs) of animal facilities can be affected by the animal production stages, animal species, dietary nutrition, housing types, manure handling schemes, and environmental conditions. This article reports ERs of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) for a typical, naturally ventilated 24-crate swine farrowing barn located in suburban Beijing, China, that was monitored over one-year period. The measurements were made at bi-monthly intervals (i.e., six measurement episodes total), with each measurement episode covering three consecutive days. Gaseous concentrations were monitored at bi-hourly intervals throughout each 3-day measurement episode. The ventilation rate of the barn was estimated using the CO2 mass balance method. The GHG concentrations and ERs of the farrowing barn showed diurnal and seasonal variations. Specifically, the concentrations (monthly mean +/-SD, mg m(-3)) ranged from 2.3 (+/- 0.3) to 9.3 (+/- 2) for CH4, from 0.6 (+/- 0.02) to 2 (+/- 0.16) for N2O, and from 1,370 (+/- 163) to 11,100 (+/- 950) for CO2, with the higher levels occurring in January and the lower levels in July. The specific ER ranged from 95.2 to 268 rag h(-1) pig(-1) for CH4, from 6.4 to 12.9 mg h(-1) pig(-1), for N2O, and from 122.9 to 127.3 g h(-1) pig(-1) for CO2. On the basis of per animal unit (1 AU = 500 kg live body mass), the average daily ERs of the farrowing barn were 9.6 +/- 3.6 gAU(-1) d(-1) for CH4, 0.54 +/- 0.15 gAU(-1) d(-1) for N2O, and 7.5 +/- 0.1 kg AU(-1) d(-1) for CO2. Results of the GHG ERs from this study differ markedly from the limited literature data collected primarily under European production systems and conditions. Results of the current study provide some baseline data on GHG ERs for swine farrowing operations, thus contributing to development or improvement of GHG emission inventory under the Chinese livestock production conditions.",1
"Agriculture's share including all direct and indirect processes such as clearing of forests in the tropics in anthropogenic global warming potential is about more than 30%. When the inappropriate cultivation methods and land use changes in the tropic and subtropic areas, which cause especially high CO2-emissions, are excluded agriculture's share is about 13%, now methane emissions (from livestock husbandry and rice paddies) and nitrous oxide emissions (due to nitrogen inputs to the soils) are predominating. In Austria agriculture's share in national warming potential is about 10%. If only emissions in direct connection with agricultural land use (incl. fuel consumption, use of mineral and organic N-fertilizers and use of plant protective agents, but excl. emissions from livestock husbandry and from use of electricity power, gas and fuel oil for heating) are included agriculture's share is about 5%. In the past specialization in agricultural production resulting in unbalanced crop rotations and intensification of soil cultivation might have contributed to degradation of organic carbon on arable land. However, topsoils are still an important carbon reservoir, which must be preserved by competent and sustainable soil cultivation (well balanced crop rotation,planting of cover crops, incorporation of crop residues in the soil). Agriculture may contribute a relevant amount to reduce emissions of climate affecting trace gases when the potential for biomass production is used. Extensification strategies in all fields of plant production should be further optimised for preserving natural resources and using energy inputs efficiently.",1
"One of the most prominent applications to increase agricultural yield is the application of nitrogenous fertilizers to the soil. The intermediate and final products of the mineralization/humidification include carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) are released into the atmosphere while other final products are cycled into the soil upon completion of the related reactions that take place in soil. Released CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)O are the most notable factors responsible for global warming and are claimed to be remarkably serious When one accounts for all of the agricultural lands and other similar fields all around the globe. In the present study, the impact of NH(4)NO(3) with 26% N, which consisted of 19% NH(4)-N (ammonium-N) and 7% NO(3)-N (nitrate-N), with and without nitrification inhibitor in the soil on CH(4), CO(2) and N(2)O gas emissions was monitored in a controlled laboratory environment as three parallel experiments. The amount of fertilizer applied to the soil layer was 90 kg N per hectare. The two treated soils and one control soil were incubated at 60% maximal water holding capacity at 25 degrees C during the test period of 18 days to investigate, (a) nitrogenous fertilizer (NH(4)NO(3)), (b) nitrogenous fertilizer phis nitrification inhibitor (NH(4)NO(3) + N.I.), and finally (c) control for CH(4), CO(2), and N(2)O emissions. Gas compositions from the experimental soils were sampled at predetermined times in order to assess the CH(4) release along with N(2)O and CO(2) emissions. Analyses of the headspace on the 1(st), 2(nd), 4(th), 7(th), 10(th), 14(th) and 18(th) days were completed in order to evaluate gas concentrations. The overall results indicate that NH(4)NO(3) fertilization and NH(4)NO(3) with a nitrification inhibitor application causes a statistically significant decrease in CH(4) emissions and an increase in CO(2) emissions into the atmosphere. N(2)O emissions were found to be statistically different with the NH(4)NO(3) application and control treatments. Yet, no significant change was observed in, the N(2)O concentrations with respect to nine, based oil the NH(4)NO(3) with a nitrification inhibitor application compared to the control group.",1
"Examining tropical regional precipitation anomalies under global warming in 10 coupled global climate models, several mechanisms are consistently found. The tendency of rainfall to increase in convergence zones with large climatological precipitation and to decrease in subsidence regions-the rich-get-richer mechanism-has previously been examined in different approximations by Chou and Neelin, and Held and Soden. The effect of increased moisture transported by the mean circulation (the ""direct moisture effect'' or ""thermodynamic component'' in respective terminology) is relatively robust, while dynamic feedback is poorly understood and differs among models. The argument outlined states that the thermodynamic component should be a good approximation for large-scale averages; this is confirmed for averages across convection zones and descent regions, respectively. Within the convergence zones, however, dynamic feedback can substantially increase or decrease precipitation anomalies. Regions of negative precipitation anomalies within the convergence zones are associated with local weakening of ascent, and some of these exhibit horizontal dry advection associated with the ""upped-ante'' mechanism. Regions of increased ascent have strong positive precipitation anomalies enhanced by moisture convergence. This dynamic feedback is consistent with reduced gross moist stability due to increased moisture not being entirely compensated by effects of tropospheric warming and a vertical extent of convection. Regions of reduced ascent with positive precipitation anomalies are on average associated with changes in the vertical structure of vertical velocity, which extends to higher levels. This yields an increase in the gross moist stability that opposes ascent. The reductions in ascent associated with gross moist stability and upped-ante effects, respectively, combine to yield reduced ascent averaged across the convergence zones. Over climatological subsidence regions, positive precipitation anomalies can be associated with a convergence zone shift induced locally by anomalous heat flux from the ocean. Negative precipitation anomalies have a contribution from the thermodynamic component but can be enhanced or reduced by changes in the vertical velocity. Regions of enhanced subsidence are associated with an increased outgoing longwave radiation or horizontal cold convection. Reductions of subsidence are associated with changes of the vertical profile of vertical velocity, increasing gross moist stability.",1
"For transport purposes a great amount of fossil fuels is exploited which represents the biggest threat to global warming and the realization of sustainable development concept. European Union is trying to implement and plan this concept on the entire European continent. In order to manage the sustainable development strategy, it is necessary to conduct an all-inclusive analysis of the current state and depending on the results, set some goals and define the activities that will make their realization possible. This research is based on the analysis of the waterway transport on Danube River and its aim is to point out the facts, based on which it will be possible to predict further directions of sustainable transport development on the most important waterway of Europe. The research indicates the basic rules of European politics of sustainable inland waterway development. The River Danube is considered to be the backbone of water transport in Europe. It connects, via Rhine - Main Canal, Western Europe and Rotterdam harbor with the Black Sea, that is with Russia and the East. The authors also analyse the data about the use of Danube waterway for transport of goods This research covered a short description of Danube, the analysis of Danube fleet, the analysis of the amount of transported goods as well as the analysis of load and unload of goods. The research covered these points in the period starting from the year of 1950. Based on the result analysis the authors arrived at a conclusion that the use of River Danube for waterway transport purposes is unsatisfactory and that as such cannot be sustained in long term. Also, the research points to the basic European initiatives and investment projects in the field of river transport which is in implementation stage. Considering the basic regulation documents and research results, the authors present an overview of measures and suggestions for efficient management conducted so far, development of a unique information system and promotion of Danube waterway, which will lead towards long-term sustainable development transport on Danube and so it will stimulate a stable and sustainable development of all countries and regions in Europe.",1
"The impacts of global climate change on forest distribution was evaluated using the Holdridge life zone and GISS general circulation model scenarios. Across Zimbabwe, 17 to 18% of the total land area is projected to shift from subtropical thorn woodland and subtropical dry forest to tropical very dry forest under the GISS scenario. The projected shift in forest distribution is attributable to a future decline in precipitation patterns and an increase in ambient temperature.",1
"In this study, we performed an assessment of the environmental impact caused by the use of Spanish roads from 2004 to 2006. Subsequently, through the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, this impact was compared with the construction stage of roads, considering the following impact categories: global warming, formation of tropospheric ozone precursors and acidification. The results show the progressive increase of the emissions of the pollutants that cause global warming. Moreover, the importance of the environmental impact associated to the construction stage is reflected.",1
"Climate modelers have recognized the possibility of abrupt climate changes caused by a reorganization of the North Atlantic's current pattern (technically known as a thermohaline circulation collapse). This circulation system now warms north-western Europe and transports carbon dioxide to the deep oceans. The posited collapse of this system could produce severe cooling in northwestern Europe, even when general global warming is in progress. In this paper we use a simple integrated assessment model to investigate the optimal policy response to this risk. Adding the constraint of avoiding a thermohaline circulation collapse would significantly reduce the allowable greenhouse gas emissions in the long run along an optimal path. Our analysis implies that relatively small damages associated with a collapse (less than 1% of gross world product) would justify a considerable reduction of future carbon dioxide emissions.",1
"Feedback between global carbon (C) cycles and climate change is one of the major uncertainties in projecting future global warming. Coupled carbon-climate models all demonstrated a positive feedback between terrestrial C cycle and climate warming. The positive feedback results from decreased net primary production (NPP) in most models and increased respiratory C release by all the models under climate warming. Those modeling results present interesting hypotheses of future states of ecosystems and climate, which are yet to be tested against experimental results. In this study, we examined ecosystem C balance and its major components in a warming and clipping experiment in a North America tallgrass prairie. Infrared heaters have been used to elevate soil temperature by approximately 2 degrees C continuously since November 1999. Clipping once a year was to mimic hay or biofuel feedstock harvest. On average of data over 6 years from 2000 to 2005, estimated NPP under warming increased by 14% without clipping (P < 0.05) and 26% with clipping (P < 0.05) in comparison with that under control. Warming did not result in instantaneous increases in soil respiration in 1999 and 2000 but significantly increased it by approximately 8% without clipping (P < 0.05) from 2001 to 2005. Soil respiration under warming increased by 15% with clipping (P < 0.05) from 2000 to 2005. Warming-stimulated plant biomass production, due to enhanced C(4) dominance, extended growing seasons, and increased nitrogen uptake and use efficiency, offset increased soil respiration, leading to no change in soil C storage at our site. However, biofuel feedstock harvest by biomass removal resulted in significant soil C loss in the clipping and control plots but was carbon negative in the clipping and warming plots largely because of positive interactions of warming and clipping in stimulating root growth. Our results demonstrate that plant production processes play a critical role in regulation of ecosystem carbon-cycle feedback to climate change in both the current ambient and future warmed world.",1
"The field of photonics starts with the efficient generation of light. The generation of efficient yet highly controllable light can indeed be accomplished with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are, in principle, capable of generating white light with a 20 times greater efficiency than conventional light bulbs. Deployed on a global scale to replace conventional sources, such solid-state light sources will result in enormous benefits that, over a period of 10 years, include (1) gigantic energy savings of 9 x 10(20) joule, (2) a very substantial reduction in global-warming CO2 emissions, (3) a strong reduction in the emission of pollutants such as acid-rain-causing SO2, mercury (Hg), and uranium (U), and (4) financial savings exceeding a trillion (10(12)) US$. These benefits can be accomplished by the ""replacement paradigm"" in which conventional light sources are replaced by more energy efficient, more durable, and non-toxic light sources. However, it will be shown that solid-state light sources can go beyond the replacement paradigm, by providing new capabilities including the control of spectrum, color temperature, polarization, temporal modulation, and spatial emission pattern. We will show that such future, ""smart"" light sources, can harness the huge potential of LEDs by offering multi-dimensional controllability that will enhance the functionality and performance of light sources in a wide range of applications. These applications include optical microscopy, imaging, display technologies, communications, networking, and transportation systems. (C) 2008 Optical Society of America",1
"The main point of this paper is that we, with or without climate change as a driving force, should expect to see major surprises both in energy and energy technologies in the decades to year 2050. If antropogenic climate change emerge as a major and global driving force, the likelihood for CO2-sequestration.(for electricity and hydrogen production) to take a share of the energy market is quite high. Catastrophic scenarios based on the whole fossil fuel reserve being burned and emitted to the atmosphere is not realistic.",1
"Global circulation models predict an increase of summer monsoon precipitation in High Asia as a consequence of global warming. The shortness of available meteorological records requires the reconstruction of past climate variability. However, high-resolution climate proxy records from the Tibetan plateau are scarce and of limited spatial representativeness. Here we present first evidence of increased summer monsoon intensity from the Tibetan plateau based on reconstructions of late summer ( August and September) temperature and rainfall from a network of 22 maximum latewood density (MLD) chronologies of high-elevation conifer sites. After 1980, a decrease in MLD points to an increase of Indian summer monsoon activity ( in southern Tibet unprecedented during the past 350 years.",1
"We examined climate-carbon cycle feedback by performing a global warming experiment using MIROC-based coupled climate-carbon cycle model. The model showed that by the end of the 21st century, warming leads to a further increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) level of 123 ppm by volume (ppmv). This positive feedback can mostly be attributed to land-based soil-carbon dynamics. On a regional scale, Siberia experienced intense positive feedback, because the acceleration of microbial respiration due to warming causes a decrease in the soil carbon level. Amazonia also had positive feedback resulting from accelerated microbial respiration. On the other hand, some regions, such as western and central North America and South Australia, experienced negative feedback, because enhanced litterfall surpassed the increased respiration in soil carbon. The oceanic contribution to the feedback was much weaker than the land contribution on global scale, but the positive feedback in the northern North Atlantic was as strong as those in Amazonia and Siberia in our model. In the northern North Atlantic, the weakening of winter mixing caused a reduction of CO2 absorption at the surface. Moreover, weakening of the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water caused reduced CO2 subduction to the deep water. Understanding such regional-scale differences may help to explain disparities in coupled climate-carbon cycle model results.",1
"Material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA), along with characteristics of regional MFA, were applied to analyze fossil fuels flow in Hubei's economy system from 1991 to 2003. An internationally comparative study on material intensity and efficiency of fossil fuels was presented to illustrate their environmental impacts on Hubei province. The study shows that material efficiency of fossil fuels in Hubei was close to the average level in China, but far lower than that in the developed countries. Global warming potential (GWP) was the greatest one and occupied 44% of total environmental impact. Therefore, the key pathway to reduce environmental pollution was to improve the utilizing efficiency of fossil fuels, and to control the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.",1
"We present several equilibrium runs under varying atmospheric CO(2) concentrations using the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM). The model shows two very different responses: for CO(2) concentrations of 400 ppm or lower, the system evolves into an equilibrium state. For CO(2) concentrations of 440 ppm or higher, the system starts oscillating between a state with vigorous deep water formation in the Southern Ocean and a state with no deep water formation in the Southern Ocean. The flushing events result in a rapid increase in atmospheric temperatures, degassing of CO(2) and therefore an increase in atmospheric CO(2) concentrations, and a reduction of sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean. They also cool the deep ocean worldwide. After the flush, the deep ocean warms slowly again and CO(2) is taken up by the ocean until the stratification becomes unstable again at high latitudes thousands of years later. The existence of a threshold in CO(2) concentration which places the UVic ESCM in either an oscillating or non-oscillating state makes our results intriguing. If the UVic ESCM captures a mechanism that is present and important in the real climate system, the consequences would comprise a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of several tens of ppm, an increase in global surface temperature of the order of 1-2 degrees C, local temperature changes of the order of 6 degrees C and a profound change in ocean stratification, deep water temperature and sea ice cover.",1
"Conservative estimates of global warming suggest that average daily temperature may be raised by 0.5-5 degrees C by the middle of the next century. This would have an impact on agricultural and horticultural production in the U.K., and may result in a changing distribution of crops and the introduction of crops which cannot currently be grown in the U.K. The effect of a warmer climate on navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and vining peas (Pisum sativum) was studied with the aid of a heat unit model. Total thermal receipt for the current and a warmer climate over the growing season of navy beans is compared with thermal requirement (sowing to crop maturity) of the crop. The analysis suggested that parts of Southern England would become thermally suitable for navy bean production, given relatively little global warming (0.5 degrees C). For vining peas, the contraction of the harvesting period due to a warmer climate, with a resulting increase of risk of a lost crop, is examined by using an accumulated day degree time scale from the start of harvest to the time when the crop is too mature. This analysis indicated that the time available for vining pea harvesting (determined by tenderometer values) may decrease by up to 25 per cent, which would significantly increase the risks in harvesting at the optimum time in traditional production areas. It is suggested that growing vining pea crops at more northerly latitudes than currently would help to compensate for the tendency of increased warming to reduce the period for which the crop could be harvested at optimum maturity.",1
"The world's soils contain a large amount of carbon so that even a fractionally small loss or gain could have a quantitatively important feedback effect on net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. It is therefore important to fully understand the temperature dependence of soil-carbon decomposition. Evidence from various observations can be used to quantify the temperature dependence of carbon efflux, but it is important to ensure that confounding factors, such as changing water relations or availability of readily decomposable substrate, are fully considered in inferring an underlying temperature response from observed response patterns. A number of recent findings from soil-warming experiments have led to the suggestion that stimulation of soil-carbon efflux by increasing temperature is only transitory before acclimation takes place and carbon efflux rates return to similar rates as before the increase in temperature. It is shown here that this response pattern can be explained through a simple two-pool soil-carbon model with no acclimation response needing to be invoked. The temporal pattern is, instead, due to depletion of readily decomposable substrate. It shows that findings of reduced respiration rate in soil-warming experiments are consistent with unchanged high temperature sensitivity of organic carbon decomposition and affirms that there is, indeed, a danger of positive feedback between global warming and the release of soil organic carbon that can lead to further warming.",1
"India has vast tracts of wastelands. Afforestation of these wastelands is one of the many alternative uses of such lands. Given the scarcity of capital in India, it becomes imperative to determine the economics and financial feasibility of wastelands afforestation projects. The studies reviewed in this paper deal with cost and financial feasibility analysis of wastelands afforestation projects in India. The main rationale behind this review is to examine the prospects of increasing investments in the afforestation projects. This also has a global significance, since afforestation augments carbon sequestration, which has become an exigency in view of externalities associated with global warming. The study uses review of existing literature and regression analysis as analytical tools. The review reveals that reclamation of wastelands through afforestation is not an expensive venture in India. Afforestation projects are financially viable even when no environmental benefits are taken into consideration. The results of the study suggest that polluting companies/countries should explore the possibility of investing in afforestation in India to gain carbon credits economically, once the parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change decide to approve it. The studies reviewed reveal that researchers have used different sets of criteria for financial feasibility analysis of the afforestation projects. Almost all the studies have ignored non-market benefits of afforestation projects. Such methodological differences need to be addressed in view of the increasing importance of plantations as carbon sinks. Some socioeconomic issues like investment in tree crops vis-a-vis agricultural crops, preference for mixed plantation and wastelands development as a means of resource development have also emerged from this review.",1
"The current success of the diesel engine is undoubtedly linked to the remarkable trade-off between performance and fuel economy that this offers to customers. Therefore, the necessary reduction of tail pipe pollutant emissions, such as nitrogen oxides and soot, must not threaten this contribution to reducing the global warming effect by unacceptable after treatment costs. By achieving a low temperature lean combustion, the HCCI allows generation of a very small amount of particles and NOx and therefore may avoid the need of a NOx trap for the main vehicle applications. Its success depends on the ability to control noise and hydrocarbon emissions at part load as well as to allow high power and torque densities. The aims of this paper are to show clearly how the injection strategy could have a positive effect on the engine results and to point Out the main difficulties which are still to be solved.",1
"As a clean energy carrier, hydrogen has attracted global attention in recent years, because it could address issues that are related to reducing global climate change. It has to be stipulated that to date's processes for hydrogen production using fossil fuels need to be coupled with CO2 separation and storage. Thermally and hydrothermally stable microporous membranes with intrinsic high H-2/CO2 selectivity are highly demanded in steam-reforming and water gas-shift processes for H-2 gas separation. In this study a composite alumina-titania membrane was synthesized by the combination of atomic layer deposition (ALD) and sol-gel processes. By adjusting the number of ALD cycles (280 cycles), a thin TiO2 layer corresponding to a thickness of similar to 10 nm was deposited on the surface of gamma-Al2O3 membranes. The gas permeation was tested to assess the membranes' gas separation performance. The membranes exhibited a good balance between H-2 permeance and separation properties. At 450 K, the H-2 permeance is approximately 12.5 x 10(-8) mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-1 and the separation factor is 5.8 for a H-2/CO2 mixture. The results clearly demonstrate that the studied deposition method ALD is a promising route to prepare ceramic microporous membranes for hydrogen separation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Global warming is the most important science issue of the 21st century, challenging the very structure of our global society. The study of past climate has shown that the current global climate system is extremely sensitive to human-induced climate change. The burning of fossil fuels since the beginning of the industrial revolution has already caused changes with clear evidence for a 0.75 degrees C rise in global temperatures and 22 cm rise in sea level during the 20th century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report (2007) predicts that global temperatures by 2100 could rise by between 1 degrees C and 6.4 degrees C. Sea level could rise by between 28 cm and 79 cm, more if the melting of the polar ice caps accelerates. In addition, weather patterns will become less predictable and the occurrence of extreme climate events, such as storms, floods, heat waves and droughts, will increase. The potential effects of global warming on human society are devastating. We do, however, already have many of the technological solutions to cure our sick planet.",1
Steelmaking based on natural gas rather than coal is proposed as a logical solution to concerns about climate change and global warming. Highly preheated iron ore fines are fed onto the surface of the molten iron carrier medium in a single loop melt circulation reactor. A thin layer of liquid iron ore is formed and reduction occurs as the molten iron oxide containing melt is transported along the length of the reduction arm countercurrent to natural gas in situ generated reducing gases flowing at high velocity. Issues relating to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are addressed and detailed consideration is given to soot formation and its subsequent gasification in the bulk gas phase. Key parameters for 1 Mtpa liquid steel are evaluated based on thermal decomposition of methane by convective heat transfer and reduction of ferrous oxide controlled by gaseous diffusion. A breakdown of capital and operating costs indicates the relative importance of key elements.,1
"The growth and dynamics of plankton in the ocean vary with natural cycles, global climate change and the long-term evolution of ecosystems. The ocean is a large reservoir for CO2 and the food webs in the upper ocean play critical roles in regulating the global carbon cycle, changes in atmospheric CO2 and associated global warming. Microheterotrophs are a key component of the upper ocean food webs. Here, we report on the results of an analysis of the distribution of bacteria and related properties in the World Ocean. We found that, for the data set as a whole, there is a significant latitudinal gradient in all field-measured and computed bacterial properties, except growth rate. Gradients were, for the most part, driven by an equator-ward increase in the Southern Hemisphere. The biomass, rates of production and respiration and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were significantly higher in the Northern than the Southern hemispheres. In contrast, growth rates were the same in the two hemispheres. We conclude that the lower biomass and production in the Southern Hemisphere reflects greater top-down control by microbial grazers, which would be due to a lower abundance or activity of omnivorous zooplankton in the Southern than Northern Hemispheres. These large spatial differences in dynamics, structure and activity of the bacterial community and the microbial food web will be reflected in different patterns of carbon cycling, export and air-sea exchange of CO2 and the potential ability of the ocean to sequester carbon.",1
"In this paper, an assessment method is proposed for ecodesign improvement options using global warming and economic performance indicators. A reduction in the GHG emissions in the entire life cycle stages of a product was chosen as the global warming performance of the product The external cost which converts the external effect of global warming into a monetary value was chosen as the global warming performance indicator in order to measure the performance of the GHG reduction of the product. The life cycle cost (LCC) of the product was chosen as the economic performance indicator to measure the performance of the life cycle cost reduction of the product. The assessment method based on the two performance indicators was applied to the liquid crystal display (LCD) panel for a case study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"A time-slice global warming experiment was performed with a very high-resolution (20-km mesh) atmospheric general circulation model. Due to increased horizontal resolution, land-sea distribution over the Indonesian Maritime Continent is well represented. A clear contrast in precipitation change at the end of the twenty-first century is found over Borneo Island and the Java Sea: over the ocean morning precipitation decreases and evening precipitation increases, while over the island morning precipitation increases, resulting in reduced amplitude of rainfall diurnal variation over both land and ocean. Weakened land-sea breeze circulation by global warming due to larger nighttime temperature increases over land than during the day contributes to this decreased rainfall diurnal variation.",1
"Agricultural production is thought to be a main anthropogenic emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O), which contributes to global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer. There is still considerable uncertainty about the amount of N2O emission, and the site-specific parameters that affect N2O emission. From October 1995 until March 1998 experiments were conducted at established field plots (true meadows) at three different sites, i.e. low mountain range (Eifel), lowland (Niederrhein), and moist meadows (Munsterland). Plots were fertilized with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) at nitrogen equivalents ranging from 0 to 360 kg N ha(-1). N2O fluxes were measured throughout the whole year using the closed-chamber method. In addition, data on temperature, water-filled pore space and precipitation were collected. N2O emission rates (mg N2O-N ha(-1) h(-1)) were highest either after fertilizer application or in winter during frost, depending on the experimental site and N dosage. The annual amount of N losses clue to N2O emission was dependent on the experimental site and the type and dosage of fertilizer. Disregarding the 360 kg N ha (1) level of the CAN treatments, the N losses in this experiment were less than 5 kg N2O-N ha (1) yr (1). At low fertilizer dosage there was no reliable correlation between the amount of N that was applied and the amount of N2O that was emitted. However, with high fertilizer levels the N2O emissions increased gradually. Finally, N2O emissions were more influenced by the amount of CAN than by the site.",1
"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most important gases in the atmosphere, and is necessary for sustaining life on Earth. It is also considered to be a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and climate change. In this article, energy consumption in Bangladesh is analyzed and estimates are made of CO2 emission from combustion of fossil fuel (coal, gas, petroleum products) for the period 1977 to 1995. International Panel for Climate Change guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories were used in estimating CO2 emission. An analysis of energy data shows that the consumption of fossil fuels in Bangladesh is growing by more than 5% per year. The proportion of natural gas in total energy consumption is increasing, while that of petroleum products and coal is decreasing. The estimated total CO2 release from all primary fossil fuels used in Bangladesh amounted to 5072 Gigagram (Gg) in 1977, and 14 423 Gg in 1995. The total amounts of CO2 released from petroleum products natural gas, and coal in the period 1977-1995 were 83 026 Gg (50% of CO2 emission), 72 541 Gg (44% of CO2 emission), and 9545 Gg (6% CO2 emission), respectively. A trend in CO2 emission with projections to 2070 is generated. In 2070, total estimated CO2 emission will be 293 260 Gg with a current growth rate of 6.34% y(-1). CO2 emission from fossil fuels is increasing. Petroleum products contribute the majority of CO2 emission load, and although the use of natural gas is increasing rapidly, its contribution to CO2 emission is less than that of petroleum products. The use of coal as well as CO2 emission from coal is expected to gradually decrease.",1
"This manuscript reviews and compares the results of recent greenhouse gas (GHG) emission life-cycle analyses. Specific attention is paid to fossil energy technologies, nuclear and renewable energy technologies (RETs), as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and energy storage systems. Analysing up- and downstream processes and their associated GHG emissions, which arise upstream and downstream of the power plant (i.e., electricity generation stage), is important; otherwise, the GHG emissions resulting from electricity generation of the various fuel options are underestimated. For fossil fuel technology options upstream GHG emission rates can be up to 25% of the direct emissions from the power plant, whereas for most RETs and nuclear power upstream and downstream GHG emissions can account for way over 90% of cumulative emissions. In economies where carbon is being priced or GHG emissions constrained, this may provide an advantage to technologies with trans-boundary upstream emissions over technologies without significant life-cycle emissions arising outside the legislative boundaries of GHG mitigation policies. It is therefore desirable for GHG emissions under national, regional and international mitigation policies to be accounted for over its entire life-cycle. The results presented here indicate that the most significant GHG avoidance (in absolute terms) can be made from technology substitution. The introduction of advanced fossil fuel technologies can also lead to improvements in life-cycle GHG emissions. Overall, hydro, nuclear and wind energy technologies can produce electricity with the least life-cycle global warming impact. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Reduction of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation is being considered a cost-effective way of mitigating the impacts of global warming. If such reductions are to be implemented, accurate and repeatable measurements of forest cover change and biomass will be required. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), which has one of the world's largest remaining areas of tropical forest, we used the best available data to estimate rainforest carbon stocks, and emissions from deforestation and degradation. We collated all available PNG field measurements which could be used to estimate carbon stocks in logged and unlogged forest. We extrapolated these plot-level estimates across the forested landscape using high-resolution forest mapping. We found the best estimate of forest carbon stocks contained in logged and unlogged forest in 2002 to be 4770 Mt (+/- 13%). Our best estimate of gross forest carbon released through deforestation and degradation between 1972 and 2002 was 1178 Mt ( +/- 18%). By applying a long-term forest change model, we estimated that the carbon loss resulting from deforestation and degradation in 2001 was 53 Mt (+/- 18%), rising from 24 Mt ( +/- 15%) in 1972. Forty-one percent of 2001 emissions resulted from logging, rising from 21% in 1972. Reducing emissions from logging is therefore a priority for PNG. The large uncertainty in our estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes is primarily due to the dearth of field measurements in both logged and unlogged forest, and the lack of PNG logging damage studies. Research priorities for PNG to increase the accuracy of forest carbon stock assessments are the collection of field measurements in unlogged forest and more spatially explicit logging damage studies.

"Global climate change is a growing concern among many policy makers. This concern has led to substantial interest in using forests as one option to mitigate climate change. In this article, the effect of internalizing carbon sequestration benefits on the optimal management of slash pine plantations is explored. Results suggest that without carbon bene is, it is optimal to use herbicide and bedding but not fertilizer because the increase in timber yield does notjustib7 the high cost offertilizer. With carbon benefits, however, the use of fertilizer becomes profitable. Thus a carbon market would likely induce plantation owners to increase their management intensity, which may in turn also have significant impacts on the amount of carbon sequestered. For example, by allowing the management regime to vary in addition to rotation age, the amount of carbon sequestered decreased from 204 to 164 metric tons of carbon per acre when carbon prices increased from $40 to $200 per metric ton. Thus increasing carbon sequestration on the intensive margin may be less feasible than previously supposed, but increasing on the extensive margin may be highly practicable.",1
"Human alteration of the environment has arguably propelled the Earth into its sixth mass extinction event and amphibians, the most threatened of all vertebrate taxa, are at the forefront. Many of the worldwide amphibian declines have been caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and two contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain these declines. Positive correlations between global warming and Bd-related declines sparked the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis, which proposes that global warming increased cloud cover in warm years that drove the convergence of daytime and nighttime temperatures toward the thermal optimum for Bd growth. In contrast, the spatiotemporal-spread hypothesis states that Bd-related declines are caused by the introduction and spread of Bid, independent of climate change. We provide a rigorous test of these hypotheses by evaluating (i) whether cloud cover, temperature convergence, and predicted temperature-dependent Bid growth are significant positive predictors of amphibian extinctions in the genus Atelopus and (ii) whether spatial structure in the timing of these extinctions can be detected without making assumptions about the location, timing, or number of Bd emergences. We show that there is spatial structure to the timing of Atelopus slop. extinctions but that the cause of this structure remains equivocal, emphasizing the need for further molecular characterization of Bd. We also show that the reported positive multi-decade correlation between Atelopus slop. extinctions and mean tropical air temperature in the previous year is indeed robust, but the evidence that it is causal is weak because numerous other variables, including regional banana and beer production, were better predictors of these extinctions. Finally, almost all of our findings were opposite to the predictions of the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis. Although climate change is likely to play an important role in worldwide amphibian declines, more convincing evidence is needed of a causal link.",1
"For many species in seasonal environments, warmer springs associated with anthropogenic climate change are causing phenological changes. Within ecological communities, the timing of interactions among species may be altered if the species experience asymmetrical phenological shifts. We present a model that examines the consequences of changes in the relative timing of herbivory and pollination in a community of herbivores and pollinators that share a host plant. Our model suggests that phenological shifts can alter the abundances of these species and, in some cases, their population dynamics. If historical patterns of interactions in a community change and herbivores become active before pollinators, the community could see a reduction in pollinators and an increase in herbivores, while if pollinators become active before herbivores, there could be a loss of stable coexistence. Previous studies have warned of the potential for climate change to cause large phenological mismatches whereby species that depend on one another become so separated in time that they can no longer interact. Our results suggest that climate change-induced phenological shifts can have a major impact on communities even in cases where complete phenological mismatches do not occur. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Forests help mitigate climate change by sequestering atmospheric carbon. However, boreal and high-latitude temperate forests may also contribute to global warming due to the albedo effect. The relative effects of carbon sequestration and albedo can be quantified in terms of radiative forcing. We present a stylized, stand-level analysis to determine the optimal rotation age when considering a tax/subsidy scheme based on radiative forcing and the notion of equivalent carbon emissions. Additional management decision variables considered include species choice and regeneration effort, since these can impact the albedo effect. We demonstrate analytically that the optimal rotation length is likely shortened when albedo-related equivalent emissions are incorporated, relative to a policy based only on carbon. Empirical results indicate that rotation ages do decrease relative to a ""carbon only"" policy, and approach the traditional (timber only) Faustmann rotation age as equivalent emission rates increase. Our results suggest that forestation does not necessarily provide climatic benefits in all circumstances, and that. at the margin, other opportunities for carbon reduction (e.g. abatement), or pursuing forestation in other locations, become more attractive.

"On the basis of the climate scenarios downscaled to Hungary from the IPCC Report (IPCC, 2007) by Bartholy et al. (2007), we performed sensitivity analyses on air temperature in maize canopy. We created the scenario for 2071-2100 by using Goudriaan's (1977) simulation model (Crop Microclimate Simulation Model, CMSM). We selected eight scenarios including the control (1961-1990), one of them examined the changes of the past decade, another one did the impacts of the doubled atmospheric CO(2) concentration. The remaining five scenarios contained different degrees of warming-up beside the doubled atmospheric CO(2) concentration as it follows: scenarios with +3.8, +4.8, +6.0, and two ones with +9.0 degrees C; the latter two differed only in the quantity of precipitation. Each approach increased the air temperature in maize canopy depending on the degree of warming-up. The changes already occurring in the environmental factors in the past decade increased the air temperature at cob level by 0.6 degrees C. The presence of plant canopy, however, mitigated the degree of warming-up, likely owing to the shadowing effect of the canopy. We should not ignore the fact that the compensating effect of the canopy depends on the canopy structure determined by the humidity supply. The analysis results made available local level information for the potential users that can provide apparent help in the preparation for the mitigation of adverse impacts of the expected changes.",1
"Background, aim, and scope Carbon footprint (CF) has become a hot topic as public awareness of climate change is placing demands on manufacturers to declare the climate impact of their products. Calculating the CF of food products is complex and associated with unavoidable uncertainty due to the inherent variability of natural processes. This study quantifies the uncertainty of a common food product and discusses the results in relation to different types of CF systems for food product labelling. Materials and methods A detailed LCI with global warming potential as the only impact category was performed on King Edward table potatoes grown in the Ostergotland region of Sweden. Parameters were described using one probability distribution for spatial and temporal variation and one separate distribution describing measuring/data uncertainty, allowing the effect of parameter resolution on CF uncertainty to be studied. Monte Carlo simulation was used to quantify the overall uncertainty. The influence of individual parameters on the CF was analysed and differences in CF for food products from different production systems, with and without climate impact reduction rules, were simulated. Results The potato CF fell in the range 0.10-0.16 kg CO(2)e per kilogram of potatoes with 95% certainty for an arbitrary year and field. Emissions of N(2)O from soil dominated the CF uncertainty. Locking the temporal variation to a specific year lowered the uncertainty range by 19%. Parameter collection on a spatial scale of one field did not reduce the uncertainty. The most sensitive parameters were the yield, the soil humus content and the emissions factors for N(2)O emissions from soil. Potatoes grown according to climate rules lowered the CF by 9% with a probability of 53% for an arbitrary year and field. Discussion The importance of yield, which proved to be the most influential parameter, is a common characteristic of agricultural products in general, since the accumulated emissions from a cultivated area are divided across the yield from that area. Maximising the yield reduces the CF but could have negative impacts on other environmental aspects. The purpose of the CF labelling scheme, together with uncertainty analysis, needs to be considered when determining how the CF should be calculated, as an average or for a specific year, farm, field, region, etc. Conclusions The CF of a potato crop calculated for an arbitrary year and field varied between approximately -17% and +30% of the average value with 95% certainty, showing that uncertainty analysis in the design, calculation and evaluation of food product CF labelling schemes is important to ensure fair comparisons. Recommendations and perspectives Similar studies comparing different production systems for the same type of product and products from different categories, on large and small scale depending on the purpose of the CF system, are needed in order to determine how the CF of food products can be compared and the precision with which data have to be collected in order to allow fair and effective comparison of the CF of food products.",1
"The Kyoto Protocol represents an initial step in terms of solving the problem of global climate change. However, as with most first steps, the Kyoto Protocol must be followed by a full journey in order to reach the desired goal of preventing catastrophic global warming. The Kyoto Protocol does not lead to the necessary decline in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly because emissions of developing countries are not specifically addressed in the Protocol. We suggest a new agreement based on carbon taxes as a possibility to build upon the Kyoto Protocol and eventually freeze atmospheric concentrations at a level that prevents catastrophic climate change.

"An intensive study reconstructs the local late-Holocene tree-limit history (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa) in the southern Swedish Scandes, as a proxy palaeoclimatic indicator. Elevational tree-limit rise by 75 m, in accordance with instrumentally recorded summer warming, took place over the past century as evidenced by a combination of historical records and modern age-structure analyses. This regionally representative development was put into long-term perspective by radiocarbon-dating of a large sample of megafossil wood remains (trunks and roots), preserved and recovered at the same location and elevation as the new and higher tree-limit. The magnitude and rate of 20th century tree-limit advance (implicitly climate warming) were without precedent for the past ca. 3500 calendar years. The course of development conforms to an increasingly emergent worldwide pattern, suggesting that warming over the past century is a fundamental reversal of along-tern (Neoglacial) cooling trend. The results are of relevance for current efforts to attribute causes of recent warming in terms of natural versus anthropogenic forcing. The highly anomalous nature of the past century, with respect to climate and ecological change, could argue that at least in part, the warming may be human-induced. However, definite conclusions have to await more global-scale data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.",1
"The response of the Southern Hemisphere (SH), extratropical, atmospheric general circulation to transient, anthropogenic, greenhouse warming is investigated in a coupled climate model. The extratropical circulation response consists of a SH summer half-year poleward shift of the westerly jet and a year-round positive wind anomaly in the stratosphere and the tropical upper troposphere. Along with the poleward shift of the jet, there is a poleward shift of several related fields, including the belt of eddy momentum-flux convergence and the mean meridional overturning in the atmosphere and in the ocean. The tropospheric wind response projects strongly onto the model's ""Southern Annular Mode'' (also known as the ""Antarctic oscillation''), which is the leading pattern of variability of the extratropical zonal winds.",1
"We use a simple methodology to test whether a set of atmospheric climate models with prescribed radiative forcings and ocean surface conditions can reproduce twentieth century climate variability. Globally, rapid land surface warming since the 1970s is reproduced by some models but others warm too slowly. In the tropics, air-sea coupling allows models to reproduce the Southern Oscillation but its strength varies between models. We find a strong relationship between the Southern Oscillation in global temperature and the rate of global warming, which could in principle be used to identify models with realistic climate sensitivity. This relationship and a weak response to ENSO suggests weak sensitivity to changes in sea surface temperature in some of the models used here. In the tropics, most models reproduce part of the observed Sahel drought. In the extratropics, models do not reproduce the observed increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation in response to forcings, through internal variability, or as a combination of both.",1
"Hydrogen has captured the imagination of the technical community recently, with visions of improved energy security, reduced global warming, improved energy efficiency and reduced air pollution as potential benefits. A significant ""Hydrogen Economy"" is predicted that will reduce dependence on petroleum imports, and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.(1) Such a hydrogen economy will need significant new sources of hydrogen. Virtually all our current hydrogen is produced from natural gas and is equivalent to 48 GW(t). Replacing this growing demand with a non-fossil, non-greenhouse gas emitting source represents a huge potential market for fusion.",1
"The Arctic climate is governed by complex interactions and feedback mechanisms between the atmosphere, ocean, and solar radiation. One of its characteristic features, the Arctic sea ice, is very vulnerable to anthropogenically caused warming. Production and melting of sea ice is influenced by several physical processes. The authors show that the northward ocean heat transport is an important factor in the simulation of the sea ice extent in the current general circulation models. Those models that transport more energy to the Arctic show a stronger future warming, in the Arctic as well as globally. Larger heat transport to the Arctic, in particular in the Barents Sea, reduces the sea ice cover in this area. More radiation is then absorbed during summer months and is radiated back to the atmosphere in winter months. This process leads to an increase in the surface temperature and therefore to a stronger polar amplification. The models that show a larger global warming agree better with the observed sea ice extent in the Arctic. In general, these models also have a higher spatial resolution. These results suggest that higher resolution and greater complexity are beneficial in simulating the processes relevant in the Arctic and that future warming in the high northern latitudes is likely to be near the upper range of model projections, consistent with recent evidence that many climate models underestimate Arctic sea ice decline.",1
"The Elikah River section in the Alborz Mountains (North Iran) is a fossiliferous, continuous, marine section spanning the Permian-Triassic (P T) boundary interval. Sixty-eight taxa of brachiopods, foraminifers and algae have been collected bed-by-bed from the topmost 36 m of the Nesen Formation and the basal 2 m of the Elikah Formation, across the P-T boundary that is located in the basal metre of the latter formation. Forty-six of these taxa from 62 samples have been considered for statistical analyses to unravel the pattern of extinction. First, their range extensions have been determined, which should be added to the highest stratigraphic occurrence of each taxon to identify the extinction level within a certain confidence interval (95%). Then the pattern of the extinction has been analysed, plotting the stratigraphic abundance versus last occurrence below the extinction horizon. The resulting pattern is of a sudden extinction occurring 30 cm below the biostratigraphically defined base of the Triassic. The confidence interval (95%) for the mass extinction is 30 cm thick. As predicted by the 'Signor-Lipps effect', brachiopod last occurrences underestimate the time of extinction, as their abundance is below 15%. Therefore, also in North Iran located at equatorial palaeolatitudes along the southern shore of the Palaeotethys Ocean, the pattern of the latest Permian mass extinction is abrupt as observed in South China, in peri-Gondwana and in the Southern Alps. One of the most plausible mechanisms of the latest Permian sudden mass extinction could have been the emissions of tholeiitic magmas (Siberian Traps), which could have caused greenhouse gases emission into the atmosphere and thus global warming and ozone depletion, triggering the crisis (Svensen et al. 2008).

"Climate change may dramatically affect the distribution and abundance of organisms. With the world's population size expected to increase significantly during the next 100 years, we need to know how climate change might impact our food production systems. In particular, we need estimates of how future climate might alter the distribution of agricultural pests. We used the climate projections from two general circulation models (GCMs) of global climate, the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis GCM (CGCM2) and the Hadley Centre model (HadCM3), for the A2 and B2 scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios in conjunction with a previously published bioclimatic envelope model (BEM) to predict the potential changes in distribution and abundance of the swede midge, Contarinia nasturtii, in North America. The BEM in conjunction with either GCM predicted that C. nasturtii would spread from its current initial invasion in southern Ontario and northwestern New York State into the Canadian prairies, northern Canada, and midwestern United States, but the magnitude of risk depended strongly on the GCM and the scenario used. When the CGCM2 projections were used, the BEM predicted an extensive shift in the location of the midges' climatic envelope through most of Ontario, Quebec, and the maritime and prairie provinces by the 2080s. In the United States, C. nasturtii was predicted to spread to all the Great Lake states, into midwestern states as far south as Colorado, and west into Washington State. When the HadCM3 was applied, southern Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Washington State were not as favourable for C. nasturtii by the 2080s. Indeed, when used with the HadCM3 climate projections, the BEM predicted the virtual disappearance of 'very favourable' regions for C. nasturtii. The CGCM2 projections generally caused the BEM to predict a small increase in the mean number of midge generations throughout the course of the century, whereas, the HadCM3 projections resulted in roughly the same mean number of generations but decreased variance. Predictions of the likely potential of C. nasturtii spatial spread are thus strongly dependent on the source of climate projections. This study illustrates the importance of using multiple GCMs in combination with multiple scenarios when studying the potential for spatial spread of an organism in response to climate change.",1
"Algae containing 30-75% of lipid by dry basis can be called oilgae. All microalgac species produce lipid however some species can contain up to 70% of their dry weight. Microalgae appear to be the only source of renewable biodiesel that is capable of meeting the global demand for transport fuels. Biodiesel production by using oilgac is an alternative process in contrast to other procedures not only being degradable and non-toxic but also as a solution to global warming via reducing emission gases. Algae-based technologies could provide a key tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and other carbon intensive industrial processes. Because algae are rich in oil and can grow in a wide range of conditions, many companies are betting that it can create fuels or other chemicals cheaper than existing feedstocks. The aim of microalgae biofixation of CO2 is to operate large-scale systems that are able to convert a significant fraction of the CO2 outputs from a power plant into biofuels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Global climate change affects spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation and so has a major impact on surface and subsurface water balances. While global climate models are designed to describe climate change on global or continental scales, their resolution is too coarse for them to he suitable for describing regional climate change. Therefore, regional climate models are applied to downscale the coarse meteorological fields to a much higher spatial resolution to take account of regional climate phenomena. The changes of atmospheric state due to regional climate change must be translated into surface and sub-surface water fluxes so that the impact on water balances in specific catchments can be investigated. This can be achieved by the coupled regional climatic/hydrological simulations presented here. The non-hydrostatic regional climate model MCCM was used for dynamic downscaling for two time slices of a global climate model Simulation with the GCM ECHAM4 (IPCC scenario IS92a, 'business as usual) from 2.8 degrees x 2.8 degrees to 4 x 4 km(2) resolution for the years 1991-1999 and 203 1-2039. This allowed derivation of detailed maps showing changes in precipitation and temperature in a region of southern Germany and the central Alps. The performance of the downscaled ECHAM4 to reproduce the seasonality of precipitation in central Europe for the recent climate was investigated by comparison with dynamically downscaled ECMWF reanalyses in 20 x 20 km2 resolution. The downscaled ECHAM4 Fields underestimate precipitation significantly in summer. The ratio of mean monthly downscaled ECHAM4 and ECMWF, precipitation showed little variation. so it was used to adjust the course of precipitation for the ECHAM4/MCCM fields before it was applied in the hydrological model. The high resolution meteorological fields were aggregated to 8-hour time steps and applied to the distributed hydrological model WaSiM to simulate the water balance of the alpine catchment of the river Ammer (c. 700 km(2)) at 100 x 100 m(2) resolution. To check the reliability of the Coupled regional climatic/hydrological simulation results for the recent climate, they were compared with those of a station-based hydrological simulation for the period 1991-1999. This study shows the changes in the temperature and precipitation distributions in the catchment from the recent climate to the future climate scenario and how these will affect the frequency distribution of runoff.",1
"Research into technology for removal of CO2 considered to be the major cause of global warming, was applied to electric power plant flue gas. Our method was to use zeolite as adsorbent for physical adsorption, progressing from the previously used PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) method to the more advanced PTSA (Pressure and Temperature Swing Adsorption) method. We have been conducting basic research since the 1980s, and in 1991 built a 1000m(3)N/h scale pilot plant, where we are continuing research through trial operation. Trial operation of the pilot plant has been mainly for acquisition of scale up data, as well as improvement in the decrease in the power consumption of PTSA units. As a result, we have seen a better than 20% improvement in that area. In addition, the pilot plant completed 2000 hours of continuous operation without incident between October and December, 1994. The total hours of operation of the plant have topped 4000 hours, but we have seen no decrease in the effectiveness of the CO2 adsorbent. The SOx in the flue gas was trapped in the lower part of desiccant in PSA-H2O before the process. Some of desiccant reacts to that, but we have prevented any ill effects on the process that might be caused by main units. At this point we would like to report on the results of our research, as well as outline our plants for the future.",1
"This study investigates the regional responses of a climate model to the gradual increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 1% per year compounded for quadrupling. Use of NCAR fully coupled Climate System Model (CSM2) is attempted, with special emphasis on the simulated sea-level changes in the neighbouring seas of the northwestern Pacific Ocean with an enhanced resolution. Regional warming and sea level change are higher than global changes. At the time Of CO2 quadrupling, the model predicts a rise in sea level of 19 cm and 25 cm for the globe and the northwestern Pacific Ocean, respectively, while surface air temperature rises are 2.9degreesC and 3.0degreesC for the globe and the northwestern Pacific Ocean, respectively. Based on simulations, climate changes in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean will be more distinctive compared with the global average, mainly due to exceptionally large warming and sea level change near the entrance of the Kuroshio extension.",1
"The world needs to develop a coherent and practical approach to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recently confirmed that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal; meanwhile, an effort is under way to develop a successor to the Kyoto Protocol and provide a roadmap towards the lower carbon world of the future. On the other hand, biomass energy refers to the use of plant and other organic materials to provide desired forms of energy and energy services, such as heat, light, and motive power. Since the discovery of fire, it has been a major source of energy worldwide. Even in today's fossil fuel era, biomass provides about 11% of the world's total primary energy supply.

Biomass is used to meet a variety of energy needs, including generating electricity, heating homes, fueling vehicles, and providing process heat for industrial facilities.",1
"The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate(1). About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems(2), but this absorption is sensitive to climate(3,4) as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations(5), creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change(6). Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We rnd that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt Cyr(-1) is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models(2), resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.",1
"The strategy of exploiting photosynthesizing microalgal cultures to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from flue gases through fixation has potential in effectively diminishing the release Of CO2 to the atmosphere, helping alleviate the trend toward global warming. The use of fiberoptic-based solar concentrating systems for microalgal photobiorectors has the potential to meet the two essential criteria in the design of a lighting system for algal photobioreactors: (1) electrical energy efficiency; and (2) lighting distribution efficiency. The overall efficiencies of solar concentrating systems have significantly improved in recent years, exceeding 45%. Meanwhile, achieving uniform lighting distribution within photobioreactors constitutes probably the greatest challenge in using fiberoptic-based solar concentrators as a lighting system for photobioreactors. The light-emitting fibers appeared to be a most promising candidate in achieving such uniform light distribution in photobioreactors. Also, when a hybrid-solar-and-electric-lighting scheme is adopted to augment solar lighting whenever needed, the hybrid lighting distribution needs to be designed accordingly.",1
"The spectre of anthropogenic global climate change has focused attention on biogeochemical cycling in the oceans as marine plankton ecosystems are involved in the cycling of several compounds thought to have significant implications for climate. To better understand these processes, modellers are developing plankton functional type (PFT) models that group plankton according to their biogeochemical properties. There is some debate as to whether our understanding of plankton ecosystems is sufficiently well developed for PFT models to be reliable and for their predictions to be treated with confidence. In this paper, we examine the dynamical properties of a generic predator-prey-prey PFT model, then apply these analysis techniques to a simple example PFT model with two phytoplankton and one zooplankton in order to explore its parameter space. We find that parameter combinations for which all PFTs stay extant for all time appear rare, but develop a simple heuristic that allows such parameter sets to be identified relatively easily for many PFT models. We observe that such systems often have phytoplankton with similar growth rates, but that differ in other properties such as differing nutrient utilization strategies or different susceptibilities to grazing. We also note that persistent PFT systems are more likely if neither phytoplankton have a low specific mortality rate or is a highly nutritious food for the grazer.",1
"Global warming is becoming a reality, with growing evidence that anthropogenic activity on our planet is starting to influence our climate (IPCC, 2001). Due to the increase in significant weather-related disasters in recent years, it is important to investigate the role of global warming on such changes. In this paper we attempt to estimate the long term trends in lightning activity over tropical Africa during the past 50 years, using upper tropospheric water vapor as a proxy for regional lightning activity. We use the NCAR/NCEP reanalysis product available for the period 1948 to the present to estimate the long term trends in lightning activity. Similarity between the long term African lightning variability and observed rainfall and river discharge variability are demonstrated. Since 1950 the inferred lightning activity over Africa shows significant variability, reaching a maximum during the 1960s, followed by a decrease in activity during the following 30 years.",1
"The environmental implications of including structural changes in a wastewater treatment plant to decrease effluent concentrations of nitrogen were evaluated in this study. Environmental effects from these structural changes were assessed by using the Life Cycle Assessment theoretical framework. The wastewater treatment plant selected as a reference scenario had an activated sludge configuration. The Ludzack-Ettinger and Oxidation Ditch configurations were selected as modifications of the reference scenario. Results from this study show that the inclusion of nitrogen removal mechanisms in the configuration of the plant reduces the effect of the plant on the eutrophication, but simultaneously increases the effect on the consumption of abiotic resources, global warming, acidification and human toxicity. These general trends, however, vary depending on the configuration selected to remove nitrogen. Taking all the impacts together, the Oxidation Ditch configuration would cause less environmental impact than the Ludzack-Ettinger configuration, given the characteristics of the selected scenarios.

"Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetland ecosystems is a relatively new issue in global climate change studies. China has approximately 22% of the world's rice paddies and 38% of the world's rice production, which are crucial to accurately estimate the global warming potential (GWP) at regional scale. This paper reports an application of a biogeochemical model (DeNitrification and DeComposition or DNDC) for quantifying GWP from rice fields in the Tai-Lake region of China. For this application, DNDC is linked to a 1:50,000 soil database, which was derived from 1107 paddy soil profiles compiled during the Second National Soil Survey of China in the 1980-1990s. The simulated results show that the 2.34 Mha of paddy soil cultivated in rice-wheat rotation in the Tai-Lake region emitted about -48 Tg C, 0.84 Tg N and 5.67 Tg C as CO2, N2O, and CH4 respectively, with a cumulative GWP of 565 Tg CO2 equivalent from 1982 to 2000. As for soil subgroups, the highest GWP (26,900 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) yr(-1)) was linked to gleyed paddy soils accounting for about 4.4% of the total area of paddy soils. The lowest GWP (5370 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) yr(-1)) was associated with submergenic paddy soils accounting for about 0.32% of the total area of paddy soils. The most common soil in the area was hydromorphic paddy soils, which accounted for about 53% of the total area of paddy soils with a GWP of 12,300 kg CO2 equivalent ha(-1) yr(-1). On a regional basis, the annual averaged GWP in the polder, Tai-Lake plain, and alluvial plain soil regions was distinctly higher than that in the low mountainous and Hilly soil regions. As for administrative areas, the average annual GWP of counties in Shanghai city was high. Conversely, the average annual GWP of counties in Jiangsu province was low. The high variability in soil properties throughout the Tai-Lake region is important and affects the net greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the use of detailed soil data sets with high-resolution digital soil maps is essential to improve the accuracy of GWP estimates with process-based models at regional and national scales.

"The development of more efficient processes for CO2 capture from the flue streams of power plants is considered a key to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions implicated in global warming. Indeed, several U.S. and international climate change initiatives have identified the urgent need for improved materials and methods for CO2 capture. Conventional CO2 capture processes employed in power plants world-wide are typically postcombustion ""wet scrubbing"" methods involving the absorption of CO2 by amine-containing solvents such as methanolamine (MEA). These present several disadvantages, including the considerable heat required in regeneration of the solvent and the necessary use of inhibitors for corrosion control, which lead to reduced efficiencies and increased costs for electricity production. This perspective article seeks to highlight the most recent advances in new materials for CO2 capture from power plant flue streams, with particular emphasis on the rapidly expanding field of metal organic frameworks. Ultimately, the development of new classes of efficient, cost-effective, and industrially viable capture materials for application in carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems offers an immense opportunity to reduce atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases on a national and international scale.",1
"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the main factors involved in pollution control and global warming in industrialized nations. Various treatment methods involving incineration, adsorption, etc., were employed to reduce VOCs concentration. Various absorbents, such as activated carbon, zeolite, silica gel or alumina, and so on were broadly used to adsorb VOCs in various industrial applications. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was handled to analyze the thermal characteristics of absorbents. Typically, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used to evaluate the structure variation of absorbents under high temperature situations. In view of pollution control and loss prevention, versatility and analysis of recycled adsorbents are necessary and useful for various industrial applications.",1
"Recent studies suggest a reduction of primary production in the tropical oceans because of changes in oceanic circulation under global warming conditions caused by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. This might affect the productivity of medium and higher trophic levels with potential consequences on marine resources such as tropical tuna. Here we combine the projections of up-to-date climate and ocean biogeochemical models with recent concepts of representation of fish habitat based on prey abundance and ambient temperature to gain some insight into the impact of climate change on skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis), the species that dominates present-day tuna catch. For a world with doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration, our results suggest significant large-scale changes of skipjack habitat in the equatorial Pacific. East of the date line, conditions could be improved by an extension of the present favourable habitat zones of the western equatorial Pacific, a feature reminiscent of warming conditions associated with El Nino events. Despite its simplicity and the associated underlying hypothesis, this first simulation is used to stress future research directions and key issues for modelling developments associated to global change.",1
"Many studies have been conducted to quantify the possible ecosystem/landscape response to the anticipated global warming. However, there is a large amount of uncertainty in the future climate predictions used for these studies. Specifically, the climate predictions can be very different based on a variety of global climate models and alternative greenhouse emission scenarios. In this study, we coupled a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and a forest process model, PnET-II, to examine the uncertainty (that results from the uncertainty in the future climate predictions) in the forest-type composition prediction for a transitional forest landscape [the Boundary Water Canoe Area]. Using an improved global-sensitivity analysis technique [Fourier amplitude sensitivity test], we also quantified the amount of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction contributed by different climate variables including temperature, CO2, precipitation and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). The forest landscape response was simulated for the period 2000-2400 ad based on the differential responses of 13 tree species under an ensemble of 27 possible climate prediction profiles (monthly time series of climate variables). Our simulations indicate that the uncertainty in the forest-type composition becomes very high after 2200 ad, which is close to the time when the current forests are largely removed by windthrow disturbances and natural mortality. The most important source of uncertainty in the forest-type composition prediction is from the uncertainty in temperature predictions. The second most important source is PAR, the third is CO2 and the least important is precipitation. Our results also show that if the optimum photosynthetic temperature rises due to CO2 enrichment, the forest landscape response to climatic change measured by forest-type composition may be substantially reduced.",1
"El Nino events, characterized by anomalous warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, have global climatic teleconnections and are the most dominant feature of cyclic climate variability on subdecadal timescales. Understanding changes in the frequency or characteristics of El Nino events in a changing climate is therefore of broad scientific and socioeconomic interest. Recent studies(1-5) show that the canonical El Nino has become less frequent and that a different kind of El Nino has become more common during the late twentieth century, in which warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central Pacific are flanked on the east and west by cooler SSTs. This type of El Nino, termed the central Pacific El Nino (CP-El Nino; also termed the dateline El Nino(2), El Nino Modoki(3) or warm pool El Nino(5)), differs from the canonical eastern Pacific El Nino (EP-El Nino) in both the location of maximum SST anomalies and tropical-midlatitude teleconnections. Here we show changes in the ratio of CP-El Nino to EP-El Nino under projected global warming scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model data set(6). Using calculations based on historical El Nino indices, we find that projections of anthropogenic climate change are associated with an increased frequency of the CP-El Nino compared to the EP-El Nino. When restricted to the six climate models with the best representation of the twentieth-century ratio of CP-El Nino to EP-El Nino, the occurrence ratio of CP-El Nino/EP-El Nino is projected to increase as much as five times under global warming. The change is related to a flattening of the thermocline in the equatorial Pacific.",1
"Large-scale changes in land cover affect nearsurface energy, moisture and momentum fluxes owing to changes in surface structure (referred to as biogeophysical effects) and the atmospheric CO2 concentration owing to changes in biomass (biogeochemical effects). Here we quantify the relative magnitude of these processes as well as their synergisms by using a coupled atmosphere-biosphere-ocean model of intermediate complexity. Our sensitivity studies show that tropical deforestation tends to warm the planet because the increase in atmospheric CO2 and hence, atmospheric radiation, outweighs the biogeophysical effects. In mid and high northern latitudes, however, biogeophysical processes, mainly the snow-vegetation-albedo feedback through its synergism with the sea-ice-albedo feedback, win over biogeochemical processes, thereby eventually leading to a global cooling in the case of deforestation and to a global warming, in the case of afforestation.",1
"This paper examines how South American farmers' choices of livestock species vary across the range of climate and in turn infer from them as to what would happen under climate changes. We examine the choice of five primary species using a multinomial logit model with and without climate variability measures based on 1300 livestock farm surveys in seven countries. The results indicate that climate variables are highly significant determinants of primary species choice after controlling for soils, geography, household characteristics, and country fixed effects. We find the probability of adopting any livestock increases with warming, but decreases when it becomes too wet. The impacts of climate change would vary by species and climate scenarios. For example, under a hot and dry CCC scenario by 2060, beef cattle decrease by 3.2%, dairy cattle by 2.3%, pigs by 0.5%, and chickens by 0.9%, which is offset by a large increase in sheep by 7%. These adaptive changes vary again by country. Large changes are observed in the Andean countries. Under the hot dry scenario, daily cattle increase in Uruguay and Argentina, but decrease elsewhere. The increase in sheep occurs mostly in the Andes mountain countries such as Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Under a milder and wetter scenario, beef cattle choice declines in Colombia. Ecuador, and Venezuela, but increases in Argentina and Chile. Sheep increase in Colombia and Venezuela, but decrease in the high mountains of Chile where chickens are chosen more frequently.

"This paper reports work done three years ago for the Highways Agency in England to stimulate long-term thinking about how to develop and operate the strategic highway network in the UK. The effects of road traffic are becoming a critical problem throughout the world, and without some radical solutions the situation is forecast to get worse. Problems such as traffic congestion, global warming and how to achieve sustainability are politically sensitive yet require positive action. Innovative thinking is needed now to develop solutions and actions that are good for the long term. The Highways Agency in its role as network operator is responsible for managing, maintaining and improving the strategic road network in England-over 8000 km of motorways and trunk roads. In a bid to look beyond the usual 5-10 year planning cycle, the Highways Agency commissioned the Vision 2030 Project. Visioning techniques and innovative thinking were used to develop several possible scenarios and propositions for the long-term future of inter-urban transport. These transport visions have influenced the Highways Agency in developing suitable action plans to achieve the desired levels of service for users of the strategic road network, against a changing and challenging background.",1
"Methanoplanus petrolearius Ollivier et al. 1998 is the type strain of the genus Methanoplanus. The strain was originally isolated from an offshore oil field from the Gulf of Guinea. Members of the genus Methanoplanus are of interest because they play an important role in the carbon cycle and also because of their significant contribution to the global warming by methane emission in the atmosphere. Like other archaea of the family Methanomicrobiales, the members of the genus Methanoplanus are able to use CO2 and H-2 as a source of carbon and energy; acetate is required for growth and probably also serves as carbon source. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. This is the first complete genome sequence of a member of the family Methanomicrobiaceae and the sixth complete genome sequence from the order Methanomicrobiales. The 2,843,290 bp long genome with its 2,824 protein-coding and 57 RNA genes is a part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project.",1
"Targets for stabilizing climate change are often based on considerations of the impacts of different levels of global warming, usually assessing the time of reaching a particular level of warming. However, some aspects of the Earth system, such as global mean temperatures(1) and sea level rise due to thermal expansion(2) or the melting of large ice sheets(3), continue to respond long after the stabilization of radiative forcing. Here we use a coupled climate-vegetation model to show that in turn the terrestrial biosphere shows significant inertia in its response to climate change. We demonstrate that the global terrestrial biosphere can continue to change for decades after climate stabilization. We suggest that ecosystems can be committed to long-term change long before any response is observable: for example, we find that the risk of significant loss of forest cover in Amazonia rises rapidly for a global mean temperature rise above 2 degrees C. We conclude that such committed ecosystem changes must be considered in the definition of dangerous climate change, and subsequent policy development to avoid it.",1
"Increased CO2 release from soils resulting from agricultural practices such as tillage has generated concerns about contributions to global warming, Maintaining current levels of soil C and/or sequestering additional C in soils are important mechanisms to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere through production agriculture. We conducted a study in northern Alabama from 2003 to 2006 to measure CO2 efflux and C storage in long-term tilled and non-tilled cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plots receiving poultry litter or ammonium nitrate (AN). Treatments were established in 1996 on a Decatur silt loam (clayey, kaolinitic thermic, Typic Paleudults) and consisted of conventional-tillage (CT), mulch-tillage (MT), and no-tillage (NT) systems with winter rye [Secale cereale (L.)] cover cropping and AN and poultry litter (PL) as nitrogen sources. Cotton was planted in 2003, 2004, and 2006. Corti was planted in 2005 as a rotation crop using a no-till planter in all plots, and no fertilizer was applied. Poultry litter application resulted in higher CO2 emission from soil compared with AN application regardless of tillage system. In 2003 and 2006, CT (4.39 and 3.40 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively) and MT (4.17 and 3.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively) with, PL at 100 kg N ha(-1) (100 PLN) recorded significantly higher CO2 efflux compared with NT with 100 PLN (2.84 and 2.47 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Total soil C at 0- to 15-cm depth was not affected by tillage but significantly increased with PL application and winter rye cover cropping. In general, cotton, produced with NT conservation tillage in conjunction with PL and winter rye cover cropping reduced CO2 emissions and sequestered more soil C compared with control treatments.",1
"During the 20th century, farmers around the world replaced legume rotations and other traditional sources of nitrogen (N) fertility with synthetic N fertilizers. A sizable percentage of the human population now depends on synthetic N fertilizers for survival. In recent decades, N fertilizers have been linked to numerous environmental hazards including marine eutrophication, global warming, groundwater contamination, and stratospheric ozone destruction. Some researchers suggest that legumes, which can support biological NZ fixation, offer a more environmentally sound and sustainable source of N to cropping systems. This perspective is countered by researchers who argue that, (1) legume-derived N has equally negative environmental impacts as the N derived from synthetic fertilizers, and (2) the human population now exceeds the carrying capacity of agricultural systems that depend on legumes for N inputs. In this review, we compare the sustainability of obtaining N from legume versus industrial sources in terms of ecological integrity, energetics and food security. We conclude that obtaining N from legumes is potentially more sustainable than from industrial sources. We further suggest that while some countries are fundamentally dependent on synthetic N for food production, many countries have the capacity to greatly reduce or eliminate dependence on synthetic N through adoption of less meat-intensive diets, and reduction of food waste.

" Agricultural lime can be a source or a sink for CO2, depending on whether reaction occurs with strong acids or carbonic acid. Here we examine the impact of liming on global warming potential by comparing the sum of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to carbonate alkalinity in soil solutions beneath unmanaged vegetation versus limed row crops, and of streams and rivers in agricultural versus forested watersheds, mainly in southern Michigan. Soil solutions sampled by tension indicated that lime can act as either a source or a sink for CO2. However, infiltrating waters tended to indicate net CO2 uptake, as did tile drainage waters and streams draining agricultural watersheds. As nitrate concentrations increased in infiltrating waters, lime switched from a net CO2 sink to a source, implying nitrification as a major acidifying process. Dissolution of lime may sequester CO2 equal to roughly 25 - 50% of its C content, in contrast to the prevailing assumption that all of the carbon in lime becomes CO2. The similar to 30 Tg/yr of agricultural lime applied in the United States could thus sequester up to 9 TgC/ yr, about 15% of the annual change in the U. S. CO2 emissions (12 Tg C/yr for 2002 - 2003). The implications of liming for atmospheric CO2 stabilization should be considered in strategies to mitigate global climate change.",1
"A life cycle assessment has been completed of potential biogas infrastructures on a regional scale. Centralised and distributed infrastructures were considered along with biogas end uses of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and injection to the gas grid for either transport fuel or domestic heating end uses. Damage orientated (endpoint) life cycle impact assessment method identified that CHP with 80% heat utilisation had the least environmental impact, followed by transport fuel use. Utilisation for domestic heating purposes via the gas grid was found to perform less well. A 32% difference in transportation requirement between the centralised and distributed infrastructures was found to have a relatively small effect on the overall environmental impact. Global warming impacts were significantly affected by changes in methane emissions at upgrading stage, highlighting the importance of minimising operational losses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"General Circulation Models (GCMs) have been developed to assess the impacts of potential global climate change. However, these models do not provide specific weather information at the whole-plant level and thus provide only very gross estimates of conditions that affect plant and disease development. Also, climatic change may increase the frequency of extreme events that influence plant production more than changes in daily or monthly averages. One solution is a simulation approach that can scale weather information from the global down to the plant scale. Over the last 4 years, we have been developing methods to hierarchically define current and forecast weather conditions down to the whole-plant level based on nested high-resolution atmospheric (mesoscale) numerical models. Two hierarchical mesoscale model approaches were tested to downscale weather data in a vineyard. The first, known as the Localized Mesoscale Forecast System (LMFS) uses surface databases to 'localize' mesoscale output. The second, known as the Canopy-Mesoscale Forecast System (CMFS), uses a boundary layer model to downscale mesoscale output. To illustrate the utility of this approach we focused on surface wetness duration (SWD), a variable with high spatial and temporal variability. SWD is also a critical variable for prediction of plant disease. Simulations of SWD with on-site input data were compared to those derived from the mesoscale models and to on-site sensors. Forecasts of atmospheric variables by the two systems were compared to on-site observations. Success in this effort leads us to extend this method to GCMs where factors such as temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and surface wetness can be estimated within plant and crop canopies. We explore the implications of this work on evaluating the assessment of climate change on the risk of plant disease development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Hurricanes can inflict catastrophic property damage and loss of human life. Thus, it is important to determine how the character of these powerful storms could change in response to greenhouse gas-induced global warming. The impact of climate warming on hurricane intensities was investigated with a regional, high-resolution, hurricane prediction model. In a case study, 51 western Pacific storm cases under present-day climate conditions were compared with 51 storm cases under high-CO2 conditions, More idealized experiments were also performed. The large-scale initial conditions were derived from a global climate model. For a sea surface temperature warming of about 2.2 degrees C, the simulations yielded hurricanes that were more intense by 3 to 7 meters per second (5 to 12 percent) for wind speed and 7 to 20 millibars for central surface pressure.",1
"Quantitative evaluations of the impacts of climate change on water resources are primarily constrained by uncertainty in climate projections from GCMs. In this study we assess uncertainty in the impacts of climate change on river discharge in two catchments of the Yangtze and Yellow River Basins that feature contrasting climate regimes (humid and semi-arid). Specifically we quantify uncertainty associated with GCM structure from a subset of CMIP3 AR4 GCMs (HadCM3, HadGEM1, CCSM3.0, IPSL, ECHAM5, CSIRO, CGCM3.1), SRES emissions scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, B2) and prescribed increases in global mean air temperature (1 degrees C to 6 degrees C). Climate projections, applied to semi-distributed hydrological models (SWAT 2005) in both catchments, indicate trends toward warmer and wetter conditions. For prescribed warming scenarios of 1 degrees C to 6 degrees C, linear increases in mean annual river discharge, relative to baseline (19611990), for the River Xiangxi and River Huangfuchuan are + 9% and 11% per + 1 degrees C respectively. Intra-annual changes include increases in flood (Q05) discharges for both rivers as well as a shift in the timing of flood discharges from summer to autumn and a rise (24 to 93%) in dry season (Q95) discharge for the River Xiangxi. Differences in projections of mean annual river discharge between SRES emission scenarios using HadCM3 are comparatively minor for the River Xiangxi (13 to 17% rise from baseline) but substantial (73 to 121%) for the River Huangfuchuan. With one minor exception of a slight (-2%) decrease in river discharge projected using HadGEM1 for the River Xiangxi, mean annual river discharge is projected to increase in both catchments under both the SRES A1B emission scenario and 2 degrees rise in global mean air temperature using all AR4 GCMs on the CMIP3 subset. For the River Xiangxi, there is substantial uncertainty associated with GCM structure in the magnitude of the rise in flood (Q05) discharges (-1 to 41% under SRES A1B and -3 to 41% under 2 degrees global warming) and dry season (Q95) discharges (2 to 55% under SRES A1B and 2 to 39% under 2 degrees global warming). For the River Huangfuchuan, all GCMs project a rise in the Q05 flow but there is substantial uncertainty in the magnitude of this rise (7 to 70% under SRES A1B and 2 to 57% under 2 degrees global warming). Differences in the projected hydrological changes are associated with GCM structure in both catchments exceed uncertainty in emission scenarios. Critically, estimated uncertainty in projections of mean annual flows is less than that calculated for extreme (Q05, Q95) flows. The common approach of reporting of climate change impacts on river in terms of mean annual flows masks the magnitude of uncertainty in flows that are of most importance to water management.",1
The subject of global warming due to the increased use of fossil fuels is analyzed using a modification of the predator prey equations.

"In this paper, we present a new specification of warming cost and incorporate it into an integrated assessment model of global climate change. In the new specification, warming cost is represented as the product of possible large warming related welfare losses which occur with small probabilities that depend on the amount of temperature rise. This is in contrast to the conventional representation of warming cost as a deterministic function of temperature rise. To avoid 'curse of dimensionality' problems, we assume that losses affect the utility of consumption without directly affecting consumption itself, and that the probability of losses occurring is independent of the number of losses that may have previously occurred. The results we obtain using this new approach depend importantly on the specification of the loss probability function. Nevertheless, our results are qualitatively similar to previous results obtained using a deterministic specification of warming cost, in which cost is a cubic function of temperature rise.",1
"Liquid biofuels provide one of the few options for fossil fuel substitution in the short to medium-term and they are strongly being promoted by the European Union as transport fuel (such as ethanol) since they have the potential to offer both greenhouse gas (GHG) savings and energy security. A ""well to wheel"" analysis has been conducted for poplar based ethanol by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The aim of the analysis is to assess the environmental performance of three ethanol applications (E10, E85 and E100) in comparison with conventional gasoline. To compare the environmental profiles, the study addressed the impact potentials per kilometre driven by a middle size passenger car, taking into account the performance difference between ethanol blends and gasoline. According to the results of this study, fuel ethanol derived from poplar biomass may help to reduce the contributions to global warming, abiotic resources depletion and ozone layer depletion up to 62%, 72% and 36% respectively. Reductions of fossil fuel extraction of up to 80% could be achieved when pure ethanol is used. On the contrary, contributions to other impact categories would be increased, specifically to acidification and eutrophication. In both categories, ethanol based blends are less environmentally friendly than conventional gasoline due to the higher impact from the upstream activities. Research focussed on the reduction of the environmental impacts should be pointed forward poplar cultivation as well as ethanol conversion plant (enzyme manufacturing, energy production and distillation). In this study poplar cultivation was really intensive in order to obtain a high yield. Strategic planning according to the location of the crops and its requirements should help to reduce these impacts from its cultivation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Global warming is thought to result from emissions largely caused by combustion reactions. Designs of burners and specifications of their materials are therefore of primary importance in restraining the warming phenomena. This paper proposes a new type of ceramic burner which incorporates many of the innovations which are needed to improve burner performance, including catalytic combustion, premixed fuel/air, recuperation of combustion heat, recycling of reaction products, electric-ignition and electron extraction. The key problems of fuel variation and thermal shock resistance of the ceramic are addressed through the concept of 'reaction gradient' in which the rich sequence of oxidation reactions during combustion is spread through three extended catalytic regimes along the isothermal ceramic device. It is evident that ceramic burners are necessary to provide catalytic activity and to promote electron transfer. The conclusion is that ceramic will ultimately replace metal in burners requiring low emissions and high exergy output. (C) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",1
"The carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio is the main factor determining the forage quality of a plant, with a low C:N ratio indicating relatively good plant digestibility and a high C:N ratio inferring relatively poor forage quality. Global atmospheric composition and climate change effects on plant carbon to nitrogen ratios are thus likely to be important when predicting possible second-order impacts of the enhanced greenhouse effect on rangeland forage quality and the resultant feeding habits of foraging animals and herbivorous insects. Equations relating the assimilation of total carbon and nitrogen rates to monthly air temperature, the ambient CO2 level and soil fertility were used together with detailed spatial climatic and soil databases to simulate regional patterns of C:N ratios over southern Africa. Carbon to nitrogen ratios were estimated for both the present climate and for a possible future climate scenario defined by a general 2 degrees C mean daily temperature increase over southern Africa (but with latitudinal, seasonal and diurnal adjustments made), an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration from 360 to 560 ppmv, but with no changes in precipitation patterns. When C:N differences between future and present climates are examined, results indicate both relative increases and decreases over southern Africa in a regional context, ranging from - 8 to + 8%. Areas where the C:N ratios decreased indicate that for the future climate scenario which was assumed the relative increase in assimilated nitrogen would be greater than that for carbon. Similarly, areas where the C:N ratios increased indicate that the relative increase in assimilated carbon would be greater than that for nitrogen. In this study, regions sensitive to climate change effects on C:N ratios in southern Africa have therefore been identified and with that, those areas where the consumption of plant matter may be expected to increase or decrease as a result of anticipated global climate change.",1
"In this feature, which originally appeared in the Transportation Research Board's 88th Annual Meeting Compendium of Papers, a travel demand forecasting model simulated buildout conditions with operational deficiencies in critcal areas. Changes to roadway lane configurations were then made to achieve LOS thresholds of E through A. Many local jurisdictions seek to preserve adequate infrastructure by enacting level of service (LOS) policies for proposed new development. Understanding the relationship between roadway LOS policies and greenhouse gas emissions is an important step toward reducing the emissions related to global climate change. By influencing the evolution of urban infrastructure, these LOS standards can have a significant impact on the type and character of vehicle trips made and the subsequent emissions released. Currently, most jurisdictions establish LOS threshold policies based solely on operational standards and rarely consider the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Using a travel demand forecasting model for Grover Beach, CA, buildout conditions were simulated to make the network have operational deficiencies in critical areas, ultimately operating at a LOS F. Changes to roadway lane configurations were then made to achieve LOS thresholds of LOS E through LOS A. The resulting speed and flow data were analyzed in emission models to determine the relationship between the target LOS thresholds and emissions produced. The network was modeled for both roadway link LOS and intersection LOS conditions. For roadway links, overall, the lowest amounts of emissions were released at the LOS B threshold and the greatest incremental decrease in emissions occurred between LOS D and C. At intersections, the lowest emissions point was LOS A and the largest incremental decrease occurred between LOS D and C. When considering the feasibility of implementation of LOS thresholds, LOS C was determined to be the most effective operating point for emissions.",1
"This study has been carried out to forecast the impact of global warming on the precipitation pattern of Saudi Arabia by the end of year 2100. Simulation has been done using EdGCM model software (with available 8x10 resolution) developed at Columbia University on which there have been produced global precipitation maps for the seasonal and annual averages for the last 5 years (2096-2100). For each map, EdGCM grid values surrounding Saudi Arabia are used as input to one of the tools of Eagle point software called surface modelling (SM). SM is a new approach for downscaling global climate model results. SM software modelled out isohyets at 0.2mm/day interval. The results indicate that the present pattern of precipitation (more in winter and less in summer) is going to change by almost equal occurrence of precipitation in all seasons for double_CO2 (2CO2) experiment. The 2CO2 experiment indicates an increase of about 16.05% over the annual average precipitation across the country.",1
"Policies that attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions, allocate emissions rights, or distribute compensation to those most damaged by climate change must explicitly incorporate the international heterogeneity of the climate change threat. To capture the distinct susceptibilities associated with lack of infrastructure, potential property loss, and gross human exposure, we develop an integration of climate change projections and poverty, wealth, and population metrics. Our analysis shows that most nations of the world are threatened by the interaction of regional climatic changes with one or more relevant socioeconomic factors. Nations that have the highest levels of poverty, wealth, and population face greater relative exposure in those dimensions. However, for each of those socioeconomic indicators, spatial heterogeneity in projected climate change determines the overall international pattern of socioclimatic exposure. Our synthesis provides a critical missing piece to the climate change debate and should facilitate the formulation of climate policies that account for international variations in the threat of climate change across a range of socioeconomic dimensions.",1
"Changes in global climate may exacerbate other anthropogenic stressors, accelerating the decline in distribution and abundance of rare species throughout the world. We examined the potential effects of a warming climate on the greenback cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias), a resident salmonid that inhabits headwater streams of the central Rocky Mountains. Greenbacks are outcompeted at lower elevations by normative species of trout and currently are restricted to upper-elevation habitats where barriers to upstream migration by nonnatives are or have been established. We used likelihood-based techniques and information theoretics to select models predicting stream temperature changes for 10 streams where greenback cutthroat trout have been translocated. These models showed high variability among responses by different streams, indicating the usefulness of a stream-specific approach. We used these models to project changes in stream temperatures based on 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C warming of average air temperatures. In these warming scenarios, spawning is predicted to begin from 2 to 3.3 weeks earlier than would be expected under baseline conditions. Of the 10 streams used in this assessment, 5 currently have less than a 50% chance of translocation success. Warming increased the probability of translocation success in these 5 streams by 12% and 28% in the 2 scenarios, respectively. Assuming barriers to upstream migration by normative competitors maintain their integrity, we conclude that an overall habitat improvement results because greenbacks have been restricted through competition with nonnatives to suboptimal habitats, which are generally too cold to be highly productive.",1
"The Arctic contains extensive soil carbon reserves that could provide a substantial positive feedback to atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming. Evaluation of this hypothesis requires a mechanistic understanding of the in situ responses of individual components of tundra net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) to warming. In this study, we measured NEE, total ecosystem respiration and respiration from below ground in experimentally warmed plots within Alaskan acidic tussock tundra. Soil warming of 2-4 degreesC during a single growing season caused strong increases in total ecosystem respiration and belowground respiration from moss-dominated inter-tussock areas, and similar trends from sedge-dominated tussocks. Consequently, the overall effect of the manipulation was to substantially enhance net ecosystem carbon loss during mid-summer. Components of vascular plant biomass were closely correlated with total ecosystem respiration and belowground respiration in control plots of both microsites, but not in warmed plots. By contrast, in the warmed inter-tussock areas, below ground respiration was most closely correlated with organic-layer depth. Warming in tussock areas was associated with increased leaf nutrient pools, indicating enhanced rates of soil nutrient mineralisation. Together, these results suggest that warming enhanced net ecosystem CO2 efflux primarily by stimulating decomposition of soil organic matter, rather than by increasing plant-associated respiration. Our short-term experiment provides field evidence to support previous growth chamber and modelling studies indicating that arctic soil C reserves are relatively sensitive to warming and could supply an initial positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations/changing climate.",1
" Freshwater ecosystems will be profoundly affected by global climate change, especially those in mountainous areas, which are known to be particularly vulnerable to warming temperatures. We modelled impacts of climate change on the distribution ranges of 38 species of benthic stream macroinvertebrates from nine macroinvertebrate orders covering all river zones from the headwaters to large river reaches. 2. Species altitudinal shifts as well as range changes up to the year 2080 were simulated using the A2a and B2a Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate-warming scenarios. Presence-only species distribution models were constructed for a stream network in Germany's lower mountain ranges by means of consensus projections of four algorithms, as implemented in the BIOMOD package in R (GLM, GAM, GBM and ANN). 3. Species were predicted to shift an average of 122 and 83 m up in altitude along the river continuum by the year 2080 under the A2a and B2a climate-warming scenarios, respectively. No correlation between altitudinal shifts and mean annual air temperature of species' occurrence could be detected. 4. Depending on the climate-warming scenario, most or all (97% for A2a and 100% for B2a) of the macroinvertebrate species investigated were predicted to survive under climate change in the study area. Ranges were predicted to contract for species that currently occur in streams with low annual mean air temperatures but expand for species that inhabit rivers where air temperatures are higher. 5. Our models predict that novel climate conditions will reorganise species composition and community structure along the river continuum. Possible effects are discussed, including significant reductions in population size of headwater species, eventually leading to a loss of genetic diversity. A shift in river species composition is likely to enhance the establishment of non-native macroinvertebrates in the lower reaches of the river continuum.",1
"Environmental concerns. as well as the expected depletion of fossil fuel resources, have become the driving forces for research and development towards the introduction Of hydrogen energy into air traffic. The present paper is a summary of a study that was carried out within the European sponsored project CRYOPLANE. co-ordinated by Airbus Germany. The objectives of this study are to re-optimise and compare two equivalent medium-range aircraft - one kerosene-fuelled and one LH2-fuelled - for reduced cruise altitude. from an environmental point of view. By lowering the cruise altitude, the contribution to global warming might be reduced at the expense of increased fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. In order to assess the global impact, in terms of global warming, from the emissions discharged oil a certain mission, a simple parametric model is employed. The results suggest that introduction of cryoplanes will improve the environmental performance, particularly in terms of global warming Provided that an increase in fuel consumption in the order of 10% and all increase in TOM of a few percent are accepted, the results suggest that cryoplanes should cruise at an altitude of about 2-3 km below where conventional aircraft cruise today in order to considerably reduce the environmental impact.

"We have used the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique General Circulation Model (LMD GCM) to estimate the contribution of different regions to global black carbon ( BC) atmospheric burden and direct radiative forcing (DRF). On the global scale, fossil fuels and biofuels account for 66% and 34% of energy-related BC emissions, respectively. East and South Asia together contribute more than 50% of the global surface, atmospheric, and top-of-atmosphere DRF by BC. The regional contributions to global mean forcings closely follow the respective contributions to atmospheric burden. The global warming potential (GWP) of BC for different regions ranges from 374 to 677 with a global mean of 480. Europe is the largest contributor (63%) to BC deposition at high latitudes. The indirect GWP due to the BC effect on snow albedo is estimated to be largest for Europe ( possibly as large as 1200), suggesting that BC emission reductions from this region are more efficient to mitigate climate change.",1
"Recycling is widely assumed to be environmentally beneficial, although the collection, sorting and processing of materials into new products also entails significant environmental impacts. This study compares the relative environmental impacts of a recycling system (incorporating the kerbside collection of recyclable materials and their subsequent use by manufacturers), with a waste disposal system (in which the waste is disposed to landfill and primary raw materials are used in manufacture), using the technique of lifecycle assessment. The methodology is then extended to incorporate an economic evaluation of the environmental impacts. This combination of lifecycle assessment and economic evaluation can be termed 'Lifecycle Evaluation'. Lifecycle assessment quantifies and evaluates the environmental impacts of a product from the acquisition of raw materials, through manufacture and use, to final disposal. Lifecycle assessment can also provide a framework for the analysis of environmental impacts from systems such as transport, or waste management, as demonstrated in this paper. The results, for a case study of Milton Keynes in Central England, show that the recycling system generally performs better than the waste disposal system in terms of contribution to global warming, acidification effects and nutrification of surface water. An alternative method of analysis is then used, in which an economic valuation of the environmental impacts is carried out. This produces net benefits for recycling, per tonne of material, of pound 1769 for aluminium, pound 238 for steel, pound 226 for paper and pound 188 for glass, and net costs of pound 2.57 for high density polyethylene (HDPE), pound 4.10 for poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) and pound 7.28 for poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET). It is concluded that lifecycle evaluation, the combination of lifecycle assessment and economic valuation, can be applied to a variety of waste management issues such as the appraisal of alternative methods of collection for recycling or an examination of the UK waste management hierarchy. This technique allows impacts to be expressed in homogenous units, and the inclusion of social and environmental impacts that would not normally be addressed within a lifecycle assessment. The approach would also facilitate the evaluation of environmental and social effects at a local level, which are particularly crucial to the success of community recycling schemes. Lifecycle evaluation could provide a powerful tool to aid the development of sustainable waste management and recycling policy.",1
"Peatlands cover around 13 Mha in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia. Human activities have rapidly increased in the peatland ecosystems during the last two decades, invariably degrading them and making them vulnerable to fires. This causes high carbon emissions that contribute to global climate change. For this article, we used 94 high resolution (10-20 m) satellite images to map the status of peatland degradation and development in Sumatra and Kalimantan using visual image interpretation. The results reveal that less than 4% of the peatland areas remain covered by pristine peatswamp forests (PSFs), while 37% are covered by PSFs with varying degree of degradation. Furthermore, over 20% is considered to be unmanaged degraded landscape, occupied by ferns, shrubs and secondary growth. This alarming extent of degradation makes peatlands vulnerable to accelerated peat decomposition and catastrophic fire episodes that will have global consequences. With on-going degradation and development the existence of the entire tropical peatland ecosystem in this region is in great danger.",1
"Global warming attributed in part to the release of the so-called greenhouse gases is becoming an increasing concern, and steps are being implemented to mitigate such emissions. The two most significant emissions are carbon dioxide and methane. A significant fraction of emissions is emitted by oil and gas production and transportation facilities. Because methane has at least 21 times the greenhouse gas potential of carbon dioxide, it is advantageous to convert methane to carbon dioxide via combustion, even if the carbon dioxide is vented to the atmosphere. Fugitive methane combustion does however present certain difficulties in its combustion. This paper presents an overview of the problem and suggests some possible catalytic reactor technologies appropriate for the solution. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Surface air temperature (SAT) over the globe, particularly the Northern Hemisphere continents, has rapidly risen over the last 2-3 decades, leading to an abrupt shift toward a warmer climate state after 1997/98. Whether the terrestrial warming might be caused by local response to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations or by sea surface temperature (SST) rise is recently in dispute. The SST warming itself may be driven by both the increasing GHG forcing and slowly varying natural processes. Besides, whether the recent global warming might affect seasonal-to-interannual climate predictability is an important issue to be explored. Based on the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) climate prediction system in which only observed SSTs are assimilated for coupled model initialization, the present study shows that the historical SST rise plays a key role in driving the intensified terrestrial warming over the globe. The SST warming trend, while negligible for short lead predictions, has substantial impact on the climate predictability at long lead times (>1 yr) particularly in the extratropics. The tropical climate predictability, however, is little influenced by global warming. Given a perfect warming trend and/or a perfect model, global SAT and precipitation could be predicted beyond two years in advance with an anomaly correlation skill above similar to 0.6. Without assimilating ocean subsurface observations, model initial conditions show a strong spurious cooling drift of subsurface temperature; this is caused by large negative surface heat flux damping arising from the SST-nudging initialization. The spurious subsurface cooling drift acts to weaken the initial SST warming trend during model forecasts, leading to even negative trends of global SAT and precipitation at long lead times and hence deteriorating the global climate predictability. Concerning the important influence of the subsurface temperature on the global SAT trend, future efforts are required to develop a good scheme for assimilating subsurface information particularly in the extratropical oceans.",1
"Near-shore waters along the northwest African margin are characterized by coastal upwelling and represent one of the world's major upwelling regions. Sea surface temperature (SST) records from Moroccan sediment cores, extending back 2500 years, reveal anomalous and unprecedented cooling during the 20th century, which is consistent with increased upwelling. Upwelling-driven SSTs also vary out of phase with millennial-scale changes in Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies (NHTAs) and show relatively warm conditions during the Little Ice Age and relatively cool conditions during the Medieval Warm Period. Together, these results suggest that coastal upwelling varies with NHTAs and that upwelling off northwest Africa may continue to intensify as global warming and atmospheric CO(2) levels increase.",1
"Ventilation is ambiguously related to the energy saving rationale originating from the mitigation of global warming, the reaching of peak oil or health concerns related to fossil fuel burning. Since it makes up for about half of the energy consumption in well-insulated buildings, it is an attractive target for energy saving measures. However, simply reducing ventilation rates has unwanted repercussions on the indoor air quality. Two main strategies have been developed to reconcile these seemingly opposing interests: heat recovery and demand control ventilation. This paper focuses on the energy saving potential of demand controlled mechanical exhaust ventilation in residences and on the influence such systems may have on the indoor air quality to which the occupants of the dwellings are exposed. The conclusions are based on simulations done with a multi-zone airflow model of a detached house that is statistically representative for the average Belgian dwelling. Four approaches to demand based control are tested and reported. Within the paper exposure to carbon dioxide and to a tracer gas are used as indicators for indoor air quality. Both energy demand and exposures are reported and compared to the results for a standard, building code compliant, exhaust system, operating at continuous flow rates. The sensitivity of the control strategies to environmental and user variations is tested using Monte-Carlo techniques. Under the conditions that were applied, reductions on the ventilation heat loss of 25-60% are found, depending on the chosen control strategy (with the exclusion of adventitious ventilation and infiltration).

"Global warming projection experiments were conducted using a 20-km mesh global atmospheric model, focusing on the change in the rain band of East Asian summer monsoon. To assess the uncertainty of climate change projections, we performed ensemble simulations with the 60-km resolution model combining four different SSTs and three atmospheric initial conditions. In the present-day climate simulations, the 20-km model reproduces the rain band of East Asian summer monsoon better than lower resolution models in terms of geographical distribution and seasonal march. In the future climate simulation by the 20-km model, precipitation increases over the Yangtze River valley in May through July, Korean peninsula in May, and Japan in July. The termination of rainy season over Japan tends to be delayed until August. Ensemble simulations by the 60-km model show that precipitation in the future climate for July increases over the Yangtze River valley, the East China Sea and Japan. These changes in precipitation are partly consistent with those projected by the 20-km model. Simulations by the 20-km and 60-km models consistently show that in the future climate the termination of rainy season over Japan tends to be delayed until August. The changes in the vertically integrated water vapor flux show the intensification of clockwise moisture transport over the western Pacific subtropical high. Most precipitation changes over the East Asia can be interpreted as the moisture convergence resulting from change in the horizontal transport of water vapor.",1
"The aim of this paper is to describe the energetic metabolism of a retail park service system tinder an integrative approach. Energy flow accounting was applied to a case study retail park in Spain, representative of the sector across Europe, after redefining the functional unit to account for both direct energy use (buildings, gardens and outdoor lighting) and indirect energy use (employee and customer transportation). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was then undertaken to determine energy global warming potential (GWP) and some energy intensity and greenhouse gases (GHG) emission indicators were defined and applied. The results emphasise the importance of service systems in global warming policies, as a potential emission of 9.26 kg CO(2)/purchase was obtained for the case study, relating to a consumption of 64 KOE of energy, of which 29% was spent oil buildings and 57.9% on customer transportation. Some strategies to reduce these emissions were considered: increased supply, energy efficiency, changes in distribution of modes of transport, changes in location and changes in the mix of land uses. A combination of all of these elements in a new retail park could reduce GHG emissions by more than 50%, as it is planning strategies, which seem to be the most effective. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"The carbon balance of tropical peatlands was investigated using measurements of gaseous fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) at several land-use types, including nondrained forest (NDF), drained forest (DF), drained regenerating forest (DRF) after clear cutting and agricultural land (AL) in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Soil greenhouse gas fluxes depended on land-use, water level (WL), microtopography, temperature and vegetation physiology, among which WL was the strongest driver. All sites were CH(4) sources on an annual basis and the emissions were higher in sites providing fresh litter deposition and water logged conditions. Soil CO(2) flux increased exponentially with soil temperature (T(s)) even within an amplitude of 4-5 degrees C. In the NDF soil CO(2) flux sharply decreased when WLs rose above -0.2 and 0.1 m for hollows and hummocks, respectively. The sharp decrease suggests that the contribution of surface soil respiration (RS) to total soil CO(2) flux is large. In the DF soil CO(2) flux increased as WL decreased below -0.7 m probably because the fast aerobic decomposition continued in lower peat. Such an increase in CO(2) flux at low WLs was also found at the stand level of the DF. Soil CO(2) flux showed diurnal variation with a peak in the daytime, which would be caused by the circadian rhythm of root respiration. Among the land-use types, annual soil CO(2) flux was the largest in the DRF and the smallest in the AL. Overall, the global warming potential (GWP) of CO(2) emissions in these land-use types was much larger than that of CH(4) fluxes.",1
"The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme is an international collaboration supported by 16 countries and several industrial organisations. Its purpose is to evaluate technologies for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. In the first 3 years of work, the programme concentrated on CO2 emissions from power stations. The main types of power plant and various technologies for capturing CO2 were examined. Storage and utilisation options for CO2 were assessed. The work culminated in the life cycle assessment reported here of 3 fossil fuel based power generation cycles in which CO2 was captured and stored. For each fuel cycle, one natural gas and two coal based, a full 'cradle-to-grave' analysis of emissions was made. A fundamental objective was to establish a consistent and transparent methodology which could form the basis for comparing technical responses to the possibility of global warming. The paper discusses the logic behind the assumptions, and limitations in the data and methodolgy. The uncertainty of much of the data on environmental externalities is recognised and a distinction made between lack of scientific data and the influence of value judgements. External costs that were quantified are small relative to the private costs.",1
"Climate changes are one of the major challenges in our century. Climate changes affect its all both at a global and at a national level. Although scientific analyses show that climate changes cover a very long period of time (up to millions of years), yet, the history of the last decades shows that some climate changes are faster and faster because of objective, intrinsic processes of the planet as well as due to the human activity. In the last years, one could see an increase of extreme climate phenomena, such as drought, floods, tornados - even in Romania - as well as growing erosion of the Black Sea coast. Romania answered promptly to the measures taken at global and European level as far as climate changes are concerned Romania adopted the main documents of the EU, set up institutions whose role was to support the fight, wrote and sent reports about the gas emissions at national level. Unfortunately, judicial actions were not supported by the society and did not receive funding.",1
"This paper aims to contribute new insights globally and regionally on how carbon forest mitigation contributes to sustainable development in South America. Carbon finance has emerged as a potential policy option to tackling global climate change, degradation of forests, and social development in poor countries. This paper focuses on evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of a set of forest based mitigation pilot projects that emerged under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The paper reviews research conducted in 2001-2002, drawing from empirical data from four pilot projects, derived from qualitative stakeholder interviews, and complemented by policy documents and literature. Of the four projects studied three are located in frontier areas, where there are considerable pressures for conversion of standing forest to agriculture. in this sense, forest mitigation projects have a substantial role to play in the region. Findings suggest however, that all four projects have experienced cumbersome implementation processes specifically, due to weak social objectives, poor communication, as well as time constraints. In three out of four cases, stakeholders highlighted limited local acceptance at the implementation stages. In the light of these findings, we discuss opportunities for implementation of future forest based mitigation projects in the land use sector. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",1
"Methane is primarily a biogenic gas, which is implicated in global climate change. Among all the sources of methane emission, paddy fields form the most dominant source. An experiment was conducted with a common paddy crop (Oryza sativa var. Vishnuparag) by amending the soils with different organic manures and biofertilizers with a view to find out an inexpensive strategy to mitigate methane emission from the rice-fields. The results revealed that there was a seasonal change in the CH(4) flux, registering a peak at heading stage in all treatments. The application of rice straw before flooding and the biofertilizer after flooding enhances CH(4) efflux from the rice-fields significantly, while composts of cowdung and leaves did not stimulate CH(4) production and, rather, decreased CH(4) fluxes. As soil pH and temperature were optimum for methanogenesis, it was likely that the organic C and the redox potential mainly modulated methane production and its emission through rice plants.",1
"A growing body of geologic evidence suggests that emplacement of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) played a major role in global warming during the early Paleogene as well as in the transient Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) event. A similar to 5 million year record of major and trace element abundances spanning 56 to 51 Ma at Deep Sea Drilling Project Sites 401 and 549 confirms that the majority of NAIP volcanism occurred as subaerial flows. Thus the trace element records provide constraints on the nature and scope of the environmental impact of the NAIP during the late Paleocene-early Eocene interval. Subaerial volcanism would have injected mantle CO2 directly into the atmosphere, resulting in a more immediate increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas abundances than CO2 input through submarine volcanism. The lack of significant hydrothermalism contradicts recently proposed mechanisms for thermally destabilizing methane hydrate reservoirs during the PETM. Any connection between NAIP volcanism and PETM warming had to occur through the atmosphere. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Global warming caused by anthropogenic CO(2) emissions is expected to reduce the capability of the ocean and the land biosphere to take up carbon. This will enlarge the fraction of the CO(2) emissions remaining in the atmosphere, which in turn will reinforce future climate change. Recent model studies agree in the existence of such a positive climate-carbon cycle feedback, but the estimates of its amplitude differ by an order of magnitude, which considerably increases the uncertainty in future climate projections. Therefore we discuss, in how far a particular process or component of the carbon cycle can be identified, that potentially contributes most to the positive feedback. The discussion is based on simulations with a carbon cycle model, which is embedded in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation model ECHAM5/MPI-OM. Two simulations covering the period 1860-2100 are conducted to determine the impact of global warming on the carbon cycle. Forced by historical and future carbon dioxide emissions (following the scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), they reveal a noticeable positive climate-carbon cycle feedback, which is mainly driven by the tropical land biosphere. The oceans contribute much less to the positive feedback and the temperate/boreal terrestrial biosphere induces a minor negative feedback. The contrasting behavior of the tropical and temperate/boreal land biosphere is mostly attributed to opposite trends in their net primary productivity (NPP) under global warming conditions. As these findings depend on the model employed they are compared with results derived from other climate-carbon cycle models, which participated in the Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP).",1
"This study presents results from the Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM3) forced with early to middle Miocene (similar to 20-14 Ma) vegetation, topography, bathymetry, and modern CO2. A decrease in the meridional temperature gradient of 6.5 degrees C and an increase in global mean temperature of 5 degrees C are modeled in comparison with a control simulation forced with modern boundary conditions. Seasonal poleward displacements of the subtropical jet streams and storm tracks compared to the control simulation are associated with changes in Hadley circulation and significant cooling of the polar stratosphere, consistent with previously predicted effects of global warming. Energy budget calculations indicate that reduced albedo and topography were responsible for Miocene warmth in the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere while a combination of increased ocean heat transport and reduced albedo was responsible for relative warmth in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere, compared to the present. Model-data analysis suggests Miocene climate was significantly warmer and wetter than simulated here, consistent with previous uncoupled Miocene models and supports recent reconstructions of Miocene CO2 substantially higher than present.",1

"For the Tortonian, Steppuhn et al. [Steppuhn, A., Micheels, A., Geiger, G., Mosbrugger, V., 2006.

Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 238, 399-423] perform a model simulation which considers a generally lower palaeorography, a weaker ocean heat transport and an atmospheric COZ concentration of 353 ppm. The Tortonian simulation of Steppuhn et al. [Steppuhn, A., Micheels, A., Geiger, G., Mosbrugger, V, 2006. Reconstructing the Late Miocene climate and oceanic heat flux using the AGCM ECHAM4 coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model with adjusted flux correction. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 238, 399-423] demonstrates some realistic trends: the high latitudes are warmer than today and the meridional temperature gradient is reduced. However, the Tortonian run also indicates some insufficiencies such as too cool mid-latitudes which can be due to an underestimated pCO(2) in the atmosphere. As a sensitivity study, we perform a further model experiment for which we additionally increase the atmospheric carbon dioxide (700 ppm). According to this CO2 sensitivity experiment, we find a global warming and a globally more intense water cycle as compared to the previous Tortonian run. Particularly the high latitudes are warmer in the Tortonian CO2 sensitivity run which leads to a lower amount of Arctic sea ice and a reduced equator-to-pole temperature difference. Our Tortonian CO2 sensitivity study basically agrees with results from recent climate model experiments which consider an increase of CO2 during the next century (e.g. [Cubasch, U., Meehl, G.A., Boer, G.J., Stouffer, R.J., Dix, M., Noda, A., Senior, C.A., Raper, S., Yap, K.S., 200 Projections of Future Climate Change.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 525-582]) suggesting that the climatic response on a higher atmospheric CO2 concentration is almost independent from the different settings of boundary conditions (Tortonian versus today). To validate the Tortonian model simulations, we perform a quantitative comparison with terrestrial proxy data. This comparison demonstrates that the Tortonian CO2 sensitivity experiment tends to be more realistic than the previous Tortonian simulation by Steppuhn et al.

However, a high carbon dioxide concentration of 700 ppm is questionable for the Late Miocene, and it cannot explain shortcomings of our Tortonian run with 'normal' CO2. In order to fully understand the Late Miocene climate, further model experiments should also consider the palaeovegetation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.",1
"The ""equivalent CO2"" approximation often used to simulate the climatic effects of a suite of trace greenhouse gases is investigated using a recent version of the NCAR Community Climate Model. We performed present-day and preindustrial equilibrium climate simulations. The climate sensitivity is lower by similar to 20% in the equivalent CO2 case compared to the control case in which the individual trace gases were treated explicitly. This is reflected in similar percentage differences in global- and annual-mean surface temperature, precipitation, precipitable water, and sea ice. The temperature changes are also different regionally in the tropical and subtropical troposphere and in the stratosphere. This difference in climate sensitivity originates from differences in the spatial pattern of radiative forcing. The equivalent CO2 forcing pattern differs from the control case forcing pattern for several reasons, but the dependence on temperature of the Planck emission spectrum appears to be fundamentally most important. The primary absorption bands of CH4 and N2O are found at wavelengths more sensitive to the temperature-related shift of the wavelength of maximum emission than the absorption bands of CO2. This leads to stronger spatial variations in absorption by trace gases than by CO2. We conclude that because of differences in the pattern of radiative forcing, the equilibrium response of global climate to increases in trace gases is larger than the response to an ""equivalent"" increase in CO2, and the patterns of response are also different.",1
"The post- glacial history of the Great Lakes has involved several changes in lake levels throughout the latest Pleistocene and Holocene, resulting from the changing position of the retreating Laurentide ice sheet, outlet incision and isostatic rebound. The final lowering of lake levels occurred at approximately 7600 C-14 yr BP, after which lake levels began to rise again to the Nipissing highstand at approximately 4700 C-14 yr BP. During this time of rising lake levels, black bands of iron sulfide were being formed in the sediments of all five of the Great Lakes. These bands signify suboxic to anoxic conditions, at least within the sediments and possibly at the sediment- water interface, during the middle Holocene warm interval. During this interval, the climate was warmer and drier than present, possibly resulting in the occasional absence of seasonal turnover in the lakes. We examined a series of piston cores from northern Lakes Michigan and Huron and found that the black bands are correlatable among cores taken from within the same basin. The observation that the banding can be correlated suggests a basin- wide cause, near- bottom or sub- bottom anoxia in the northern Michigan and northern Huron sediments during the mid- Holocene warm period. The sedimentary and geochemical processes in the Great Lakes during the middle Holocene warm interval are good indicators of possible future scenarios for the lakes as a result of global warming, as 21(st) - century temperatures are predicted to reach similar levels due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.",1
"Livestock production is a possible approach to alleviate poverty especially for the rural poor. However, while the sector gains intensity, problems attendant to it such as soil and water pollution, animal health and diseases, nutrient loading and contribution to global warming also increased. Failure to address these problems will create greater harm on people's health and the environment. This study commissioned by FAO, aims to provide an objective assessment of environmental animal health and production in Laguna, Philippines, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, as a baseline for future temporal and spatial comparisons. Using Geo-Information System as a tool with secondary data collection and survey as means to collect the input data, overlay maps were created. The use of animal unit density of livestock and poultry farms was also developed to determine the hotspot areas in terms of production, health and diseases, nutrient loading and contribution to global warming. As a result, the study was able to (1) map distribution, quantities, and densities, (2) identify trends and patterns, and (3) delineate hotspots, which aided significantly in studying livestock and environment interaction in Laguna Province.",1
"The result in climate simulations, supported in the observation-based record, is that the ratio phi - T-L/T(O)of land-average to ocean-average temperature change is greater than one and varies comparatively modestly as climate changes. This is investigated in results from the CMIP3 data archive of climate change simulations following the B1 and more strongly forced A1B scenarios as well as in 2xCO(2) integrations. The associated precipitation ratio psi = P-L/P-O is also considered briefly. The behaviour of I center dot is analyzed in terms of a forcing-response view of the energy balance over land and ocean regions. The analysis indicates that the value of I center dot > 1 is not maintained by separate local balances over land and ocean but by an energetic balance that also involves a change in transport between the regions. The transport change does not restrain the land warming by exporting energy to the ocean region but, rather, the reverse. The anomalous transport is from the ocean to the land region even though the ocean warms less than the land does. Feedbacks in the ocean region, especially in the equatorial Pacific, do not sufficiently counteract the forcing and the result is an excess of energy that is transported to the land. The land warms in order to radiate away both the energy from the forcing over land but also the extra energy imported from the ocean region, thereby maintaining I center dot >  This situation can be understood to parallel the SST-forced case in model studies where I center dot > 1 despite the forcing being confined to the ocean area. The climate system is effective in redistributing forcing so that it is the local feedbacks, rather than the pattern of the forcing, that determine the temperature response. Land and ocean averaged quantities and budgets behave in a consistent manner to provide a simplified representation of the changes in temperature and energetic processes that are occurring. The geographical distributions of the terms do not, however, display a strong land/ocean demarcation. The land/ocean average budgets and balances are the residual of processes that vary considerably within the land and ocean boundaries.",1
"The Life Cycle Assessment of four CO2 recovery technologies, combined with nine CO2 sequestration systems, serves to expand the debate of CO2 mitigation methods beyond a single issue-prevention of global warming-to a wider range of environmental concerns: resource depletion, acidic and toxic gases, wastes, etc, so that the overall, and unexpected, environmental impacts may be revealed.",1
"In this paper, we develop a modeling and computational framework that allows for the determination of optimal carbon taxes applied to electric power plants in the context of electric power supply chain (generation/distribution/consumption) networks. The adoption of carbon/pollution taxes both internationally and regionally has been fueled by global climate change and fuel security risks, with a significant portion of such policy interventions directed at the electric power industry. The general framework that we develop allows for three distinct types of carbon taxation environmental policies, beginning with a completely decentralized scheme in which taxes can be applied to each individual power generator/power plant in order to guarantee that each assigned emission bound is not exceeded, to two versions of a centralized scheme, one which assumes a fixed bound over the entire electric power supply chain in terms of total carbon emissions and the other which allows the bound to be a function of the tax. The behavior of the various decision-makers in the electric power supply chain network is described, along with the three taxation schemes, and the governing equilibrium conditions, which are formulated as finite-dimensional variational inequality problems. Twelve numerical examples are presented in which the optimal carbon taxes, as well as the equilibrium electric power flows and demands, are computed. The numerical results demonstrate, as the theory predicts, that the carbon taxes achieve the desired goal, in that the imposed bounds on the carbon emissions are not exceeded. Moreover, they illustrate the spectrum of scenarios that can be explored in terms of changes in the bounds on the carbon emissions; changes in emission factors; changes in the demand price functions, etc. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"The use of a large solar shield located sunward of the Sun-Earth interior Lagrange point is considered to offset increases in mean global surface temperature due to enhanced greenhouse warming. The three-body mechanics of the problem are investigated to optimize the shield location, thus minimizing the shield mass and improving on previous studies of this concept. While shield mass is minimized, the required mass is still of order 10(11) kg to offset an enhancement of greenhouse warming of order 2 K. Clearly, such schemes require significant technological capabilities, although the optimization presented in this paper reduces the scale of the problem to some extent.",1
"The current role of Amazonia in the terrestrial carbon budget is the focus of intensive scientific interest, in large part due to its potential to accelerate global warming. However, its role in mediating CO, changes over millennial time-scales since the last C Glacial maximum (LGM) has Generally been overlooked and is the subject of speculation. Recent advances in our understanding of the Late Quaternary history of Amazonian ecosystems offers an opportunity to make more informed inferences about Late Quaternary changes in the magnitude of Amazon carbon storage than has hitherto been possible. Therefore, in this paper, we reconstruct changes in the magnitude of Amazon carbon storage over the last 21,000 years (since the LGM) by reference to recently published palaeohydrological and palaeoecological data and compare these data with results from simulations using a process-based terrestrial ecosystem model for the Mid-Holocene and the LGM. Building on these results further, we interpret changes in tropical forest biomass in the context of Late Quaternary polar ice-core records of atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide concentrations. Palaeo-data and model simulations show that Amazonia was predominantly forested at the LGM, although there is evidence for savanna expansion near the margins of the Basin and southern Amazonia may have been covered by deciduous/serni-deciduous dry forests rather than evergreen rain forests. We estimate Amazon C storage at the LGM to be only 135 Gt C (50% smaller than today), but find that its proportion of the entire terrestrial carbon store was almost twice that of today. The model shows that between the LGM and the Mid-Holocene there is a significant increase in evergreen broad-leaf forests at the expense of deciduous forests and a 67% increase in total Amazon C storage, attributable to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO, levels. Although our results indicate that the Amazon Basin was dominated by rain forests throughout the Holocene, rain forest cover expanded in the Late Holocene (at the expense of savannas) and total Amazon carbon storage is simulated to have risen by 22% between the Mid-Holocene (225 Gt C) and the present day (Pre-Industrial) (225 Gt C). Comparison of these Amazon carbon fluxes with palaeo-data from other parts of the world suggests that, contrary to previous hypotheses., the terrestrial biosphere acted as a net carbon sink throughout the Holocene, and that the observed CO, rise from 260 to 285 ppmv between 8 and 1 ka BP (revealed by the Antarctic Taylor Dome ice-core record) may have been driven by release of carbon from the oceans rather than land.

"In order to minimize contributions to global warming, it is important to develop a perfluorocompound (PFC) abatement system that can remove PFCs effectively with low electric power. We have developed a new PFC abatement system consisting mainly of a 2-MHz ICP plasma source and two Ca(OH)(2)/CaO columns operated under a decompression pressure. Reactive fluorinated compounds including SiF4 are immobilized in the Ca(OH)(2)/CaO columns without a water scrubber. Stable compounds such as CF4 are excited by the 2-MHz ICP plasma. When the emissions from an Si oxidation film etching process chamber were treated by this abatement system, F-2 equivalent removal efficiency was 99.6%, which was about one order of magnitude larger than that of a conventional abatement system. But the CO2 equivalent removal efficiency was calculated to be 94% because over 95% of CO2 equivalent emissions were caused by the plasma source power consumption of 2.4 kWh. It means that minimization of the plasma source power consumption, depending on PFC emissions, is a very effective method of minimizing contributions to global warming in a manner similar to improving the PFC removal efficiency.",1
"The sustainable development against global warming is a challenge faced by societies at global level. For steel industry, the pressure of reducing CO, emission is likely to last many years. During the past decades, the CO2 emission per ton steel has been reduced mainly due to the improvement of energy efficiency. Entering the 21st century, the steel manufacturing route must have three functions, namely, production of high performance steel products, conversion of energy, and treatment of waste. In the near future, it is expected that existing BF-BOF and EAF routes will be improved, in order to produce high performance steels, increase the use of scrap, and integrate steel industry with other industries for mitigating CO2 emission. In the long term, using carbon-free energy, reducing agents, and storing CO2 securely or converting CO2 into a harmless substance can be presumed for tremendous reduction in CO2 emission.",1
"Major greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to plastic waste recycling were evaluated with respect to three management alternatives: recycling of clean, single-type plastic, recycling of mixed/contaminated plastic, and use of plastic waste as fuel in industrial processes. Source-separated plastic waste was received at a material recovery facility (MRF) and processed for granulation and subsequent downstream use. In the three alternatives, plastic was assumed to be substituting virgin plastic in new products, wood in low-strength products (outdoor furniture, fences, etc.), and coal or fuel oil in the case of energy utilization. GHG accounting was organized in terms of indirect upstream emissions (e.g. provision of energy, fuels, and materials), direct emissions at the MRF (e.g. fuel combustion), and indirect downstream emissions (e.g. avoided emissions from production of virgin plastic, wood, or coal/oil). Combined, upstream and direct emissions were estimated to be roughly between 5 and 600 kg CO2-eq.tonne(-1) of plastic waste depending on treatment at the MRF and CO2 emissions from electricity production. Potential downstream savings arising from substitution of virgin plastic, wood, and energy fuels were estimated to be around 60 1600 kg CO2-eq.tonne(-1) of plastic waste depending on substitution ratios and CO2 emissions from electricity production. Based on the reviewed data, it was concluded that substitution of virgin plastic should be preferred. If this is not viable due to a mixture of different plastic types and/or contamination, the plastic should be used for energy utilization. Recycling of plastic waste for substitution of other materials such as wood provided no savings with respect to global warming.",1
"Ensemble numerical experiments with the climate model of intermediate complexity developed at the A.M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS CM) are conducted to estimate the efficiency of controlled climate forcing (geoengineering) due to stratospheric sulfate aerosol (SSA) emissions in order to compensate for global warming under the SRES A1B anthropogenic emission scenario. Full (or even excessive) compensation for the expected anthropogenic warming in the model is possible with sufficiently intense geoengineering. For ensemble members with values of the governing parameters corresponding to those obtained for the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, global warming is reduced by no more than 0.46 K in the second half of the 21st century, with a residual rise in the global surface temperature T (g) comparative to 1961-1990 of 0-2 K by 2050 and 9-2.2 K by 2100. The largest reduction in global warming (with the other parameters of the numerical experiment being equal) is found not for a meridional distribution of SSA concentration peaked at low latitudes (despite the largest (in magnitude) global compensation instantaneous radiative forcing), but for a uniform horizontal aerosol distribution and for a distribution with the SSA concentration maximum in the middle and subpolar latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The efficiency of geoengineering in terms of T (g) in the second half of the 21st century between the most efficient and the least efficient meridional distributions of stratospheric aerosols differs by as much as one-third, depending on the values of other governing parameters. For meridional distributions of SSA concentration, which produce the largest deceleration of global warming, such a deceleration is regionally most pronounced over high- and subpolarlatitude land areas and in the Arctic. In particular, this is expressed in the smallest reduction in the sea-ice extent and permafrost area under climate warming in the model. The compensation forcing also decelerates a general increase in global annual precipitation P (g) during warming. The relative deceleration in precipitation increase is most pronounced in land regions outside the tropics, where a significant deficit in precipitation is currently observed. After the theoretical completion of geoengineering in the first or second decade, its temperature effect vanishes with an abrupt acceleration of global and regional surface warming. For individual members of the ensemble experiment, the global temperature change in this period is five times as large as that in the experiment without geoengineering and ten times as large regionally (in northeastern Siberia).",1
"Inclusion of improved forest management as a way to enhance carbon sinks in the Copenhagen Accord of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (December 2009) suggests that forest restoration will play a role in global climate change mitigation under the post-Kyoto agreement. Although discussions about restoration strategies often pertain solely to severely degraded tropical forests and invoke only the enrichment planting option, different approaches to restoration are needed to counter the full range of degrees of degradation. We propose approaches for restoration of forests that range from being slightly to severely degraded. Our methods start with ceasing the causes of degradation and letting forests regenerate on their own, progress through active management of natural regeneration in degraded areas to accelerate tree regeneration and growth, and finally include the stage of degradation at which re-planting is necessary. We argue that when the appropriate techniques are employed, forest restoration is cost-effective relative to conventional planting, provides abundant social and ecological co-benefits, and results in the sequestration of substantial amounts of carbon. For forest restoration efforts to succeed, a supportive post-Kyoto agreement is needed as well as appropriate national policies, institutional arrangements, and local participation.",1
"Thermodynamic properties of two fluorinated ethers, that meet the criteria of the potential new-generation refrigerants with considerably low global warming potential (GWP) and the zero ozone depletion potential (ODP), are studied in the present paper. The recommended candidates are pentafluoroethyl methyl ether, CF3CF2OCH3 (245cbE beta gamma), and heptafluoropropyl methyl ether, CF3CF2CF2OCH3 (347sE gamma delta), proposed as alternative refrigerants to replace 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane, CClF2CClF2 (R-114) and trichlorofluoromethane, CCl3F (R-11), respectively. The present paper summarizes the current thermodynamic property studies of the above fluorinated ethers, and their thermodynamic property modeling will be presented. The formulations are developed exclusively on the basis of the PVT property data, both in the single phase and at the saturation states. Using estimated ideal gas heat capacity data, derived properties including heat capacities and speeds of sound are calculated in a wide range of temperature and pressure, and their behaviors show the typical and physically sound characteristics of pure fluid.

"This essay presents the results of a modeling study that addresses the circulation and convection of ocean currents. A possible change in the global climate due to human-induced increase of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases is one of the major environmental challenges in our time. In order to get more insight into this problem, one needs to better understand the various components of the climate system and how they interact. Due to the large heat capacity of the global ocean, the magnitude, delay, and regional distribution of a potential global warming are to a large extent determined by exchanges of heat between the upper ocean and the world's deep ocean. An important process in this regard is deep water formation due to convection. The North Atlantic and the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Sea are particularly important regions for this process. Major parts of the circulation in this area are simulated by a coupled ke-ocean model that also includes the entire Arctic Ocean.",1
"Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG) that causes global warming. Thus, land uses such as an agroforestry system have a significant role in moderating climate change since they can be sources and sinks of carbon. The aim of the study was to generate data on the carbon stocks of two agroforestry systems, specifically a Gmelina arborea-Theobroma cacao multistorey system and an alley cropping system with Gliricidia sepium hedges at the agroforestry research and demonstration area inside a forest reserve in Southern Luzon, Philippines. The multistorey system had a mean biomass of 258 Mg C ha(-1) and a carbon density of 185 Mg C ha(-1). Carbon was stored in the various pools in the following order of magnitude: soil > tree biomass (above-ground) > necromass > understorey vegetation > roots. The Gliricidia hedgerow had a biomass density of 3.8 Mg C ha(-1); total carbon density was 93 Mg C ha(-1), of which 92 Mg C ha(-1) was in the soil.",1
"The concept of Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) has been extensively used in policy consideration as a relative index for comparing the climate impact of an emitted greenhouse gas (GHG), relative to carbon dioxide with equal mass emissions. Ozone depletion due to emission of chlorinated or brominated halocarbons leads to cooling of the climate system in the opposite direction to the direct warming contribution by halocarbons as GHGs. This cooling is a key indirect effect of the halocarbons on climatic radiative forcing, which is accounted for by indirect GWPs. With respect to climate, it is critical to understand net influences considering direct warming and indirect cooling effects especially for Halons due to the greater ozone-depleting efficiency of bromine over chlorine. Until now, the indirect GWPs have been calculated using a parameterized approach based on the concept of Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) and the observed ozone depletion over the last few decades. As a step towards obtaining indirect GWPs through a more robust approach, we use atmospheric models to explicitly calculate the indirect GWPs of Halon-1211 and Halon-1301 for a 100-year time horizon. State-of-the-art global chemistry-transport models (CTMs) were used as the computational tools to derive more realistic ozone depletion changes caused by an added pulse emission of the two major Halons at the surface. The radiative forcings on climate from the ozone changes have been calculated for indirect GWPs using an atmospheric radiative transfer model (RTM). The simulated temporal variations of global average total column Halons after a pulse perturbation follow an exponential decay with an e-folding time which is consistent with the expected chemical lifetimes of the Halons. Our calculated indirect GWPs for the two Halons are much smaller than those from past studies but are within a single standard deviation of WMO (2007) values and the direct GWP values derived agree with the published values. Our model-based assessment of the Halon indirect GWPs thus confirms the significant importance of indirect effects on climate.",1
"Remarkable global climate oscillations were recorded during the timespan middle Carboniferous-Triassic, which allows definition of two cold (icehouse 1 : middle Carboniferous; icehouse 2: early Permian) and two warm episodes (greenhouse 1: late Carboniferous - earliest Permian; greenhouse 2: middle Permian - Triassic). The tectonic evolution of the central Pangean realm from Variscan to late Variscan, and finally to early Alpine offers an explanation for these climate oscillations, in terms of mountain building, extensional collapse, rifting, epeirogeny, volcanism, erosion, and exhumation. The cold periods were associated with orogenic (icehouse 1) or epeirogenic (icehouse 2) movements leading to uplift and erosion, and therefore, to CO2 output from the atmosphere. On the contrary, the warm periods were related to extension-related phenomena, such as volcanism, deep- and shallow-seated hydrothermal activity, unroofing of large-scale metamorphic core-complexes (greenhouse 1), or vast exhumation of coal and pear deposits and volcanism (greenhouse 2), all of them processes leading to massive input of CO2 into the atmosphere, hence, to global warming.",1
"Motivated by the high abatement costs of the Kyoto Protocol for Germany, this paper is estimating the economic impact of global warming on agriculture in that country. The hedonic approach is used as theoretical background. Stating that land prices are - among others - determined by climatic factors, this approach can consequently be used to value global warming. To avoid a priori restrictions stemming from functional forms, the land price function is modeled as quadratic Box-Cox function that nests a wide range of specifications. In a second step, the estimated results are used to forecast the impact of climate change. The results indicate that German farmers will be winners of climate change in the short run, with maximum gains occurring at a temperature increase of +0.6 degrees C against current levels. In the long run, there may be losses from global warming. However, the net present value from climate change is under the most probable scenarios positive.",1
"The only really sustainable form of energy is solar energy. The densely populated tropical countries can do very well from this completely sustainable energy source without any novel technologies. Most of the commercial energy used world-wide is supplied by using nonrenewable resources. Environmental damage-global warming, ozone hole, noise, chemical and radioactive waste-is due to high energy use. Environmental deterioration is a direct consequence of wealth generated and sustained by extremely cheap fossil fuel. The price of fossil fuel does not include the cost for the deterioration of the environment. We show in this paper that even a densely populated country like Bangladesh can attain a high standard of living by a proper utilization of solar energy. We suggest that poor tropical countries should mobilize their resources to develop solar technology. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The productivity of the prickly-pear cactus Opuntia ficus-indica, which is cultivated worldwide for its fruits and stem segments, was predicted based on the responses of its net CO2 uptake to soil water status, air temperature and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Each of these environmental factors was represented by an index with a maximum value of unity when that factor was not limiting net CO2 uptake over a 24-h period. The water index, the temperature index, and the PPFD index were determined for 87 sites in the contiguous United States using data from 189 weather stations and for 148 sites worldwide using data from 1464 weather stations. The product of these three indices, the environmental productivity index (EPI), was used to predict the productivity of O. ficus-indica under current climatic conditions and under those accompanying a possible increase in the atmospheric CO2 level to 650-mu-mol mol- Sites with temperatures always above -10-degrees-C and hence suitable for prickly-pear cultivation numbered 37 in the United States and 110 worldwide; such sites increased by 43 and 5%, respectively, for the global warming accompanying the elevated CO2. Productivity of O. ficus-indica was at least 15 tonnes dry weight hectare-1 year-1, comparable to that of many agronomic crops, for 20 sites with temperatures always above -10-degrees-C in the contiguous United States and for 12 such sites worldwide under current climatic conditions; such sites increased by 85 and 117%, respectively, under the elevated CO2 condition, mainly because of direct effects of the atmospheric CO2 level on net CO2 uptake. In summary, simulations based on EPI indicate that O. ficus-indica may presently be advantageously cultivated over a substantial fraction of the earth's surface, such regions increasing markedly with a future doubling in atmospheric CO2 levels.",1
"We explored the climate impacts for two land-use change scenarios, aimed at mitigating the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the integrated assessment model IMAGE 2.2, we found that the large-scale implementation in the extratropics of either carbon-sequestration or modern-biomass plantations decreases the CO2 concentration with 70-80 ppmv by the year 2100 compared to a nonmitigation baseline. In a coupled land/atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice model this moderates global warming over the 21st century by 10%. However, the carbon-sequestration option raises the absorption of solar radiation due to a lower albedo compared to the scenario involving modern-biomass plantations (for biofuels production). The albedo-induced difference in global mean temperature is as large as the mitigation by CO2 changes in the two scenarios compared to the baseline. Further, an atmospheric circulation change in the carbon-plantation scenario weakens the supply of moisture from the oceans to North Africa and central Eurasia. In our model this decreases annual mean precipitation over North Africa by up to 10% and further increases summer temperatures over Eurasia. These findings lead us to conclude that other climate impacts than just CO2 changes have to be taken into account when discussing climate-change mitigation options that involve land-use changes.",1
"An accurate prediction of variations in water consumption from a field and in the crop growth affected by the climate change due to global warming is important for the continuous agricultural activities. Components of water consumption in a farmland, i.e. transpiration from the crop surface and evaporation from the soil surface, are influenced by the structure of crop canopy. In this study, the combined effects of elevated temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on the geometry and longevity of leaves of maize were examined through an experiment with growth chambers. Three treatments, i.e. TLCL (air temperature day/night: 28/22 degrees C, CO2 concentration: 350ppm), TLCH (28/22 degrees C, 750ppm), and THCH (32/26 degrees C, 750ppm), were performed in different closed chamber respectively, and sixteen of maize (Zea mays L. cv. Pioneer G-98) planted in a pot were grown in each treatment. The cumulative thermal time from emergence of plant until the expansion of the ith leaf became larger in the order, TLCH < TLCL < THCH. The longevity of the ith leaf became longer in the order, TLCL < TLCH < THCH. Area of the ith leaf in THCH was clearly smaller than that in TLCL and TLCH.",1
"An analysis of four transportation systems (Velib, Zipcar, ERP Singapore, and Transantiago) shows the strategic value of creating a symbiotic relationship between physical and informational systems in order to increase the convenience and patronage of these systems. The four information drives (ubiquity, uniqueness, unison, and universality) are extended to a physical setting and used to report the key characteristics of each system from both a physical and informational perspective. The article argues that the traditional customer orientation to determining systems requirements may fail to create the breakthrough systems designs that are required to reduce society's climate harming emissions. Rather, we need an innovation orientation based on understanding consumers' fundamental physical and informational needs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Household fuel use in developing countries, particularly as biomass and coal, is a major source of carbonaceous aerosols and other air pollutants affecting health and climate. Using state-of-the-art emission inventories, a global three-dimensional photochemical tracer/transport model of the troposphere, and a global radiative transfer model based on methods presented in the latest IPCC Assessment Report (2007-AR4), we estimate the radiative forcing (RF) attributable to household fuel combustion in Asia in terms of current global annual-mean RF and future global integrated RF for a one-year pulse of emissions (2000) over two time horizons (100 and 20 years). Despite the significant emissions of black carbon (BC) aerosols, these estimates indicate that shorter-lived (non-Kyoto) air pollutants from household fuel use in the region overall seem to exert a small net negative RF because of the strong influence of reflective aerosols. There are, however, major uncertainties in emission estimates for solid fuel burning, and about the sustainability of household fuel wood harvesting in Asia (the carbon neutrality of harvesting). In addition, there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the BC radiative forcing. As a result we find that the sign of the RF from household biomass burning in the region cannot be established. While recognizing the value of integrating climate change and air pollution policies, we are concerned that for a 'Kyoto style' post-Kyoto treaty (with global cap-and-trade and the Global Warming Potential as the metric) expanding the basket of components with a selection of short-lived species without also including the wider range of co-emitted species may lead to unintended consequences for global-scale climate. Additional measurement, modelling, and policy research is urgently needed to reduce the uncertainties so that the net impact on climate of emissions and mitigation measures in this sector can be accurately assessed.

"The response of tropical cyclone activity to global warming is widely debated(1-10). It is often assumed that warmer sea surface temperatures provide a more favourable environment for the development and intensification of tropical cyclones, but cyclone genesis and intensity are also affected by the vertical thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere(1,10-13). Here we use climate models and observational reconstructions to explore the relationship between changes in sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone 'potential intensity' - a measure that provides an upper bound on cyclone intensity(10-14) and can also reflect the likelihood of cyclone development(15,16). We find that changes in local sea surface temperature are inadequate for characterizing even the sign of changes in potential intensity, but that long- term changes in potential intensity are closely related to the regional structure of warming; regions that warm more than the tropical average are characterized by increased potential intensity, and vice versa. We use this relationship to reconstruct changes in potential intensity over the twentieth century from observational reconstructions of sea surface temperature. We find that, even though tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures are currently at a historical high, Atlantic potential intensity probably peaked in the 1930s and 1950s, and recent values are near the historical average. Our results indicate that - per unit local sea surface temperature change - the response of tropical cyclone activity to natural climate variations, which tend to involve localized changes in sea surface temperature, may be larger than the response to the more uniform patterns of greenhouse- gas- induced warming.",1
"Growing global trade with organic products has increased the demand for environmental impact assessments during both production and transport. Environmental hotspots of organic soybeans produced in China and imported to Denmark were identified in a case study using a life cycle assessment approach. Furthermore, environmental impacts of organic and conventional soybeans at farm gate were compared in the case study. The total global warming potential (GWP) per ton organic soybeans imported to Denmark revealed that 51% came from transportation and 35% from the farm level. Comparing organic and conventional soybean at farm gate showed that GWP, non-renewable energy use, acidification and eutrophication was lower per ton organic soybeans, whereas land use was slightly higher.

"Global warming is a reality which was acknowledged by governments at the Rio Summit in 1992 and at Kyoto in 1997. Tropical deforestation is emitting CO2 to the atmosphere, and a similar amount of CO2 is being removed from the atmosphere by the growth of forests elsewhere in the world, plus the acceleration of plant growth by increasing CO2 and N supply. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considered it possible to increase afforestation to offset 7.5% of the carbon that is likely to be emitted by burning fossil fuels up to 2050. Individual countries are claiming forest carbon sinks to offset some of their requirement to cut fossil fuel emissions. Also, some companies are starting independent carbon offset projects. The negotiators at Kyoto agreed very limited carbon sink credits in 'Kyoto forests' which must have been created since 1990. However, there are problems with estimation, definition, verification and associated unintended or undesirable effects, which are currently being examined by the IPCC.",1
"The pelagic ocean harbors one of the largest ecosystems on Earth. It is responsible for approximately half of global primary production, sustains worldwide fisheries, and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Ocean warming caused by anthropogenic climate change is already starting to impact the marine biota, with possible consequences for ocean productivity and ecosystem services. Because temperature sensitivities of marine autotrophic and heterotrophic processes differ greatly, ocean warming is expected to cause major shifts in the flow of carbon and energy through the pelagic system. Attempts to integrate such biological responses into marine ecosystem and biogeochemical models suffer from a lack of empirical data. Here, we show, using an indoor-mesocosm approach, that rising temperature accelerates respiratory consumption of organic carbon relative to autotrophic production in a natural plankton community. Increasing temperature by 2-6 degrees C hence decreased the biological drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface layer by up to 31%. Moreover, warming shifted the partitioning between particulate and dissolved organic carbon toward an enhanced accumulation of dissolved compounds. In line with these findings, the loss of organic carbon through sinking was significantly reduced at elevated temperatures. The observed changes in biogenic carbon flow have the potential to reduce the transfer of primary produced organic matter to higher trophic levels, weaken the ocean's biological carbon pump, and hence provide a positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2.",1
"Regional specificities are a key factor when analyzing the environmental impact of a biofuel pathway through a life cycle assessment (LCA). Due to different energy mixes, transport distances, agricultural practices and land use changes, results can significantly vary from one country to another. The Republic of Argentina is the first exporter of soybean oil and meal and the third largest soybean producer in the world, and therefore, soybean-based biodiesel production is expected to significantly increase in the near future, mostly for exportation. Moreover, Argentinean biodiesel producers will need to evaluate the environmental performances of their product in order to comply with sustainability criteria being developed. However, because of regional specificities, the environmental performances of this biofuel pathway can be expected to be different from those obtained for other countries and feedstocks previously studied. This work aims at analyzing the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina for export. The relevant impact categories account for the primary non-renewable energy consumption (CED), the global warming potential (GWP), the eutrophication potential (EP), the acidification potential (AP), the terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), the aquatic ecotoxicity (AE), the human toxicity (HT) and land use competition (LU). The paper tackles the feedstock and country specificities in biodiesel production by comparing the results of soybean-based biodiesel in Argentina with other reference cases. Emphasis is put on explaining the factors that contribute most to the final results and the regional specificities that lead to different results for each biodiesel pathway. The Argentinean (AR) biodiesel pathway was modelled through an LCA and was compared with reference cases available in the ecoinventA (R) 2.01 database, namely, soybean-based biodiesel production in Brazil (BR) and the United States (US), rapeseed-based biodiesel production in the European Union (EU) and Switzerland (CH) and palm-oil-based biodiesel production in Malaysia (MY). In all cases, the systems were modelled from feedstock production to biodiesel use as B100 in a 28 t truck in CH. Furthermore, biodiesel pathways were compared with fossil low-sulphur diesel produced and used in CH. The LCA was performed according to the ISO standards. The life cycle inventory and the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) were performed in Excel spreadsheets using the ecoinventA (R) 2.01 database. The cumulative energy demand (CED) and the GWP were estimated through the CED for fossil and nuclear energy and the IPCC 2001 (climate change) LCIA methods, respectively. Other impact categories were assessed according to CML 2001, as implemented in ecoinvent. As the product is a fuel for transportation (service), the system was defined for one vehicle kilometre (functional unit) and was divided into seven unit processes, namely, agricultural phase, soybean oil extraction and refining, transesterification, transport to port, transport to the destination country border, distribution and utilisation. The Argentinean pathway results in the highest GWP, CED, AE and HT compared with the reference biofuel pathways. Compared with the fossil reference, all impact categories are higher for the AR case, except for the CED. The most significant factor that contributes to the environmental impact in the Argentinean case varies depending on the evaluated category. Land provision through deforestation for soybean cultivation is the most impacting factor of the AR biodiesel pathway for the GWP, the CED and the HT categories. Whilst nitrogen oxide emissions during the fuel use are the main cause of acidification, nitrate leaching during soybean cultivation is the main factor of eutrophication. LU is almost totally affected by arable land occupation for soybean cultivation. Cypermethrin used as pesticide in feedstock production accounts for almost the total impact on TE and AE. The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase of 10% in the soybean yield, whilst keeping the same inputs, will reduce the total impact of the system. Avoiding deforestation is the main challenge to improve the environmental performances of soybean-based biodiesel production in AR. If the soybean expansion can be done on marginal and set-aside agricultural land, the negative impact of the system will be significantly reduced. Further implementation of crops' successions, soybean inoculation, reduced tillage and less toxic pesticides will also improve the environmental performances. Using ethanol as alcohol in the transesterification process could significantly improve the energy balance of the Argentinean pathway. The main explaining factors depend on regional specificities of the system that lead to different results from those obtained in the reference cases. Significantly different results can be obtained depending on the level of detail of the input data, the use of punctual or average data and the assumptions made to build up the LCA inventory. Further improvement of the AR biodiesel pathways should be done in order to comply with international sustainability criteria on biofuel production. Due to the influence of land use changes in the final results, more efforts should be made to account for land use changes others than deforestation. More data are needed to determine the part of deforestation attributable to soybean cultivation. More efforts should be done to improve modelling of interaction between variables and previous crops in the agricultural phase, future transesterification technologies and market prices evolution. In order to assess more accurately the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina, further considerations should be made to account for indirect land use changes, domestic biodiesel consumption and exportation to other regions, production scale and regional georeferenced differentiation of production systems.",1
"Historic climate data and repeat photographs were used to assess and document changes in alpine treeline and glacial recession in northwestern Yunnan, China. Results show that mean annual temperature in the last two decades of the 20th century has been increasing locally at a rate of 0.06 degrees C yr(-1) (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the annual trend is a result of both summer- and wintertime warming (0.037 degrees C yr(-1), p < 0.001; and 0.036 degrees C yr(-1), p < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, a local drying trend (-3.80 mm yr(-1); P < 0.001) was observed during the period 1955-1995. Repeat photos and supplemental measurements show that this warming is causing the retreat of glaciers and contributing to the elevational advance of alpine treeline. Fire, a traditional management tool used to halt the advance of woody species, has been suppressed since 1988. One consequence of these interactions is the encroachment of woody vegetation into alpine meadows, which will have negative impacts on plant species diversity and Tibetan livelihood. Two spatially and temporally distant anthropogenic actions, a rapidly warming climate and local land use policy, appear to be threatening both biodiversity and Tibetan livelihoods. Land managers need to recognize that global warming is occurring and adapt their conservation practices and policies to anticipate and be resilient to threats at all critical scales.",1
"One of the most pressing environmental issues today is the possibility that projected increases in global emissions of greenhouse gases from increased deforestation, development, and fossil-fuel combustion could significantly alter global climate patterns. Under the terms of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed in Rio de Janeiro during the June 1992 Earth Summit, the United States and other industrialized countries committed to balancing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels in the year 2000. Included in the treaty is a provision titled ''Joint Implementation,'' whereby industrialized countries assist developing countries in jointly modifying long-term emission trends, either through emission reductions or by protecting and enhancing greenhouse gas sinks (carbon sequestration). The US Climate Action Plan, signed by President Clinton in 1993, calls for voluntary climate change mitigation measures by various sectors, and the action plan included a new program, the US Initiative on Joint implementation. Wisconsin Electric decided to invest in a JI project because its concept encourages creative, cost-effective solutions to environmental problems through partnering, international cooperation, and innovation. The project chosen, a forest preservation and management effort in Belize, will sequester more than five million tons of carbon dioxide over a 40-year period, will become economically self-sustaining after ten years, and will have substantial biodiversity benefits.",1
"There has been a growing concern on the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, whose consequence is global warming. The sources of greenhouse gases have been identified, of which the major contributor is the combustion of fossil fuel. Researchers have intensified efforts towards identifying greener alternative fuel substitutes for the present fossil fuel. Natural gas is now being investigated as potential alternative fuel for diesel engines. Natural gas appears more attractive due to its high octane number and perhaps, due to its environmental friendly nature. The test results showed that alternative fuels exhibit longer ignition delay, with slow burning rates. Longer delays will lead to unacceptable rates of pressure rise with the result of diesel knock. This work examines the effect of advanced injection timing on the emission characteristics of dual-fuel engine. The engine has standard injection timing of 30 degrees BTDC. The injection was first advanced by 5.5 degrees and given injection timing of 35.5 degrees BTDC. The engine performance was erratic on this timing. The injection was then advanced by 3.5 degrees. The engine performance was smooth on this timing especially at low loading conditions. The ignition delay was reduced through advanced injection timing but tended to incur a slight increase in fuel consumption. The CO and CO2 emissions were reduced through advanced injection timing.

"Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant gaseous end products of the remineralization of organic carbon and also the two largest contributors to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. We investigated whether warming altered the balance of CH4 efflux relative to gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) in a freshwater mesocosm experiment. Whole ecosystem CH4 efflux was strongly related to temperature with an apparent activation energy of 0.85 eV. Furthermore, CH4 efflux increased faster than ER or GPP with temperature, with all three processes having sequentially lower activation energies. Warming of 4 degrees C increased the fraction of GPP effluxing as CH4 by 20% and the fraction of ER as CH4 by 9%, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because CH4 is 21 times more potent as a greenhouse gas, relative to CO2, these results suggest freshwater ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle.",1
"Plausible estimates for the effect of soot on snow and ice albedos (5% in the Arctic and 3% in Northern Hemisphere land areas) yield a climate forcing of +0.3 W/m(2) in the Northern Hemisphere. The ""efficacy"" of this forcing is approximate to2, i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO2 in altering global surface air temperature. This indirect soot forcing may have contributed to global warming of the past century, including the trend toward early springs in the Northern Hemisphere, thinning Arctic sea ice, and melting land ice and permafrost. If, as we suggest, melting ice and sea level rise define the level of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, then reducing soot emissions, thus restoring snow albedos to pristine high values, would have the double benefit of reducing global warming and raising the global temperature level at which dangerous anthropogenic interference occurs. However, soot contributions to climate change do not alter the conclusion that anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been the main cause of recent global warming and will be the predominant climate forcing in the future.",1
"The concept of capturing carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants and utilizing it as a flooding agent for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes is currently drawing much interest from oil, utility and coal companies in Western Canada. Implementation of such a scheme would provide two important benefits: (i) the captured CO2 could be marketed as a flooding agent which would generate revenues, and (ii) CO2 emissions to the atmosphere would be reduced. Since CO2 emissions are considered to be the main contributor to the possible serious environmental problem of global warming, the proposed scheme could become an important instrument to reduce such emissions at minimal incremental cost to the environment. This paper demonstrates how cogeneration concepts, together with process optimization strategies, help to reduce the CO2 production cost by utilizing low-pressure steam and waste heat from various sections of the power generation process. Based on these concepts and strategies, results from this study show that the recovery cost of CO2 from a coal-fired power plant can range between $0.50-2.00/mscf. If the cost is approximately $25/mscf, the production cost of a barrel of incremental oil would be less than $12. Therefore, even at today's modest oil prices, there is room for profit to be made operating a CO2 flood with flue gas extracted CO2. The technical and economical feasibility of the concepts are evaluated and the practical implications for the Canadian resources are discussed.",1
"Methane emissions from ruminant livestock are considered to be one of the more potent forms of greenhouses gases contributing to global warming. Many strategies to reduce emissions are targeting the methanogens that inhabit the rumen, but such an approach can only be successful if it targets all the major groups of ruminant methanogens. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the diversity of these microbes in breeds of buffaloes, as well as in response to geographical location and different diets, is required. Therefore, molecular diversity of rumen methanogens in Surti buffaloes was investigated using 16S rRNA gene libraries prepared from pooled rumen contents from three Surti buffaloes. A total of 171 clones were identified revealing 23 different sequences (phylotypes). Of these 23 sequences, twelve sequences (12 OTUs, 83 clones) and 10 sequences (10 OTUs, 83 clones) were similar to methanogens belonging to the orders Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales, and the remaining 1 phylotype (5 clones) were similar to Methanosarcina barkeri. These unique sequences clustered within a distinct and strongly supported phylogenetic group. Further studies and effective strategies can be made to inhibit the growth of Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales phylotypes to reduce the methane emission from rumen and thus help in preventing global warming.",1
"A complex earth system model, simulating atmosphere and ocean dynamics, marine biogeochemistry, terrestrial vegetation and ice sheets, was used to study feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and climate with a set of long-term climate change ensemble experiments. CO2 emissions were assigned according to historical data and the IPCC SRES scenarios B1, A1B and A2, followed by an exponential decay of the emissions for the period 2100-3000. The experiments give a reasonable reconstruction of the measured CO2 concentrations between 1750 and 2000. Maximum atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 520 ppm (B1), 860 ppm (A1B) and 1680 ppm (A2) were reached between 2200 and 2500. Additional experiments were performed with CO2 emissions and suppressed climate change, as well as an experiment with a prescribed land surface. The experiments were repeated with the vegetation model driven offline, to investigate the effects of climate and CO2 changes separately. The biogeochemical and biogeophysical interactions between terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere were quantified and compared. A decrease of albedo at high latitudes was the most important biogeophysical change. For the A2 scenario experiment, it causes an additional temperature increase of 1 to 2 K for some high latitude regions by the year 3000, but the changes are minor compared to the heating due to CO2 increase. The terrestrial biosphere takes up between 15 and 30% of the CO2 emissions, depending on the scenario and the period considered. The carbon is stored in the tropics and subtropics, where carbon is stored fast, and in the high latitudes, where carbon storage, partly due to forest expansion, is Much slower. By the year 3000, the storage of terrestrial carbon results in a decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentration of 400 ppm, which in turn decreases the global temperature increase by 0.4 K.

"This article discusses the potential use of biogas from municipal landfills to fuel urban heat space in Turkey. Biogas can be obtained from digesting the organic material of municipal solid wastes (MSW). The composition of MSW varies by the source of waste; however, in all cases the major constituents of MSW are organic in nature and the organics account for more than 50% of MSW. The main constituents of landfill gas are methane and carbon dioxide, both of which are major contributors to global warming. The generation of methane is worthwhile after one year from the start of the landfill operation. The compositional characteristics of MSW vary considerably from the large cities to the small towns and regions in Turkey. The social and demographic factors for each region are very different.",1
"Although an increasing frequency of forest fires has been suggested as a consequence of global warming, there are no empirical data that have shown climatically driven increases in fire frequency since the warming that has followed the end of the ''Little Ice Age'' (similar to 1850). In fact, a 300-year fire history (AD 1688-1988) from the Lac Duparquet area (48 degrees 28'N, 79 degrees 17'W) shows a significant decrease both in the number and extent of fires starting 100 years ago during a period of warming. To explore this relationship between climatic change and fire frequency we used daily data from the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service's General Circulation Model to calculate components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System for the 1xCO(2) and 2xCO(2) scenarios. The average FWI over much of eastern Canada, including the Lac Duparquet region, decreased under the 2xCO(2) simulation, whereas FWI increased dramatically over western Canada. According to these results, fire frequency would decrease over the southeastern boreal forest which is in agreement with the empirical data from the fire history. Our results stress the importance of large regional variability and call into question previous generalisations suggesting universal increases in the rate of disturbance with climate warming.",1
"Soil respiration is indicative of biological status of the soil and high respiration is correlated to high contents of available carbon (C) in soil and/or organic matter content. Because of soil respiration's relationship to soil organic matter status and content, soil respiration is considered one measurement that could aid in determining the quality of soil. In the global scale, the cycling of C in soil is important because the rise in CO2 in the atmosphere is linked to global climate change. In situ measurement of CO2 using instruments that are portable and perform analyses quickly are important to obtain sufficient number of measurements in the field to overcome spatial variability. Soil respiration tests were conducted in plots amended with fertilizer or organic amendments of agricultural or municipal residues since 1994. Besides CO2 moisture and temperature were measured over a period where the moisture varied from near saturation to below wilting point. It was found that flux was curvilinearly related to moisture from 5 to 40% (v/v). Maximum flux occurred for all plots between 30 and 40% saturation. The ratio of flux normalized by temperature to the volumetric soil moisture divided soils into two categories, those with soil organic matter (SOM) content above or below 4.5%. The determinations of CO2 flux, moisture and temperature uses equipment that is portable so that several sites in a field can be analyzed to reduce spatial variation. The only limitation is that the determinations must be performed on soils with less than 40% saturation or 25% moisture (v/v) because the normalized function is no longer linear above this moisture content. More than two SOM categories might be found if studies are expanded to soils with a wider range of SOM content.",1
"Synthesis and validation of crop models for assessment of of the impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and anticipated global warming on crop production require crop response data obtained under field-like conditions, The temperature gradient chamber (TGC) with the facility for CO2 enrichment allows the creation of various CO2 and temperature regimes for crops over the entire growth period with relatively inexpensive construction and running costs, The TGC develops a temperature gradient along its longitudinal axis using solar energy during the day and heating at night while maintaining the natural diurnal cycle, The temperature gradient and the CO2 concentration in the TGC are regulated by computer control of the air ventilation rate through the TGC and of the CO2 release rate, Longitudinal gradients of CO2 concentration and water vapour pressure deficit of air in the TGC were generally less than 5% and +/-0.2 kPa, respectively. A CO2 enrichment experiment on rice in the TGC showed that a doubling of the CO2 concentration markedly enhanced crop dry matter production, Temperature had less effect on dry matter production, although panicle dry weight was greatly decreased at higher temperature as a result of high-temperature-induced sterility of rice spikelets, Since rice spikelets are most sensitive to high temperature at the moment of flowering, and their flowering habit is highly synchronized with the diurnal courses of environmental conditions, the TGC is a useful tool in understanding rice responses to changes in atmosphere and temperature.",1
"Global warming resulting from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the local climate changes that follow affect local hydrospheric and biospheric environments. These include lakes that serve surrounding populations as a fresh water resource or provide regional navigation. Although there may well be steady water-quality alterations in the lakes with time, many of these are very much climate-change dependent. During cool and wet periods, there may be water-level rises that may cause economic losses to agriculture and human activities along the lake shores. Such rises become nuisances especially in the case of shoreline settlements and low-lying agricultural land. Lake Van, in eastern Turkey currently faces such problems due to water-level rises. The lake is unique for at least two reasons. First, it is a closed basin with no natural or artificial outlet and second, its waters contain high concentrations of soda which prevent the use of its water as a drinking or agricultural water source. Consequently, the water level fluctuations are entirely dependent on the natural variability of the hydrological cycle and any climatic change affects the drainage basin. In the past, the lake-level fluctuations appear to have been rather systematic and unrepresentable by mathematical equations. Herein, monthly polygonal climate diagrams are constructed to show the relation between lake level and some meteorological variables, as indications of significant and possible climatic changes. This procedure is applied to Lake Van, eastern Turkey, and relevant interpretations are presented.",1
" We have included climate-sensitive methane emissions from wetlands within the GISS climate model using a linear parameterization derived from a detailed process model. The geographic distribution of wetlands is also climate dependent. Doubled CO2 simulations using this model show an increase in annual average wetland methane emissions from 156 to 277 Tg/yr, a rise of 78%. The bulk of this increase is due to enhanced emissions from existing tropical wetlands. Additionally, high northern latitude wetland areas expand and emissions nearly triple during Northern summer. The global increase represents -20% of present-day inventories. These large values indicate that the potential response of natural emissions to climate change merit greater study, and should be included in projections of future global warming and tropospheric pollution.",1
"A transient CO2 experiment using the ARPEGE/ OPAICE coupled general circulation model with no flux correction has been performed at CERFACS. Despite a warm initial climate drift, the main features of the observed climate are reasonably captured in the control simulation. In particular, the simulated oceanic circulation is satisfactory. The transient CO2 simulation shows a global warming of 6 degrees C in surface air temperature at the time of CO2 doubling. This value and the main geographical patterns of climate change are in agreement with previous studies using either flux corrected or non flux corrected models. The absence of flux correction does not prevent the too strong atmospheric water fluxes to produce an unrealistic freshening of the upper layer of the Northern North Atlantic which leads to a reduction of the thermohaline circulation in the control simulation. As a consequence, the weakening of the thermohaline circulation in response to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is less than expected.",1
"The food production system as a whole is recognized as one of the major contributors to environmental impacts. Accordingly, food production, processing, transport and consumption account for a relevant portion of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with any country. In this context, there is an increasing market demand for climate-relevant information regarding the global warming impact of consumer food products throughout the supply chains. This article deals with the assessment of the carbon footprint of seafood products as a key subgroup in the food sector. Galicia (NW Spain) was selected as a case study. The analysis is based on a representative set of species within the Galician fishing sector, including species obtained from coastal fishing (e.g. horse mackerel, Atlantic mackerel, European pilchard and blue whiting), offshore fishing (e.g. European hake, megrim and anglerfish), deep-sea fishing (skipjack and yellowfin tuna), extensive aquaculture (mussels) and intensive aquaculture (turbot). The carbon footprints associated with the production-related activities of each selected species were quantified following a business-to-business approach on the basis of 1 year of fishing activity. These individual carbon footprints were used to calculate the carbon footprint for each of the different Galician fisheries and culture activities. Finally, the lump sum of the carbon footprints for coastal, offshore and deep-sea fishing and extensive and intensive aquaculture brought about the carbon footprint of the Galician fishing activity (i.e., capture and culture). A benchmark for quantifying and communicating emission reductions was then provided, and opportunities to reduce the GHG emissions associated with the Galician fishing activity could be prioritized.

"Beginning with Brazil and the US, biofuels are being produced in a growing number of countries at large scale. Jobs are created in rural areas, air quality improves in urban areas, global warming is mitigated, oil imports decrease, and foreign exchange is saved. Nevertheless, the expansion of biofuels in large scale raises concerns about the environmental impact at the production sites, the competition with food supplies, the threats to existing eco-systems such as the rain forests, etc., and maintaining fair social standards. Not every country in the world should be producing biofuels. Only a discrete number of countries should engage in biofuels production, mainly in the developing world. But, all countries can benefit from consuming biofuels. All energy commodities today are traded internationally, without restrictions, except biofuels. Interested countries must discuss and agree on a Global BioPact, to promote unimpeded international trade of biofuels within the bounds of sustainable production, transport, and use. Such trade will improve the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of biofuels.",1
"Increasing attention is being focused on the rapid rise Of CO(2) levels in the atmosphere, which many believe to be the major contributing factor to global climate change. Sequestering CO(2) in deep geological formations has been proposed as a long-term solution to help stabilize CO(2) levels. However, before such technology can be developed and implemented, a basic understanding of H(2)O-CO(2) systems and the chemical interactions of these fluids with the host formation must be obtained. Important issues concerning mineral stability, reaction rates, and carbonate formation are all controlled or at least significantly impacted by the kinetics of rock-water reactions in mildly acidic, CO(2)-saturated solutions. Basalt has recently been identified as a potentially important host formation for geological sequestration. Dissolution kinetics of the Columbia River Basalt (CRB) were measured for a range of temperatures (25-90 degrees C) under mildly acidic to neutral pH conditions using the single-pass flow-through test method. Under anaerobic conditions, the normalized dissolution rates for CRB decrease with increasing pH (3 <= pH <= 7) with a slope, eta, of -0.15 +/- 0.0 Activation energy, E(a), has been estimated at 32.0 +/- 2.4 kJ mol(-1). Dissolution kinetics measurements like these are essential for modeling the rate at which CO(2)-saturated fluids react with basalt and ultimately drive conversion rates to carbonate minerals in situ.

"Climate change represents a major challenge to the maintenance of global biodiversity. To date, the direction and magnitude of net changes in the global distribution of plant diversity remain elusive. We use the empirical multi-variate relationships between contemporary water-energy dynamics and other non-climatic predictor variables to model the regional capacity for plant species richness (CSR) and its projected future changes. We find that across all analysed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenarios, relative changes in CSR increase with increased projected temperature rise. Between now and 2100, global average CSR is projected to remain similar to today (+0.3%) under the optimistic B1/+8 degrees C scenario, but to decrease significantly (-9.4%) under the 'business as usual' A1FI/+4.0 degrees C scenario. Across all modelled scenarios, the magnitude and direction of CSR change are geographically highly non-uniform. While in most temperate and arctic regions, a CSR increase is expected, the projections indicate a strong decline in most tropical and subtropical regions. Countries least responsible for past and present greenhouse gas emissions are likely to incur disproportionately large future losses in CSR, whereas industrialized countries have projected moderate increases. Independent of direction, we infer that all changes in regional CSR will probably induce on-site species turnover and thereby be a threat to native floras.",1
"The upper Paleocene and lower Eocene are marked by several prominent (>1%.) carbon isotope (delta(13)C) excursions (CIE) that coincide with transient global warmings, or thermal maxima, including the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The CIE, which are recorded mainly in marine sedimentary sequences, have also been identified in continental sequences, occurred episodically, and yet appear to be paced or triggered by orbital forcing. To constrain the timing and scale of the CIE relative to long-term baseline variability, we have constructed a 4.52 million year (myr) long, high-resolution (similar to 3 kyr) bulk sediment carbon isotope record spanning the lower Eocene to upper Paleocene (C25r-C24n) from a pelagic sediment section recovered at ODP Site 1262 in the southeast Atlantic. This section, which was orbitally-tuned utilizing high-resolution core log physical property and geochemical records, is the most stratigraphically complete upper Paleocene to lower Eocene sequence recovered to date. Time-series analysis of the carbon isotope record along with a high-resolution Fe intensity record obtained by XRF core scanner reveal cyclicity with variance concentrated primarily in the precession (21 kyr) and eccentricity bands (100 and 400-kyr) throughout the upper Paleocene-lower Eocene. In general, minima in delta(13)C correspond with peaks in Fe (i.e., carbonate dissolution), both of which appear to be in phase with maxima in eccentricity. This covariance is consistent with excess oceanic uptake of isotopically depleted carbon resulting in lower carbonate saturation during periods of high eccentricity. This relationship includes all late Paleocene and early Eocene CIE confirming pacing by orbital forcing. The lone exception is the PETM, which appears to be out of phase with the 400-kyr cycle, though possibly in phase with the 100-kyr cycle, reinforcing the notion that a mechanism other than orbital forcing and/or an additional source of carbon is required to account for the occurrence and unusual scale of this event.

"It has been well documented that restored wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America do store carbon. However, the net benefit of carbon sequestration in wetlands in terms of a reduction in global warming forcing has often been questioned because of potentially greater emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and methane (CH(4)). We compared gas emissions (N(2)O, CH(4), carbon dioxide [CO(2)]) and soil moisture and temperature from eight cropland and eight restored grassland wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region from May to October, 2003, to better understand the atmospheric carbon mitigation potential of restored wetlands. Results show that carbon dioxide contributed the most (90%) to net-GHG flux, followed by CH(4) (9%) and N(2)O (1%). Fluxes of N(2)O, CH(4), CO(2), and their combined global warming potential (CO(2) equivalents) did not significantly differ between cropland and grassland wetlands. The seasonal pattern in flux was similar in cropland and grassland wetlands with peak emissions of N(2)O and CH(4) occurring when soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) was 40-60% and >60%, respectively; negative CH(4) fluxes were observed when WFPS approached 40%. Negative CH(4) fluxes from grassland wetlands occurred earlier in the season and were more pronounced than those from cropland sites because WFPS declined more rapidly in grassland wetlands; this decline was likely due to higher infiltration and evapotranspiration rates associated with grasslands. Our results suggest that restoring cropland wetlands does not result in greater emissions of N(2)O and CH(4), and therefore would not offset potential soil carbon sequestration. These findings, however, are limited to a small sample of seasonal wetlands with relatively short hydroperiods. A more comprehensive assessment of the GHG mitigation potential of restored wetlands should include a diversity of wetland types and land-use practices and consider the impact of variable climatic cycles that affect wetland hydrology.

"The major contributor to global warming is considered to be the high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), caused by the burning of fossil fuel. Thus, to mitigate CO2 emissions, renewable energy sources such as ethanol have been seen as a promising alternative to fossil fuel consumption. Brazil was the world's first nation to run a large-scale program for using ethanol as fuel. Eventually, the United States also developed large-scale production of ethanol. In this study, we compare the benefits and environmental impacts of ethanol fuel, in Brazil and in the United States, using the ecological footprint tool developed by Wackernagel and Rees. We applied the STELLA model to gauge possible outcomes as a function of variations in the ethanol production scenario.",1
"The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to the recycling of wood waste have been assessed with the purpose to provide useful data that can be used in accounting of greenhouse gas emissions. Here we present data related to the activities in a material recovery facility (MRF) where wood waste is shredded and foreign objects are removed in order to produce wood chips for use in the production of particleboard. The data are presented in accordance with the UOD (upstream, operational, downstream) framework presented in Gentil et al. (Waste Management & Research, 27, 2009). The GHG accounting shows that the emissions related to upstream activities (5 to 41 kg CO(2)-equivalents tonne(-1) wood waste) and to activities at the MRF (approximately 5 kg CO(2)-equivalents tonne(-1) wood waste) are negligible compared to the downstream processing (-560 to -120 kg CO(2)-equivalents tonne-1 wood waste). The magnitude of the savings in GHG emissions downstream are mainly related to savings in energy consumption for drying of fresh wood for particleboard production. However, the GHG account highly depends on the choices made in the modelling of the downstream system. The inclusion of saved electricity from avoided chipping of virgin wood does not change the results radically (-665 to -125 kg CO(2)-equivalents tonne(-1) wood waste). However, if in addition it is assumed that the GHG emissions from combustion of wood has no global warming potential (GWP) and that the energy produced from excess wood due to recycling substitutes energy from fossil fuels, here assumed to be coal, potentially large downstream GHG emissions savings can be achieved by recycling of waste wood (-9 to -3 tonnes CO(2)-equivalents tonne(-1) wood waste). As the data ranges are broad, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the feasibility of the data in the specific system which the GHG accounting is to be applied to.",1
"It is widely proposed that the global warming is mainly caused by the increase in of carbon dioxide (CO2) content in the atmosphere, and that fossil fuels are the dominant sources of this CO2. Therefore, the quality of fossil fuels tends to be evaluated by amounts of CO2 emissions. For the evaluation of an oil shale from this point an on-line thermogravimetric-gas chromatographic system was used to measure CO2 evolution profiles on temperature with a small oil shale sample. This method makes possible to estimate the amounts of CO2 evolved from kerogen and carbonates in retorting and those from carbonates in combustion, respectively. These results will be basic data for a novel oil shale retorting process for the control of CO2 emissions. The profiles for Thai and Colorado oil shales have shown CO2 mainly evolved by the pyrolysis of kerogen below 550 degrees C, and that evolved by the decomposition of carbonates above that temperature. On the other hand, the profile for Condor oil shale showed that most carbonates decomposed below 550 degrees C, while only small amounts of carbonates decomposed above this temperature.
