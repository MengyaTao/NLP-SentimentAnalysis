"Aim Evolutionary theory predicts that levels of genetic variation in island populations will be positively correlated with island area and negatively correlated with island isolation. These patterns have been empirically established for oceanic islands, but little is known about the determinants of variation on habitat islands. The goals of this study were twofold. Our first aim was to test whether published patterns of genetic variation in mammals occurring on montane habitat islands in the American Southwest conformed to expectations based on evolutionary theory. The second aim of this research was to develop simple heuristic models to predict changes in genetic variation that may occur in these populations as a result of reductions in available mountaintop habitat in response to global warming. Location Habitat islands of conifer forest on mountaintops in the American Southwest. Methods Relationships between island area and isolation with measures of allozyme variation in four species of small mammal, namely the least chipmunk (Tamias minimus), Colorado chipmunk (Tamias quadrivittatus), red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and Mexican woodrat (Neotoma mexicana), were determined using correlation and regression techniques. Significant relationships between island area and genetic variation were used to develop three distinct statistical models with which to predict changes in genetic variation following reduction in insular habitat area arising from global warming. Results Patterns of genetic variation in each species conformed to evolutionary predictions. In general, island area was the most important determinant of heterozygosity, while island isolation was the most important determinant of polymorphism and allelic diversity. The heuristic models predicted widespread reductions in genetic variation, the extent of which depended on the population and model considered. Main conclusions The results support a generalized pattern of genetic variation for any species with an insular distribution, with reduced variation in smaller, more isolated populations. We predict widespread reductions in genetic variation in isolated populations of montane small mammals in the American Southwest as a result of global warming. We conclude that climate-induced reductions in the various dimensions of genetic variation may increase the probability of population extinction in both the short and long term.",0
"Modern rates of sea level change are of interest because of concerns that global warming may be causing glacier retreat. Both tide gauges and satellite radar altimetry are used to measure the present rates of change in sea level. Tide gauges measure sea level relative to the ocean floor whereas the reference for satellite altimetry is the earth's center. A numerical model of deformation of the earth's solid surface and its geoid forced by melting ice sheets, both past and present, is used to predict the present rate of sea level change as measured by tide gauges and satellites. Sea level change observed by both tide gauges and satellites are predicted to be spatially nonuniform. Considering only past ice sheets tide gauges in glaciated regions would record a fall in sea level of -13 mm yr(-1), whereas satellite altimetry would record a rise in sea level of 0.7 mm yr(-1). In the region peripheral to the glaciated zone a tide gauge would record a rise in sea level (3 mm yr(-1)) in contrast to a predicted fall in sea level (-0.3 mm yr(-1)) recorded with satellite altimetry. Near regions once glaciated, the rate of sea level change as recorded by satellite decays more rapidly than the tide gauge sea level signature and so isostatic adjustment caused by past ice sheets contributes proportionately less to the modern rate of sea level change as measured by satellites than by tide gauges. At regions distant from glaciated areas both tide gauges and satellites would record a slight (-0.3 mm yr(-1)) sea level fall. The immediate elastic sea level response from melting of present ice sheets yields a similar signature for data from both tide gauges and satellite altimetry. Recorded sea level would fall near the meltwater source and at great distance from the source would rise approximately 122% of the oceanwide average sea level amount. Therefore glacio-isostatic processes will contaminate the sea level record measured by satellite less than the tide gauge record.",0
"Wastewater sludge containing cellulose from a paper manufacturing facility was saccharized using Meicelase (cellulase from Trichoderma viride). As a result of process optimization, maximum saccharification was obtained at pH 4.0, 40 degreesC, and 0.1 % enzyme concentration. After neutralization of hydrolysis products by acid, a Corynebacterium glutamicum inoculum and cultivation medium were added to the solution. Lactic acid and succinic acid, as major metabolic products, were synthesized in this reaction under anaerobic conditions by bubbling of carbon dioxide gas. Lactic acid was identified to be of L-form, which is useful as a starting material for the manufacture of biodegradable polymers such as poly lactic acid. Both these organic acids can also be converted to a wide variety of organic products. This production of organic acids was thus accompanied by CO, fixation. Paper sludge saccharification and organic acid production were done in the same reactor to reduce the reaction time and simplify the overall process by using Celluzyme (cellulase from Humicola microorganism), whose optimum activity is at around pH7. This study illustrates the use of biodegradable wastes in prevention of global warming.",0
"Sound-absorbing materials absorb most of the sound energy striking them, making them very useful for the control of noise. They are used in a variety of locations - close to sources of noise, in various paths, and sometimes close to receivers. Although all materials absorb some incident sound, the term ""acoustical material"" has been primarily applied to those materials that have been produced for the specific purpose of providing high values of absorption. The major uses of absorbing materials are almost invariably found to include the reduction of reverberant sound pressure levels and, consequently, the reduction of the reverberation time in enclosures, or rooms. A wide range of sound-absorbing materials exist. In the 1970s, public health concerns helped change the main constituents of sound-absorbing materials from asbestos-based materials to new synthetic fibers. Although, these new fibers are much safer for human health, more recently, issues related to global warming may increase the use of natural fibers instead of synthetic ones.",0
"We examined trends in accumulated winter chill across the fruit growing region of central California and its internal coastal valleys. We tested the hypothesis that global warming is in motion in California and is causing accumulated winter chill to decrease across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. The detection of potential trends in accumulated winter chill (between 0 and 7.2 degrees C) was determined using two complementary climate datasets. The California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) contains hourly climate data and is suitable for computing accumulated chill hours and chill degree-hours. But, its longest data records extend back only to the 1980s. The National Weather Service Coop climate record is longer, extending beyond the 1950s at many sites. But its datasets only contain information on daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To assess long term trends in winter chill accumulation, we developed an algorithm that converted information from daily maximum and minimum temperature into accumulated hours of winter chill and summations of chill-degree hours. These inferred calculations of chill hour accumulation were tested with and validated by direct measurements from hourly-based data from the CIMIS network. With the combined climate datasets, we found that the annual accumulation of winter chill hours and chill degree hours is diminishing across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. Observed trends in winter chill range between -50 and -260 chill hours per decade. We also applied out analytical algorithm to project changes in winter chill using regional climate projections of temperature for three regions in the Central Valley. Predicted rates of reduced winter chill, for the period between 1950 and 2100, are on the order of -40 h per decade. By the end of the 21st century, orchards in California are expected to experience less than 500 chill hours per winter. This chronic and steady reduction in winter chill is expected to have deleterious economic and culinary impact on fruit and nut production in California by the end of the 21st Century.",0
"Drought can have severe ecological effects and global climate-change theory predicts that droughts are likely to increase in frequency and severity. Therefore, it is important that we broaden our understanding of how drought affects not only individual species, but also multitrophic interactions. Here we document vegetation and small-mammal abundance and associated patterns of Texas ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta) body condition and survival before, during, and after a drought in central Texas, USA. Vegetation (grass and forbs) height and small-mammal capture rates were two times greater in wet years compared to the drought year. The decline of small mammals (the snakes' principal prey) during the drought was associated with a drop in ratsnake body condition, consistent with reduced food intake. During the drought, snake mortality also increased 24%. Although higher snake mortality was attributable to predation and road mortality rather than being a direct result of starvation, an increase in risk-prone behavior by foraging snakes probably increased their exposure to those other mortality factors. Drought conditions lasted only for 21 months, and vegetation, small- mammal abundance, and snake condition had returned to pre-drought levels within a year. Although estimates of snake population size were not available, it is likely that substantially more than a year was required for the population to return to its previous size.",0
"High-latitude warming could cause northern peatlands to become C sources. Where peattands border boreal forests, strong differences in ecosystem C balances reflect drainage differences. Because local drainage conditions could be influenced by alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, peatland-forest ecotones represent useful locations for monitoring potential impacts of global warming. We characterized the soils, hydrology, and forest structure along transects bracketing a peatland-forest ecotone in southeastern Alaska. We expected to find soil properties and processes at the peatland-forest edge that were intermediate between those from peatland and forest. Instead, we found that above- and belowground features of the ecotone did not coincide. Conifers grew on mineral soils, but also grew on Cryofibrists and Cryohemists, soils with high soil organic C (SOC) contents to 100 cm (57 kg m(-2)) that are significantly greater than the SOC contents of adjacent forested, non-Histosol pedons. Soil ;respiration rates (SRR) at peatland-forest edges (0.08 g CO(2)-C m(-2) h(-1)), by contrast, were threefold lower than forest rates and did not differ significantly from peatland rates. Respiration rates were strongly influenced by water table height. Peattand and edge water tables were both significantly shallower than forest water tables. Our conceptual model suggests that if additional forest expansion and warmer summers enhance drainage of these edge soils and stimulate SRR to forest-like levels, 23 kg C m(-2) could ultimately be mineralized from these extensive peatland-forest boundaries. Afforestation of peattand margins under this scenario could represent a transient positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO(2) levels.",0
" The response of large stores of carbon in boreal forest soils to global warming is a major uncertainty in predicting the future carbon budget. We measured the temperature dependence of decomposition for upland boreal peat under black spruce forest with sphagnum and feather moss understory using incubation experiments. CO2 efflux rates clearly responded to temperature, which ranged from -10degrees to +8degreesC by similar to2degreesC increments. At temperatures below 0degreesC, significant decomposition was observed in feather moss peat but not in wetter sphagnum peat. Above 0degreesC, decomposition was exponentially related to temperature, corresponding to a Q(10) (the ratio of the rate of CO2 evolution at one temperature divided by that at a temperature 10degreesC cooler) of 4.4 for feather moss and 3.1 for sphagnum peat. The greatest change in CO2 evolution rate with temperature occurred between -2degrees and 0degreesC, which coincided with the phase transition of soil water. We saw no large change in the rate of CO2 evolution between incubation experiments separated by a 6 month storage period for feather moss peat. Stable C isotope measurements of evolved CO2 and the rate of change of CO2 evolution with time suggest different substrates are used to sustain heterotrophic respiration above and below freezing. Radiocarbon signatures of CO2 respired from both types of peat reflected significant contributions from C fixed in the last 35 years (""bomb'' C-14) as well as C fixed prior to 1950. We observed no change in the Delta(14)C of respired CO2 with temperature. Isotopic signatures of peat components showed that a combination of substrates must contribute to the CO2 evolved in our incubations. Decomposition of fine roots (which made up less than 7% of the total peat C) accounted for similar to50% of respired CO2 in feather moss peat and for similar to30% of respired CO2 in sphagnum peat. Fine-grained (< 1 mm), more humified material that makes up 60-70% of the bulk peat organic carbon contributed significantly to heterotrophic respiration (similar to 30% in feather moss and similar to 50% in sphagnum moss peat), despite slow decomposition rates. Increased temperatures caused enhanced decomposition from all pools without changing their relative contributions. Because the contribution of peat decomposition is a small portion of total soil respiration at the study site, increased respiration rates would be difficult to measure as increased fluxes in the field. Nonetheless, sustained warming could lead to significant loss of C from these peat layers.",0
"Although much of the commercial sector infrastructure for the next century is currently under construction or is in the planning stages, little has been done in communicating how potential global warming might change the energy consumption characteristics of the building stock. The research discussed in this article advances the literature on how climate change affects commercial sector energy demand systems. It projects the effects of climate change on commercial energy demand in the United States at the national level. The article relies heavily on time-series regressions of monthly energy consumption by building on monthly heating and cooling degree days. It provides empirical results for the effects of climate on a projected building stock in the year 2030 and examines the prospects for saving energy with advanced building designs in the context of potential global warming.",0
"Purpose - This paper seeks to give a review of reasons for believing that the problem of global warming is more urgent than widely assumed, largely following the lead of a recent book by Lovelock. It is argued that increased use of nuclear power is the best course, especially if fusion power can be achieved. A short note is appended referring to a previous discussion of interactions with Islam. Design/methodology/approach - This is performed by a review of developments on the internet, especially those of general cybernetic interest. Findings - Global warming poses a real and immediate threat which can be partly offset by increased use of nuclear power. Practical implications - Increased use of nuclear power is not only warranted, but also vital, and achievement of practical fusion power would be an enormous bonus. Originality/value - Hopefully this is a valuable periodic review.",0
"Monarch butterflies overwinter in restricted areas in montane oyamel fir forests in central Mexico with specific microclimates that allow the butterflies to survive for up to 5 months. We use ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify areas adequate for overwintering monarch colonies under both current and future climate scenarios. The ENM approach permits testing and validation of model predictivity, and yields quantitative, testable predictions regarding likely future climate change effects. Our models predicted monarch presence with a high degree of accuracy, and indicated that precipitation and diurnal temperature range were key environmental factors in making locations suitable for monarchs. When we projected monarch distribution onto future climate scenarios (Hadley Centre climate models), we found that conditions were likely to be inadequate across the entire current winter range, particularly owing to increased cool-weather precipitation that could cause increased mortality. This study applies ENM to understanding the seasonal dynamics of a migratory species under climate change, and uses ENM to identify key limiting environmental parameters in species' responses to climate change.",0
"The 1997-1998 El-Nino Southern Oscillation was the most severe on record and dramatically impacted corals worldwide. However, the effect of this event on the associated community of reef organisms has received much less attention. The composition of the bryozoan assemblage from the coral reefs of Northern Bahia, Brazil were monitored annually from 1995 to 2000, allowing the investigation of the effects of this large-scale stressor on an important, diverse, yet understudied component of the coral reef system. Bryozoan samples (35 replicates/reef) were collected during April/May from four shallow bank reefs (10-40 In depth) located a few kilometres off the coast, together with measurements of the associated environmental parameters. Currently 157 species have been recorded from the study area, but significant reductions in density and diversity were apparent between pre- and post El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years, multivariate analysis denoting significant changes in assemblage composition. A total of 61 species were unrecorded following the 1997-1998 ENSO event (22 species from 1997; 25 further species from 1998 and 14 more from 1999). These included several species endemic to Brazil, suggesting that the 1997-1998 ENSO has had a marked influence on the reef bryozoan community, resulting in the local extinction of several species. Bryozoan mortalities were probably initiated by elevated temperatures, but continued disappearance of species for 2 years after ENSO suggests other indirect factors are also influential. These results demonstrate that ENSO events can have severe long-term impacts on the biodiversity of coral reefs, with important conservation consequences. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

"The radiative forcing and global warming potential of three important greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are derived using their absorption spectra at the Earth's surface and their number densities in the atmosphere. The calculated values are close to the IPCC estimates except for methane.",0
"With increasing concern over global climate change, policy makers are promoting renewable energy sources, predominantly wind generation, as a means of meeting emissions reduction targets. Although wind generation does not itself produce any harmful emissions, its effect on power system operation can actually cause an increase in the emissions of conventional plants. A dispatch model was developed that analyzes the impact that wind generation has on the operation of conventional plants and the resulting emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and oxides of nitrogen (NOX). The analysis concentrates on a ""forecasted"" approach that incorporates wind generation forecasts in the dispatch decisions. It was found that wind generation could be used as a tool for reducing CO2 emissions but alone, it was not effective in curbing SO2 and NOX emissions.",0
"In the context of global warming, it is a well-known fact that there is an increase in precipitation in middle latitudes. Convective phenomena have also been on the increase in the past few decades. It is gradually becoming more difficult to characterize climatic trends in middle latitudes. Data show that there may be different results depending on the study zones. Thus, it is interesting to study climatic changes in recent precipitation series, especially if we can have at our disposal a dense network of rainfall stations with reliable precipitation series. The analysis of precipitation series in 333 rainfall stations from 1961 to 1990 has revealed that summer precipitation shows a statistically significant trend in wide areas of Mainland Spain. In the months of July and August, the precipitation is exclusively convective. In those months, the precipitation increased in 20% of the southern areas, that is, in those areas where temperatures are on average higher. June and September present different trends showing a decrease in precipitation in 10% of the territory. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",0
"The authors present initial results of a new pan-European and international storminess since 1800 as interpreted from European and North Atlantic barometric pressure variability (SENABAR) project. This first stage analyzes results of a new daily pressure variability index, dp(abs) 24, from long-running meteorological stations in Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, some with data from as far back as the 1830s. It is shown that dp(abs) 24 is significantly related to wind speed and is therefore a good measure of Atlantic and Northwest European storminess and climatic variations. The authors investigate the temporal and spatial consistency of dp(abs) 24, the connection between annual and seasonal dp(abs) 24 and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), as well as dp(abs) 24 links with historical storm records. The results show periods of relatively high dp(abs) 24 and enhanced storminess around 1900 and the early to mid-1990s, and a relatively quiescent period from about 1930 to the early 1960s, in keeping with earlier studies. There is little evidence that the mid-to late nineteenth century was less stormy than the present, and there is no sign of a sustained enhanced storminess signal associated with ""global warming."" The results mark the first step of a project intending to improve on earlier work by linking barometric pressure data from a wide network of stations with new gridded pressure and reanalysis datasets, GCMs, and the NAOI. This work aims to provide much improved spatial and temporal coverage of changes in European, Atlantic, and global storminess.",0
"The recently reported increase in the proportion of intense hurricanes is considerably larger than those projected by the maximum potential intensity (MPI) theory and the results of numerical simulation. To reconcile this discrepancy, the authors examined the best-track datasets for the North Atlantic (NA), western North Pacific (WNP), and eastern North Pacific (ENP) basins. It was found that the changes in the tropical cyclone formation locations and prevailing tracks may have contributed to the changes in the proportion of the intense hurricanes over the past 30 yr. The authors suggest that the changes in the formation locations and prevailing tracks have a profound impact on the basinwide tropical cyclone intensity. Thus, how the atmospheric circulation in the tropical cyclone basins responds to the global warming may be a critical factor in understanding the impacts of global warming on tropical cyclone intensity.",0
"Global surface air temperature has increased about 0.5 degrees C from the minimum of mid-1992, a year after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Both a land-based surface air temperature record and a land-marine temperature index place the meteorological year 1995 at approximately the same level as 1990, previously the warmest year in the period of instrumental data. As El Nino warming was small in 1995, the solar cycle near a minimum, and ozone depletion near record levels, the observed high temperature supports the contention of an underlying global warming trend. The pattern of Northern Hemisphere temperature change in recent decades appears to reflect a change of atmospheric dynamics.",0
"The idea of deploying a lidar system on an Earth-orbiting satellite stems from the need for continuously providing profiles of our atmosphereis structure with high resolution and global coverage. Interest in this information for climatology, meteorology and the atmospheric sciences in general is huge. Areas of application range from the determination of global warming and greenhouse effects, to monitoring the transport and accumulation of pollutants in the different atmospheric regions (such as the recent fires in Southeast Asia), to the assessment of the largely unknown micro-physical properties and the structural dynamics of the atmosphere itself.",0
"In a forest ecosystem at steady state, net carbon (C) assimilation by plants and C loss through soil and litter decomposition by heterotrophic organisms are balanced. However, a perturbation to the system, such as increased mean soil temperature, will lead to faster decay, enhancing CO2 release from decomposers, and thus upsetting the balance. Recent in situ experiments have indicated that the stimulation of soil respiration following a step increase in annual average soil temperature declines over time. One possible explanation for this decline may be changes in substrate availability. This hypothesis is examined by using the ecosystem model G'DAY, which simulates C and nitrogen (N) dynamics in plants and soil. We applied the model to observations from a soil-warming experiment in a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand by simulating a step increase of soil temperature. The model provided a good qualitative reproduction of the observed reduction of heterotrophic respiration (R-h) under sustained warming. The simulations showed how the combined effects of faster turnover and reduced substrate availability lead to a transient increase of R-h. The simulated annual increase in R-h from soil was 60% in the first year after perturbation but decreased to 30% after a decade. One conclusion from the analysis of the simulations is that R-h can decrease even though the temperature response function for decomposition remains unchanged. G'DAY suggests that acclimation of R-h to soil warming is partly an effect of substrate depletion of labile C pools during the first decade of warming as a result of accelerated rates of mineralization. The response is attributed mainly to changing levels of C in pools with short time constants, reflecting the importance of high-quality soil C fractions. Changes of the structure or physiology of the decomposer community were not invoked. Therefore, it becomes a question of definition whether the simulated dynamics of the declining response of CO2 release to the warming should be named acclimation or seen as a natural part of the system dynamics.",0
"This paper is concerned with dendroclimatic research aimed at representing the history of very large-scale temperature changes. It describes recent analyses of the data from a widespread network of tree-ring chronologies, made up of ring width and densitometric measurement data spanning three to six centuries. The network was built over many years from trees selected to maximise their sensitivity to changing temperature. This strategy was adopted so that temperature reconstructions might be achieved at both regional and very large spatial scales. The focus here is on the use of one growth parameter: maximum latewood density (MXD). The detailed nature of the temperature sensitivity of MXD across the whole network has been explored and the dominant common influence of mean April-September temperature on MXD variability is demonstrated. Different approaches to reconstructing past temperature for this season include the production of detailed year-by-year gridded maps and wider regional integrations in the form of subcontinental and quasi-hemispheric-scale histories of temperature variability spanning some six centuries. These 'hemispheric' summer series can be compared with other reconstructions of temperature changes for the Northern Hemisphere over the last millennium. The tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions show the clear cooling effect of large explosive volcanic eruptions. They also exhibit greater century-timescale variability than is apparent in the other hemispheric series and suggest that the late 15th and the 16th centuries were cooler than indicated by some other data. However, in many tree-ring chronologies, we do not observe the expected rate of ring density increases that would be compatible with observed late 20th century warming. This changing climate sensitivity may be the result of other environmental factors that have, since the 1950s, increasingly acted to reduce tree-ring density below the level expected on the basis of summer temperature changes. This prevents us from claiming unprecedented hemispheric warming during recent decades on the basis of these tree-ring density data alone. Here we show very preliminary results of an investigation of the links between recent changes in MXD and ozone (the latter assumed to be associated with the incidence of UV radiation at the ground).

"The impacts of some high-pressure diecasting (HPDC) process parameters on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are quantified using life cycle analysis (LCA) for both aluminum and magnesium alloys. The study was conducted according to ISO 14040 standards and was based on an automotive component made on cold-chamber HPDC machines operating in typical mass production environments. The aluminum alloy foundry was located in Australia; the magnesium alloy foundry was located in the United States. In both cases, emissions were found to reduce with an increasing HPDC process yield. However, yield variations had only a modest impact on GHG emissions in the aluminum alloy HPDC, due to the excellent in-plant recycling of the alloy and the relatively low emissions from primary aluminum production compared with primary magnesium production. In contrast, for the magnesium alloy, significant reductions in emissions were recorded as the yield increased. This outcome was attributed to the considerable savings achieved in raw material quantities sourced from high-emitting primary production and the use of lower amounts of SF(6), a GHG with a very high global warming potential (GWP). These results were found to hold irrespective of changes to the ratio between the primary and secondary alloys in the raw material mix, although the magnitude of the impact was reduced considerably with reductions in the primary alloy component. In the case of the magnesium alloy HPDC, decreases in quality assurance (QA) rejects and cycle times were also found to contribute toward reduced emissions, although their influences were an order of magnitude lower than that of the yield improvements.",0
"Two questions about climate change remain open: detection and attribution. Detection of change for a complex phenomenon like climate is far from simple, because of the necessary averaging and correcting of the various data sources. Given that change over some period is detected, how do we attribute that change to natural versus anthropogenic causes? Historical data may provide key insights in these critical areas. If historical climate data exhibit regularities such as cycles, then these cycles may be considered to be the ""normal"" behavior of the system, in which case deviations from the ""normal"" pattern would be evidence for anthropogenic effects on climate. This study uses this approach to examine the global warming question. Two 3000-year temperature series with minimal dating error were analyzed. A total of seven time-series models were fit to the two temperature series and to an average of the two series. None of these models used 20th Century data. In all cases, a good to excellent fit was obtained. Of the seven models, six show a warming trend over the 20th Century similar in timing and magnitude to the Northern Hemisphere instrumental series. One of the models passes right through the 20th Century data. These results suggest that 20th Century warming trends are plausibly a continuation of past climate patterns. Results are not precise enough to solve the attribution problem by partitioning warming into natural versus human-induced components. However, anywhere from a major portion to all of the warming of the 20th Century could plausibly result from natural causes according to these results. Six of the models project a cooling trend (in the absence of other forcings) over the next 200 years of 0.2-4degreesC. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Global warming is creating the need to incorporate a considerable amount of knowledge on diversity and functionality into management plans, but this is not always an easy task. We have developed an approach that includes the analysis of biodiversity measures and their relation with physiographic or soil parameters, for use in forestry management plans in Hoyocasero (central Spain). Considering the richness in forest plants and according to their morphological and functional traits, we grouped the species present under the canopy into four groups. Then we have calculated their richness and biodiversity indices and for the set of plants as a whole. The species groups showed differences in richness and diversity indices for the two forest types in the study, while the set of plants as a whole was not sensitive enough to detect variations in the quality of the floristic species. The use of diversity indices applied to particular species groups proved to be a useful method of defining levels of forest quality. This methodology has enabled us to establish that the pinewood is in a better state of conservation than the oakwood. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Like many temperate European lakes, Lake Bourget (France) has suffered from eutrophication during the second half of the last century. Due to a remarkable restoration program, the lake has been recovering for the past 25 years after a massive decrease in total phosphorus (TP) loading. TP concentrations have decreased from about 100-120 to 20-25 mu g/L Additional efforts are, however, still required to obtain a perennially sustainable good ecological status and model parameterisation of fluxes can assist in predicting future outcomes, especially in the context of global warming. In this paper, a dynamic model (MeroLakeMab) was developed and tested with the purpose to reconstruct the loading history of Lake Bourget and to predict TP concentrations during scenarios of increased temperature, decreased water runoff and decreased P loading. Simulations suggested that the historical TP loading decrease may have been as extensive as 88%. Decreases in water discharge to Lake Bourget at magnitudes forecasted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would not affect TP concentrations notably, but marked concentration changes could, however, occur if decreases in runoff would have a strong impact on the TP loading. Increasing temperature effects on yearly mean TP concentrations in the water column would be very small compared to effects from changes in the TP loading. Predictions such as these could be instrumental for future successful lake management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"The environmental assessment of the processing and consumption of mussels of the species Mytilus galloprovincialis was carried out for both fresh and canned mussels. For this purpose, the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was considered. Inventories for mussel purification in dispatch centres and mussel transformation in canning factories were performed, along with those for household consumption of fresh and canned mussels. Environmental characterization results were computed for different impact categories, including abiotic depletion, global warming, ecotoxicity, human toxicity, acidification, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation and eutrophication. As a whole, the environmental hot spots for fresh mussel processing included electricity and chlorine gas production, as well as water discharge in dispatch centres. Similarly, the environmental hot spots for canned mussel processing comprised electricity production, can production and transport, oil production, and fuel oil production. Finally, the implementation of the previous mussel culture stage into the LCA of mussel processing and consumption showed the relevant role of the mussel culture system when assessing the potential environmental impacts of mussel-based products.

"Global climate change may affect the upper elevational limits of distribution of montane organisms, especially if those limits are set directly by temperature. Oviparous (egg-laying) reptiles are constrained in this way because of their nesting requirements. In many areas, deforestation has already subjected these animals to small-scale ""climate change."" Clearing for power lines (hydrocuts) increases solar radiation to potential nest sites, and hence enables these animals to penetrate higher into montane areas than would otherwise be possible. Such small-scale anthropogenic ""warming"" may offer a useful model system to explore consequences of broader climate change on the distribution and biology of montane organisms. We quantified thermal effects of a hydrocut in montane eucalypt forest in the Brindabella Range of southeastern Australia. The reduced canopy cover, increased duration of sunlight exposure, and higher levels of incident radiation in cleared areas substantially modified thermal regimes in potential nest sites. Orientation and exposure were the most important determinants of nest temperature and predicted the distribution of natural nests. Such cleared corridors (for roads, power lines, ski runs, etc.) may not only extend the upper elevational limit for oviparous reptiles, but may also modify the genetic structure and demography of populations.",0
"Little Ice Age (14th-19th centuries A. D.) glacial maxima and 20th century retreat have been well documented in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. However, the influence of regional and Pacific Basin driven climate variability on these events is poorly understood. We use tree-ring reconstructions of North Pacific surface temperature anomalies and summer drought as proxies for winter glacial accumulation and summer ablation, respectively, over the past three centuries. These records show that the 1850's glacial maximum was likely produced by similar to70 yrs of cool/wet summers coupled with high snowpack. Post 1850, glacial retreat coincides with an extended period (>50 yr) of summer drought and low snowpack culminating in the exceptional events of 1917 to 1941 when retreat rates for some glaciers exceeded 100 m/yr. This research highlights potential local and ocean-based drivers of glacial dynamics, and difficulties in separating the effects of global climate change from regional expressions of decadal-scale climate variability.",0
"Indirect land use change for biofuels: Testing predictions and improving analytical methodologies by S. Kim and B. Dale , presents a principal inference not supported by its results, that rests on a fundamental conceptual error, and that has no place in the current discussion of biofuels' climate effects. The paper takes correlation between two variables in a system with many interacting factors to indicate (or contraindicate) causation, and draws a completely incorrect inference from observed sample statistics and their significance levels.

"During the last decade, there has been an intensive debate on-going in Sweden about how power generation and use affect global warming. More precisely, the discussion has considered how electricity shall be assessed from an environmental and climate perspective in different situations. This article gives a critical analysis on the main viewpoints. A number of environmental-impact assessment principles are outlined and critically examined. Concepts like average electricity and marginal electricity are discussed, and Electricity Disclosure as a basis for evaluation is addressed. The impact from Emission Trading and Tradable Green Certificates is also considered. Recommendations to concerned stakeholders are given. The clash points in the Swedish debate are highlighted and thus made available to a broader audience outside Scandinavia. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Ocean temperatures in the upper 250 m in the northern North Pacific (60-degrees-N, 149-degrees-W) increased bt more than 1-degrees-C from 1972 to 1098 but are now decreasing. Subsurface temperature anomalies are well correlated (approximately 0.58) with the air temperature anomalies at Sitka, Alaska; hence the coastal air temperatures can be used as a proxy data set to extend the ocean temperature time series back to 1828. Up to 30% of the low-frequency variance can be accounted for with the 18.6-year nodal signal. Additionally. spectral analysis of these air temperature variations indicates a significant low-frequency peak in the range of the 18.6-year signal. Similar low-frequency signals have been reported for Hudson Bay air temperatures since 1700, for sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic from 1876 to 1939, and for sea level in the high-latitude southern hemisphere. The water column temperature variations presented here are the first evidence that the upper ocean is responding to this very long period tidal forcing. An enhanced high-latitude response to the 18.6-year forcing is predicted by equilibrium tide theory, and it should be most evident at latitudes poleward of about 50-degrees. These low-frequency ocean-atmosphere variations must - be considered in high-latitude assessments of global climate change, since they are of the same magnitude as many of the predicted global changes.",0
"The success of exotic species can be influenced by both the abiotic environment and species interactions. Many studies have demonstrated significant effects of either type of factor on aspects of exotic success, but few have considered their relative effects on population growth rate, a more holistic measure of success. To quantify the relative effects of environment and direct competition on an exotic ascidian, Botrylloides violaceus, I manipulated direct contact interactions at four sites with different abiotic environments and tracked individual colonies over 3 years. I tested site and contact treatment effects on survival, growth and fecundity, and then conducted a life table response experiment on a periodic, size-structured population matrix model to test their effects on population growth rate. Both site and contact interaction were important to explaining variation in survival and growth. Contact interactions decreased the survival and growth of larger colonies but unexpectedly increased the survival of small colonies at some sites, which led to relatively weaker and spatially variable effects on overall population growth rates. Site effects on population growth rates were an order of magnitude larger than contact effects, and site variation in winter vital rates made the largest contributions to changes in population growth rate. The results of this study suggest that the abiotic environment plays a larger role in the success of B. violaceus. Thus, environmental variables, such as temperature and salinity, could be used to predict this exotic species' success under different environmental scenarios, including global climate change.",0
"In a burn of 5-year-old secondary forest cleared for agriculture in Roraima, Brazil, carbon partitioning was measured for above-ground portions of both secondary forest (regrowth) and the remains of original forest, felled and burned six years previously. Above-ground dry weight biomass averaged 43.0 +/- 6.5 Mg (megagrams=metric tons) per hectare (Mg ha(-1)) for secondary forest and 105.8 +/- 23.7 Mg ha(-1) for original forest remains. Pre- and post-burn above-ground biomass loadings were estimated by cutting and weighing six 60-m(2) plots and by line-intersect sampling (LIS) done along the axis of each post-burn plot (three transects), plus two supplementary LIS transects. High variability of initial biomass made LIS more reliable for assessing change in material >10 cm in diameter; quantities for diameter classes <10 cm relied on direct weighing. Above-ground carbon pools were reduced by 67.8% in secondary forest and 32.0% in original forest remains. Burning released 28.8 Mg C ha(-1) (original forest remains plus secondary forest biomass), or 46% of the pre-burn total carbon stock in biomass. The remainder of the carbon either remained as residual biomass (39.2 Mg C ha(-1) or 56.5% of pre-burn C) or as charcoal and ashes (4 Mg C ha(-1) or 2.0%). Carbon stock in charcoal increased from 0.50 Mg C ha(-1) to 07 Mg C ha(-1), a net gain of 0.57 Mg C ha(-1), or 0.8% of the pre-burn above-ground carbon stock. The net gain of charcoal carbon was composed of 0.21 Mg C ha(-1) from secondary forest biomass and 0.36 Mg C ha(-1) from original forest remains; 1% of the above-ground secondary forest carbon was converted to charcoal, while the corresponding percentage for original forest remains was 0.7%. Ashes contained an additional 0.29 Mg C ha(-1), of which 0.11 Mg C ha(-1) can be attributed to secondary forest biomass and 0.18 Mg C ha(-1) to original forest remains. If the carbon in ashes is assumed to be finely powdered charcoal, this stock adds 0.21% to the charcoal formation percentage for secondary forest and 0.36% to that for original forest remains. The overall charcoal-formation percentage was 6%, or 2.0% if ashes are included. Charcoal-formation percentages in this study are lower than those sometimes assumed in global carbon models; nevertheless, charcoal can represent an important sink of atmospheric carbon over long time scales.

"Climate models suggest that global warming could bring warmer, drier conditions to Mexico. Although precipitation increases are projected by some models, in most cases they do not compensate for increases in potential evaporation. Thus, soil moisture and water availability may decrease over much of Mexico with serious consequences for rainfed and irrigated agriculture, urban and industrial water supplies, hydropower and ecosystems. However, the assessment of global warming impacts in Mexico is an uncertain task because the projections of different models vary widely, particularly for precipitation, and because they perform poorly in reproducing the observed climate of Mexico.",0
"The Mesta-Nestos river basin in Bulgaria and Greece is a case study for transboundary decision-making support in south-eastern Europe and a show-case for the development of methodologies and information-gathering for the integrated regional planning of water resources. Land-use conflicts in this water-scarce region cover a wide spectrum of activities like agricultural irrigation, drinking water production, diversions for industrial water, and risk of pollution from mining, to name a few examples. Measurements of the water quality were carried out in the upper basin. Results will be illustrated by the example of the environmental situation in the alpine region of the Pirin National Park as well as in the Razlog Basin with a stronger anthropogenic impact and pollution around a former uranium mine near the village of Elesnica. The social and economic development of this transboundary region is a recently established priority for the future. It will mean an increase in water usage and more stress for the water resources if regional impacts of global climate change are verified. Problem-focused management of the catchment area as a whole on the basis of proved geo-data sets is needed for the future.",0
"Global warming is likely to increase spring temperatures in regions with a cool climate. To examine the effects of this change on rice productivity, we exposed rice plants to a higher (by +2.7 to +2.8 degrees C) water temperature (T(w)) during the vegetative growth period (for 35-50 days) under three levels of N fertilization. High T(w) during vegetative growth made the heading stage occur 4-7 days earlier for all levels of N fertilization in both years. The crop growth rate during the treatment period was greatly enhanced by high T(w): by 51-82% in 2008 and by 49-62% in 2009. There was no T(w) x N fertilizer interaction. This increased growth was associated with increased leaf expansion and increased canopy radiation capture rather than with increased radiation-use efficiency. However, the positive effect decreased during subsequent growth stages under all levels of N fertilization, leading to no significant differences in total biomass at maturity. High T(w) during vegetative growth greatly reduced SPAD values during the grain-filling stage compared with SPAD values in the control T(w) treatment, for all levels of N fertilization, and decreased leaf photosynthesis during the mid-grain filling stage. Grain yield was not significantly affected by high T(w) at any N fertilizer level or in either year. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"The surface emission of landfill gas (LFG) was studied to estimate the amount of LFG efflux from solid waste landfills using an air flux chamber. LFG efflux increased as atmospheric temperature increased during the day, and the same pattern for the surface emission was observed for the change of seasons. LFG efflux rate decreased from summer through winter. The average LFG efflux rates of winter, spring and summer were 0.1584, 0.3013 and 0.8597 m(3) m(-2) h(-1) respectively. The total amount of surface emission was calculated based on the seasonal LFG efflux rate and the landfill surface area. From the estimates of LFG generation, it is expected that about 30% of the generated LFG may be released through the surface without extraction process. As forced extraction with a blower proceeded, the extraction well pressure decreased from 1100 to -100 mm H2O, and the LFG surface efflux decreased markedly above 80%. Thus, the utilization of LFG by forced extraction would be the good solution for global warming and air pollution by LFG. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Global warming and its effect on local climate conditions is one of the presumed underlying causes for changes in temporal and spatial distribution of vector-borne diseases. In Europe, canine babesiosis is transmitted by Dermacentor reticulatus. This hard tick species is observed to spread to new endemic areas. Within these new areas, specific local climate conditions may be responsible for sudden seasonal onset and termination of occurrence of this disease in dogs. From 2000 to 2006, 343 confirmed cases of canine babesiosis were documented at the Veterinary University of Vienna and in the Laboratory for Veterinary Diagnostic (INVITRO, Vienna). Estimated week of infection was analysed for mean air and soil temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation for each case. For seasonal start in spring, a sudden rise of air temperature Lip to 12 degrees C and defrosting of soil were essential. In autumn, the seasonal start was associated with a drop of temperature below 17 degrees C. Termination of occurrence of canine babesiosis, independent of season, correlated either with a sudden drop of temperature (Delta T> 9 degrees C) with concurrent heavy rain, persistent drought, or with air temperature above 20 degrees C (spring/summer) or below 5 degrees C (autumn/winter). Relative humidity and precipitation did not have a major influence on the incidence of canine babesiosis at all. Global climate changes and adaptation of ticks to new environmental conditions introduce vector-borne diseases into new areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",0
"There exist five primary periods of 2 930, 1 140, 490, 250 and 220 a in the Holocene climatic variations in the Huguangyan Maar Lake, according to the energy-spectrum and filter analyses of high-resolution time sequences (10-15 a) of the sediment dry density. The peak values of the three temperature-decreasing periods with the 2 930 a cycle occur at about 7 300, 4 250 and 1 200 Gal. aBP. There are 7-8 temperature-decreasing periods with the 1 140 a cycle, and the climate fluctuation range is largest in the early Holocene, and reduces gradually in the middle and late Holocene. The millennial-scale climatic change in the Holocene may adjust the global water cycle and the thermohaline circulation intensity through the harmonic tones of the earth's precession cycle, which in turn influences the global climate change.",0
"May-September temperatures were reconstructed for the past 250 yr based on Dahurian larch Larix gmelinii Rupr. growing in permafrost region of Northeast. China. The reconstruction accounts for 39.3% of the actual temperature variance over the period 1958-2008. The reconstruction captured 3 relatively cold periods in 1847-1852, 1861-1866 and 1935-1941; 2 relatively warm periods in 1874-1879 and 2001-2008; and a persistent warming trend since the mid-20th century. The long-term changes in temperature documented here correspond well with regional temperature change from observational records, other global and regional proxy-based temperature reconstructions, and documented changes in regional permafrost. Thus, valuable information might be preserved in our reconstruction about local- to regional-scale climatic variation during the past 2.5 centuries.",0
"Gorgonian corals are long-lived, slow-growing species exhibiting slow population dynamics. Demographic data collected over a period of 11 yr on a small population of temperate, canopy-forming gorgonians dwelling near the edge of the summer thermocline in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea enabled us to assess its responses to the large mortality events that occurred in 1999 and 2003. Changes in population density, size structure and recruitment were examined. Overall, 2101 adult colonies and recruits were observed in situ and 240 photographic plots analyzed. During the first 3 years (2004 to 2006) after the mass mortalities, our measurements revealed a dramatic reduction in the density of healthy colonies (90% suffered total or partial mortality), a shift in the dominant size class towards smaller size and a significant reduction in recruitment. In the following years (2007 to 2008) a significant recovery of injured colonies was found, with almost complete detachment of the dead colonies, a reduction in mortality and a 4-fold increase in recruitment. These findings indicate clear-cut restoration trends of the population, suggesting that recovery after extensive mortality could be faster than predicted by our current knowledge of gorgonian population dynamics.",0
"The microscopic fungus Cephalosporium maydis Samra, Sabet and Hingorani, which causes late wilt disease in maize, has been isolated for the first time in Hungary. According to the literature the pathogen is only known at present to cause economic damage in Egypt and India The fungus is seedborne, so it can be assumed that it reached Hungary through the import of infected propagation stock It causes a disease of the vascular bundles, the first symptoms of which can be observed in maize at tasselling. Diseased plants have retarded development, then wilt and finally. dry up. The vascular bundles become discoloured and cavities are formed in the pith. It is highly probable that global warming and the dry weather experienced in early summer over the last decade or so have played a decisive role in the appearance and activity of the pathogen in Hungary. If the climate continues to warm up, the significance of this disease could increase under Hungarian conditions, so it is important to carry out further studies both on the pathogen itself and on the resistance of cultivated hybrids and lines, and to elaborate effective methods of chemical control.",0
"Global climate change may have large impacts on water supplies, drought or flood frequencies and magnitudes in local and regional hydrologic systems. Water authorities therefore rely on computer models for quantitative impact prediction. In this study we present kernel-based learning machine river flow models for the Upper Gallego catchment of the Ebro basin. Different learning machines were calibrated using daily gauge data. The models posed two major challenges: (1) estimation of the rainfall-runoff transfer function from the available time series is complicated by anthropogenic regulation and mountainous terrain and (2) the river flow model is weak when only climate data are used, but additional antecedent flow data seemed to lead to delayed peak How estimation. These types of models, together with the presented downscaled climate scenarios, can be used for climate change impact assessment in the Gallego, which is important for the future management of the system.

Climate-based estimates of the fitness of the main structural elements of several western Mediterranean plant communities were used to estimate potential community integrity and its consequent vulnerability under a global-change scenario involving warming but no net drying. Results for a simple Quercus ilex community suggest expansion northward and inland under warming but with significant loss of area currently covered by the community. The data for estimating such changes in potential community integrity and areal coverage can be readily obtained from climatic envelope models. Mapping can be done by interpolation or by pixel-based GIS methods.,0
"The mid-Holocene (ca. 8000-4000 cal yr BP) was a time of marked aridity throughout much of Minnesota, and the changes due to mid-Holocene aridity are seen as an analog for future responses to global warming. In this study, we compare the transition into (ca. 9000-7000 yr ago) and out of (ca. 5000-2500 yr ago) the mid-Holocene (MH) period at Kimble Pond and Sharkey Lake, located along the prairie forest ecotone in south-central Minnesota, using high resolution (similar to 5-36yr) sampling of pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetic and loss-on-ignition properties. Changes in vegetation were asymmetrical with increasing aridity being marked by a pronounced shift from woodland/forest-dominated landscape to a more open mix of grassland and woodland/savanna. In contrast, at the end of the MH, grassland remained an important component of the landscape despite increasing effective moisture, and high charcoal influxes (median 2.7-4.0 vs. 0.6-7mm(2) cm(-2) yr(-1) at start of MH) suggest the role of fire in limiting woodland expansion. Asymmetric vegetation responses, variation among and within proxies, and the near-absence of fire today suggest caution in using changes associated with mid-Holocene aridity at the prairie forest boundary as an analog for future responses to global warming.

"Mexico is vulnerable to the influence of tropical cyclones that develop in the Pacific Northeast and North Atlantic Oceans. During the last years, the destructive force of some of them has led to the idea that their frequency or/and intensity tend to increase due to the global climate change. A greater number of topical cyclones are formed in the Pacific Ocean; however, oceanic and atmospheric circulation displaces them away from the Mexican coasts. That is no the case for the tropical cyclones from the Atlantic Ocean. The analysis over a period of more than 50 years shows that there is no clear increase tendency of those meteors, and that the Mexican states with greater impact from tropical cyclones at the Pacific coast are Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, while for the Atlantic coast they are Tamaulipas and Quintana Roo.",0
"Panmictic species pose particular problems for conservation because their welfare can be addressed effectively only on a global scale. We recently documented by means of microsatellite analysis that the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is not panmictic but instead shows genetic isolation by distance. In this study, we extended the analysis to the American eel (A. rostrata) by applying identical analytical procedures and statistical power. Results obtained for the American eel were in sharp contrast with those obtained for the European eel: the null hypothesis of panmixia could not be rejected, and no isolation by distance was detected. This implies that the species must be managed as a single population. Using Bayesian statistics, we also found that the effective population sizes for both species were surprisingly low and that the populations had undergone severe contractions, most probably during the Wisconsinan glaciation. The apparent sensitivity of eels to climatic changes affecting the strength and position of the Gulf Stream 20 000 years ago is particularly worrying, given the effects of the ongoing global warming on the North Atlantic climate. Moreover, additional short-term stresses such as surging glass eel prizes, overfishing and lethal parasitic infections negatively affect eel population size. The fascinating transatlantic migration and life cycle of Atlantic eels is also their Achilles' heel as these negative short- and long-term effects will probably culminate in a fatal synergy if drastic conservation measures are not implemented to protect these international biological resources.",0
"The National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) consecutively sponsored the Ocean-Systems for Chemical, Optical, and Physical Experiments (O-SCOPE) and Multi-disciplinary Ocean Sensors for Environmental Analyses and Networks (MOSEAN) projects from 1998 through 2008. The O-SCOPE and MOSEAN projects focused on developing and testing new sensors and systems for autonomous, concurrent measurements of biological, chemical, optical, and physical variables from a diverse suite of stationary and mobile ocean platforms. Design considerations encompassed extended open-ocean and coastal deployments, instrument durability, biofouling mitigation, data accuracy and precision, near-real-time data telemetry, and economy-the latter being critical for widespread sensor and system utilization. The complementary O-SCOPE and MOSEAN projects increased ocean sensing and data telemetry capabilities for addressing many societally relevant problems such as global climate change, ocean carbon cycling and sequestration, acidification, eutrophication, anoxia, and ecosystem dynamics, including harmful algal blooms. NOPP support enabled O-SCOPE and MOSEAN to accelerate progress in achieving multiscale, multidisciplinary, sustained observations of the ocean environment. Importantly, both programs produced value-added scientific results, which demonstrated the utility of these new technologies. The NOPP framework fostered strong collaborations among academic, commercial, and government entities, and facilitated technology transfers to the general research community and to long-term observational and observatory programs.",0
"Coastal California has witnessed persistent sea-level rise (10-20 cm) along its southern and central open ocean coastal sections and in San Francisco Bay over the past century. This paper aims to understand the perceptions of local coastal managers in California of current inundation-related risks, the added risks from climate change, and vulnerability to the growing coastal problems. We also explore the extent to which coastal managers are beginning to think about and tackle these increasing management challenges. Survey results presented here suggest that inundation already creates critical management challenges in California, but other, non-inundation-related coastal problems also vie for managers' attention. Despite high awareness of global warming and moderately good understanding of potential impact so climate change on coastal areas, currently pressing issues and limited staff time and resources constrain their ability to begin dealing with the growing risks from sea-level rise. The sobering conclusion is that California is inadequately preparing for the impacts of climate change on coastal areas at this time. Local government will need substantial support from state and federal agencies if the level of preparedness for climate change and other inundation-related risks is to be elevated in the future.",0
"The degree to which coral reef ecosystems will be impacted by global climate change depends on regional and local differences in corals' susceptibility and resilience to environmental stressors. Here, we present data from a reciprocal transplant experiment using the common reef building coral Porites lobata between a highly fluctuating back reef environment that reaches stressful daily extremes, and a more stable, neighbouring forereef. Protein biomarker analyses assessing physiological contributions to stress resistance showed evidence for both fixed and environmental influence on biomarker response. Fixed influences were strongest for ubiquitin-conjugated proteins with consistently higher levels found in back reef source colonies both pre and post-transplant when compared with their forereef conspecifics. Additionally, genetic comparisons of back reef and forereef populations revealed significant population structure of both the nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial genomes of the coral host (F(ST) = 0.146 P < 0.0001, F(ST) = 0.335 P < 0.0001 for rDNA and mtDNA, respectively), whereas algal endosymbiont populations were genetically indistinguishable between the two sites. We propose that the genotype of the coral host may drive limitations to the physiological responses of these corals when faced with new environmental conditions. This result is important in understanding genotypic and environmental interactions in the coral algal symbiosis and how corals may respond to future environmental changes.",0
"Responsiveness of Lepidoptera phenology to climate has been detected in a number of species during the current trend in global warming. There is still a question of whether climate signals would be evident in historical data. In this paper we examine the climatic response of 155 species of moths and butterflies collected during the period 1866-1884 in Wiltshire, southern England. In general, species responded to increased temperature in the previous October by delayed appearance and to increased temperature in the current spring by advanced appearance. Thus, differential changes in temperatures of the autumn and spring could well affect changes in the relative pattern of the phenology of species. Attributes influencing the species' ecology were examined to see if they influenced temperature responsiveness. In general, few consistent effects emerged, though responsiveness to climate was found to be greater for species eclosing later in the year, specifically to the previous autumn temperatures.. and to hibernal environment, increasingly for species less exposed to air temperatures. These findings warn against expecting simple responses to climate warming.",0
"In grassland ecosystems, most of the carbon (C) occurs below-ground. Understanding changes in soil fluxes induced by elevated atmospheric CO2 is critical for balancing the global C budget and for managing grassland ecosystems sustainably. In this review, we use the results of short-term (1-2 years) studies of below-ground processes in grassland communities under elevated CO2 to assess future prospects for longer-term increases in soil C storage. Results are broadly consistent with those from other plant communities and include: increases in below-ground net primary productivity and an increase in soil C cycling rate, changes in soil faunal community, and generally no increase in soil C storage. Based on other experimental data, future C storage could be favoured in soils of moderate nutrient status, moderate-to-high clay content, and low (or moderately high) soil moisture status. Some support for these suggestions is provided by preliminary results from direct measurements of soil C concentrations near a New Zealand natural CO2-venting spring, and by simulations of future changes in grassland soils under the combined effects of CO2 fertilization and regional climate change. Early detection of any increase in soil C storage appears unlikely in complex grassland communities because of (a) the difficulty of separating an elevated CO2 effect from the effects of soil factors including moisture status, (b) the high spatial variability of soil C and (c) the effects of global warming. Several research imperatives are identified for reducing the uncertainties in the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil C.",0
"Unprecedented cold water was observed off the east coast of Korea in the summer of 2007, with the lowest temperature since 196 The 9-year QuikSCAT satellite scatterometer wind field showed that the spectacular coastal upwelling was induced by Ekman transport to the offshore area by strong southerly winds. These characteristic winds were produced by the large scale air pressure distribution of typhoon Pabuk to the west, which stayed longest for the past half century, along with the North Pacific High (NPH) in the east. The duration of both tropical depressions and the westward moving NPH have shown characteristic increasing trends over several decades, which facilitate favorable conditions for the surface cooling. The negative trend in coastal water temperatures, in contrast with a positive trend offshore by global warming, supports the conclusion that small scale sea surface temperature variations at the coastal area could be remotely affected by long-term large-scale variations.

"Radiative forcing, the global warming potential, and the recently proposed global temperature potential are widely used not only in scientific studies but also in a number of economic and political evaluations of the effects of an increase in the contents of greenhouse gases and aerosols and other factors that form climate and its changes. New indices have appeared, and, to calculate them, information is required on the quantitative characteristics of the climate system's components-current and expected-within standard periods of 20, 100, and 500 years. The calculations of some of these indices and potentials require consideration for variations in the rate of energy exchange between the atmosphere and the underlying surface (ocean) within the indicated periods. This leads to a more general problem of analyzing the sensitivity of the climate system to external (radiative) forcing and its response to such a forcing for the conditions of both stationary (equilibrium) and nonstationary ""greenhouse"" climates. A brief review of the few existing studies of such a response is given.",0
"The challenges of how to respond to climate change and ensure sustainable development are currently high on the political agenda among the world's leading nations. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is part of the global carbon market developing rapidly as part of the Kyoto response towards the mitigation of global warming. One of the aims of the CDM is to achieve sustainable development in developing countries, but uncertainty prevails as to whether the CDM is doing what it promises to do. Close to 200 studies on the CDM have been carried out since its birth in 1997 including peer-reviewed articles and reports from the grey literature. This review of the literature serves to assess the state of knowledge on how the CDM contributes to sustainable development (SD) including poverty alleviation. The main finding of the review is that, left to market forces, the CDM does not significantly contribute to sustainable development.",0
"An unprecedented mass mortality event has been observed at the end of the summer 1999 along the coasts of Provence (France) and Ligury (Italy). This event has severely affected a wide array of sessile filter-feeder invertebrates from hard-substratum communities, such as sponges (particularly the keratose sponges Hipposongia and Spongia), cnidarians (particularly the anthozoans Corallium, Paramuricea, Eunicella and Cladocora), bivalves, ascidians and bryozoans. Along the Provence coasts, the outbreak spread from east to west. Exceptionally high and constant temperatures of the whole water column (23-24 degreesC, for over one month, down to 40 m) could have determined an environmental context favourable to the mass mortality event. Like the thermal anomaly, the mortality is limited in depth. However, rye cannot ascertain whether temperature had a direct effect on organisms or acted in synergy with a latent and/or waterborne agent (microbiological or chemical). Taking into account the global warming context in the NW-Mediterranean, monitoring programs of physical-chemical parameters and vulnerable populations should rapidly be set up.

"Methane emissions associated with coal-mine ventilation pose a tremendous environmental problem and lead to inadvertent loss of a valuable energy source. The proportion of methane released through underground ventilation is as high as 70% of all the coal-related emissions. Additionally, the CH(4) Global Warming Potential is 21 (for a timescale of 100 years), compared with 1 for carbon dioxide. If the heat of combustion of the methane could be usefully employed, this would bring a twofold benefit of avoiding both CH(4) release and CO(2) emission from the production and use of the fuel thereby displaced. The projects carried out in the Institute of Chemical Engineering, Polish Academy of Sciences explored three major routes for utilizing ventilation air methane (VAM): (1) using VAM as combustion air in conventional boilers, (2) oxidizing VAM in reverse-flow reactors (either catalytic or non-catalytic) to produce heat, (3) enriching VAM (via pressure-swing adsorption or membrane separation) to concentration levels suitable for subsequent use (in, say, reverse-flow reactors). The investigations have now been focused upon homogeneous combustion of VAM in reverse-flow reactors. (C) 2008 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"The Donana peridunal lagoons, located in the southwest of Spain, have been well studied, because their conservation is of great interest. Since 1965, they have also been affected by the extraction of underground water for local coastal tourist resorts. A reconstruction of the evolution of this series of coastal lagoons reveals that, along with the anthropogenic effect, there was a natural effect resulting from the reactivation of mobile dune fronts that have blocked and filled the original lagoon complex-in the period 1920-1987, the lagoons were reduced by 70.7%. These fronts might have been fed by deposits of marine sand during the climatically driest phases of the Little Ice Age in Andalusia, Spain. Therefore, if the frequency and duration of dry periods increase, as well as droughts as a whole, because of global warming, the desiccation and disappearance of the lagoons could become more widespread, not only at this site in southwestern Europe, but in other Mediterranean coastal ecosystems as well.",0
"Recent studies have shown that, in response to global climate change, diverse avian taxa are now nesting measurably earlier (< 10 days) in both the United States and Britain. Similarly, several studies on European birds have now demonstrated that a variety of species (although not all) are arriving increasingly early. However, surprisingly, widespread changes in North American migrant phenology have not been demonstrated. It is hypothesized that short-distance migrants (birds that winter in the southern United States) may be quicker to adapt to climate change than long-distance migrants (birds that winter south of the United States), as short-distance migrants can respond to meteorological cues indicating weather conditions to the north whereas long-distance migrants must rely on photoperiod. This study examined the first arrival dates of 103 migrant birds in New York and Massachusetts and found that, on average, all migrants arrived significantly earlier during the period 1951-1993 than the period 1903-1950. From 1951-1993 birds wintering in the southern United States arrived on average 13 days earlier while birds wintering in South America arrived 4 days earlier. Although a change in observer effort cannot be quantified and may be a source of bias, a comparison of the numbers of reporting observers during the 1930s and the 1980s revealed no significant difference. These results are consistent with those expected under a scenario of global warming.",0
"Significantly increasing temperature since the 1980s in China has become a consensus under the background of global climate change and how climate change affects agriculture or even cropping systems has attracted more and more attention from Chinese government and scientists. In this study, the possible effects of climate warming on the national northern, limits of cropping systems, the northern limits of winter wheat and double rice, and the stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation in China from 1981 to 2007 were analyzed. Also, the possible change of crop yield caused by planting limits displacement during the periods 1950s-1981 and 1981-2007 was compared and discussed. The recognized calculation methods of agricultural climatic indices were employed. According to the indices of climatic regionalization for cropping systems, the national northern limits of cropping systems, winter wheat and double rice, and the stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation during two periods, including the 1950s-1980 and 1981-2007, were drawn with ArcGIS software. Compared with the situation during the 1950s-1980, the northern limits of double cropping system during 1981-2007 showed significant spatial displacement in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces and Beijing municipality, China. The northern limits of triple cropping system showed the maximum spatial displacement in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, China. Without considering variety change and social economic factors, the per unit area grain yield of main planting patterns would increase about 54-106% if single cropping system was replaced by double cropping system, which turned out to be 27-58% if double cropping system was replaced by triple cropping system. In Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia autonomous regions, China, the northern limits of winter wheat during 1981-2007 moved northward and expanded westward in different degrees, compared with those during the 1950s-1980. Taking Hebei Province as an example, the northern limits of winter wheat moved northward, and the per unit area grain yield would averagely increase about 25% in the change region if the spring wheat was replaced by winter wheat. In Zhejiang, Anhui. Hubei, and Hunan provinces, China, the planting northern limits of double rice moved northward, and the per unit area grain yield would increase in different degrees only from the perspective of heat resource. The stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation moved southeastward in most regions, which was caused by the de crease of local precipitation in recent years. During the past 50 yr, climate warming made the national northern limits of cropping systems move northward in different degrees, the northern limits of winter wheat and double rice both moved northward, and the cropping system change would cause the increase of per unit area grain yield in the change region. However, the stable-yield northern limits of rainfed winter wheat-summer maize rotation moved southeastward due to the decrease of precipitation.",0
"The anthropogenic effects of global climate change on water resources may be masked by natural climate variability. With a warmer climate, drought and excess rainfall conditions could become more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting. The potential increase in these natural hazards is of concern, given the stresses they place on water resources and agricultural production, and the high costs that result from these hazards. For these reasons, long-term studies were conducted in Eastern Hungary from 1962-2001 in order to obtain the relationship between rainfall quantities, soil agrochemical properties, and mineral fertilization on yields of rye, potato, winter wheat and triticale. Averaged rainfall quantities over many years, experimental years, and phenological phases over many years and experimental years for rye were 567 mm, 497 turn, 509 mm and 452 mm; for potato 551 mm, 537 mm, 337 mm and 294 mm; for winter wheat 586 mm, 509 mm, 518 mm and 467 mm; for triticale 551 mm, 537 mm, 489 mm and 497 turn respectively. Rainfall deviations (+/-) from the average over many years in the experimental years and during the phenological phases for rye were -12 % and -11 %; for potato -3 % and -13 %; for winter wheat -13 % and -10 %; and for triticale -3 % and 2 %. During the vegetation period, the relationships between rainfall quantity, nutrition (N, P, K, Ca, Mg), and yield were characterized by polynomial correlations ""R"" (rye: 0.65-0.99, potato: 0.95-0.98, winter wheat: 0.54-0.76, triticale: 0.28-0.67). Maximum yields of 4.0 t ha(-1) for rye, 20 t ha(-1) for potato, 3.4 t ha(-1) for winter wheat, and 5.5 t ha(-1) for triticale were observed when the respective natural rainfall amount was in the range of 430-500, 280-330, 449-495 and 550-600 mm. At rainfall amounts above and below these ranges, crop yields are drastically reduced.",0
"Ornithological report 2001-2006 for the Camargue. The present ornithological report for the Camargue covers six years (2001-2006). This time-period has been marked by an accelerated global warming (the summer 2003 was particularly extreme). Owing to a constant high observation pressure, 18 new species have been recorded and many rare species have been resighted in that region (Camargue, Crau, Alpilles). Among the species or group of species which are regularly censused, the number of breeding Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus roseus and that of wintering ducks and coots did not show any significant change. The colonial herons have continued either to increase or to fluctuate at a high level. For example, the Great White Egret Casmerodius albus has definitely settled in the delta and the Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides has reached a new peak of 505 pairs in 2006. More efficient prospection efforts gave more precise breeding numbers for two species of solitary herons, the Great Bittern Botaurus stellaris and the Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus. New breeding species such as the Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, White Stork Ciconia ciconia, Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia and Greylag Anser anser increased their numbers as well as the Glossy Ibis Plegadis falcinellus of which 14 pairs has bred in 2006 and the Purple Swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio which was found for the first time breeding in 2006. The breeding species showing the most serious concern are actually the breeding gulls and terns whose figures have dramatically decreased. Without human management, this situation will even become worse in a near future. Further remarkable observations were the first case of wintering Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina in 2001/2002, a mixed pair of Black-winged Pratincole Glareola nordmanni x Collared Pratincole G. pratincola in 2001, the settling of the Rook Corvus frugilegus in Arles.",0
"In an attempt to evaluate the potential of petroleum bioremediation at high latitudes environments, microcosm studies using Antarctic coastal seawater contaminated with diesel or crude oil were conducted in Kerguelen Archipelago (49A degrees 22'S, 70A degrees 12'E). Microcosms were incubated at three different temperatures (4, 10 and 20A degrees C). During experiments, changes observed in microbial assemblages (total direct count, heterotrophic cultivable microorganisms and hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms) were generally similar for all incubation temperatures, but chemical data showed only some slight changes in biodegradation indices [I (C12-C20) pound/I (C21-C32) pound and C17/pristane]. The complete data set provided strong evidence of the presence of indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in Antarctic seawater and their high potential for hydrocarbon bioremediation. The rate of oil degradation could be increased by the addition of a commercial fertilizer, but water temperature had little effects on biodegradation efficiency which is in conflict with the typical temperature-related assumption predicting 50% rate reduction when temperature is reduced by 10A degrees C. Global warming of Antarctic seawater should not increase significantly the rate of oil biodegradation in these remote regions.",0
"Since 1989 we have monitored small mammal populations at a semiarid site in north-central Chile with a large-scale livetrapping grid complex. Selective exclusions of vertebrate predators or putative small mammal competitors, or both, have yielded relatively small or mostly transitory effects, or both, on small mammal population dynamics and plant community composition. During the study period 5 El Nino-high rainfall episodes have occurred lasting 1-3 years. Resident or core small mammals such as Abrothrix olivaceus, Phyllotis darwini, and Octodon degus experience dramatic fluctuations during and following rainfall pulses. Temporary resident or opportunistic species such as Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and A. longipilis disappear from the thorn scrub for varying periods of time. All species persist in more mesic nearby habitats near dry stream courses (aguadas). Since a 3-year high rainfall event in 2000-2002 mean annual rainfall has increased in this region, mainly due to a lack of prolonged droughts. Under these conditions, and building on a qualitative model proposed by Noy-Meir, long-lived species might become more abundant. Changes in the small mammal assemblage are consistent with these predictions; O. degus, a caviomorph rodent with a long life span, now comprises a more constant proportion of the small mammal biomass in the thorn scrub, and we have documented reduced variation in species diversity. Increased rainfall, a predicted consequence of global climate change in this region, might be leading to changes in small mammal assemblage structure and composition and ultimately will result in a more stable, less oscillatory assemblage in the thorn scrub. Additionally, invasive groups such as introduced lagomorphs and ephemeral plants might become more abundant in this community. The long-term consequences of changes in rainfall patterns due to El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSOs), with important teleconnections to global-scale phenomena, will lead to diverse changes at the community level here.",0
"Fuel cells will undoubtedly find widespread use in this new millennium in the conversion of chemical to electrical energy, as they offer very high efficiencies and have unique scalability in electricity-generation applications. The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most exciting of these energy technologies; it is an all-ceramic device that operates at temperatures in the range 500-1,000degreesC. The SOFC offers certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably its ability to use carbon monoxide as a fuel rather than being poisoned by it, and the availability of high-grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power, or combined cycle gas-turbine applications. Although cost is clearly the most important barrier to widespread SOFC implementation, perhaps the most important technical barriers currently being addressed relate to the electrodes, particularly the fuel electrode or anode. In terms of mitigating global warming, the ability of the SOFC to use commonly available fuels at high efficiency, promises an effective and early reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and hence is one of the lead new technologies for improving the environment. Here, we discuss recent developments of SOFC fuel electrodes that will enable the better use of readily available fuels.",0
"The plasma etching Of SiO2 has been investigated in perfluorobutadiene-oxygen containing plasmas using a homemade dual frequency reactor. The process has been characterized by evaluating SiO2 etch rate, SiO2-to-Si selectivity, the surface contamination of Si, and the atmospheric emission of greenhouse gases. The plasma phase has been studied by means of optical emission spectroscopy. Perfluorobutadiene appears to be promising for replacing conventional high global warming potential reactants in SiO2 dry etching. (C) 2003 American Vacuum Society.",0
The current strategy of global warming control is discussed. The advantages and drawbacks of this strategy are analyzed. The conclusion is made that a reduction in the industrial emission of carbon dioxide is not enough to stop temperature growth on our planet.,0
"The increasing demands upon groundwater resources due to expanding metropolitan and agricultural areas are a serious challenge, particularly in semiarid and arid regions. In Iran, decades of unrestrained groundwater extraction for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use have resulted in a precipitous depletion of this valuable resource. Here we show that the decline in groundwater levels is associated with land-surface deformation on local and regional scales. Combining water-level data with satellite radar observations provides evidence for the prevalence of compacting aquifers in the country. Groundwater level decline is often associated with destruction of the aquifers, which appears to be a common problem in the groundwater basins of central and northeast Iran. Global warming and future climate change will affect arid and semiarid areas in the coming decades, further augmenting hazards associated with groundwater-induced land subsidence.",0
"At present, most turtles, all crocodilians, and several lizards are known to have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Due to the dependence of sex determination on incubation temperature, the long-term survival of TSD species may be jeopardized by global climate changes. The current study was designed to assess the degree to which this concern is justified by examining nest-site selection in two species of Pattern II TSD geckos (Eublepharis macularius and Hemitheconyx caudicinctus) and comparing these preferences with those of a species with genotypic sex determination (GSD) (Coleonyx mitratus). Temperature preferences for nest sites were found to be both species-specific and female-specific. While H. caudicinctus females selected a mean nest-site temperature (32.4 degrees) very close to the upper pivotal temperature (32 degrees C) for the species, E. macularius females selected a mean nest-site temperature (28.7 degrees C) well below this species' lower pivotal temperature (30.5 degrees C). Thus, the resultant sex ratios are expected to differ between these two TSD species. Additionally, nest-site temperatures for the GSD species were significantly more variable (SE = +/-0.37) than were temperatures for either of the TSD species (E. macularius SE = +/- 0.10; H. caudicinctus SE = +/-0.17), thereby further demonstrating temperature preferences within the TSD species.

"Many high-density discharges used in microelectronics fabrication use fluorocarbon gases with coincidentally high global-warming potentials (GWPs). We have determined the identities, fluxes, and energy distributions of ions produced in high-density discharges generated in two low GWP gases, CF3I and CF3CH2F (HFC-134a), which have attracted interest for plasma processing applications. Measurements were made using a combined ion energy analyser-mass spectrometer that samples ions through an orifice in the lower electrode of an inductively coupled Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) rf reference cell. The effects of plasma operating conditions and Ar dilution on ion fluxes and energies were examined. Nearly complete dissociation of CF3I occurs in CF3I discharges and I+ comprises almost all of the ion yield. Mean ion energies range from 5 eV to 10 eV for the operating conditions investigated. Discharges generated in mixtures of CF3I with Ar have ion fluxes and energies resembling those in pure CF3I discharges. Pure HFC-134a discharges produce several ions of significant intensity, with HF+ and Si+ bring the most abundant. Mean ion energies range from 20 eV to 35 eV, and decrease as HFC-134a is diluted with Ar. Higher discharge powers result in greater dissociation in HFC-134a discharges, shifting the ion composition towards higher fluxes of lighter ions.",0
"The rate constants for the reactions of OH radicals with the fluorinated ethers, CHF2-O-CHF2 (HFOC-134) and CF3CH2-O-CH2CF3 (HFOC-356mff), were measured using the flash photolysis resonance fluorescence technique over the temperature range 277-370 K to give the following Arrhenius expressions: k(HFOC-134)(T) = (0.63(-0.16)(+0.20)) x 10(-12) exp{-(1646 +/- 76)/T} cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), k(HFOC-356mff)(T) (2.32(-0.41)(+0.46)) x 10(-12): exp{-(790 +/- 47)/T} cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). On the basis of the analysis of the available experimental results, the following Arrhenius expression can be recommended for the rate constant of the reaction between OH and HFOC-134: k(HFOC-134)(T) = (0.82(-0.24)(+0.34)) x 10(-12) exp{-(1730 +/- 110)/T} cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). Atmospheric lifetimes were estimated to be 24.8 years for HFOC-134 (23.8 years based on the results of this study alone) and 0.3 years for HFOC-356mff. Infrared absorption cross sections of HFOC-134, HFOC-356mff,and HFOC-125 (CHF2-O-CF3) were measured at T = 295 K from 500 to 1600 cm(-1) and the global warming potentials of the three compounds were estimated. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of the ethers were measured between 160 and 220 Mm. The general pattern of reactivity of hydrofluoroethers toward OH is discussed.",0
"The inhibition of a newly cloned coral carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1) has been investigated with a series of sulfonamides, including some clinically used derivatives (acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, dichlorophenamide, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, benzolamide, and sulpiride, or indisulam, a compound in clinical development as antitumor drug), as well as the sulfamate antiepileptic topiramate. Some simple amino-/hydrazine-/hydroxy-substituted aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides have also been included in the study. All types of activity have been detected, with low potency inhibitors (K(I)s in the range of 163-770 nM), or with medium potency inhibitors (K(I)s in the range of 75.1-105 nM), whereas ethoxzolamide, several clinically used sulfonamides and heterocyclic compounds showed stronger potency, with KIs in the range of 16-48.2 nM. These inhibitors may be useful to better understand the physiological role of the Stylophora pistillata CA (STPCA) in corals and its involvement in biomineralisation in this era of global warming.

"Northern forest trees are challenged to adapt to changing climate, including global warming and increasing tropospheric ozone (O(3)) concentrations. Both elevated O(3) and temperature can cause significant changes in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions as well as in leaf anatomy that can be related to adaptation or increased stress tolerance, or are signs of damage. Impacts of moderately elevated O(3) (3 x ambient) and temperature (ambient + 1 degrees C), alone and in combination, on VOC emissions and leaf structure of two genotypes (2.2 and 5.2) of European aspen (Populus tremula L.) were studied in an open-field experiment in summer 2007. The impact of O(3) on measured variables was minor, but elevated temperature significantly increased emissions of total monoterpenes and green leaf volatiles. Genotypic differences in the responses to warming treatment were also observed. a-Pinene emission, which has been suggested to protect plants from elevated temperature, increased from genotype 5.2 only. Isoprene emission from genotype 2.2 decreased, whereas genotype 5.2 was able to retain high isoprene emission level also under elevated temperature. Elevated temperature also caused formation of thinner leaves, which was related to thinning of epidermis, palisade and spongy layers as well as reduced area of palisade cells. We consider aspen genotype 5.2 to have better potential for adaptation to increasing temperature because of thicker photosynthetic active palisade layer and higher isoprene and a-pinene emission levels compared to genotype 2.2. Our results show that even a moderate elevation in temperature is efficient enough to cause notable changes in VOC emissions and leaf structure of these aspen genotypes, possibly indicating the effort of the saplings to adapt to changing climate.",0
"Accelerated erosion and transport of fine sediment from upland temperate catchments can reflect increased erosivity and/or erodibility, due in turn to climatic and/or human forcing. Identification of sediment fluxes and sources over Holocene timescales can both enable understanding of the relative impacts of these forcings and provide perspective on recent sediment fluxes. Here we present a similar to 5500 yr record of sediment fluxes and sources from Lake Bassenthwaite in the English Lake District, utilizing magnetic measurements and fuzzy clustering, coupled with independent pollen and archaeological records, to identify the timing and impact of catchment disturbance. This record shows that recent sediment flux increases (ie, within the last 150 years) are unprecedented in scale throughout the mid-late Holocene and appear to be in response to specific human changes occurring within the catchment. Earlier episodes of human activity, from the mid Holocene onwards, show no link with increased lake sediment fluxes, indicating either limited catchment impact and/or 'buffering' through within-catchment sediment storage. Increasingly intensive land use and reduction of sediment storage through revetment construction on a key inflow, Newlands Beck, have resulted in a x increases in lake sediment flux. These data may be significant for other upland temperate areas, as increasing land-use pressures and reduced sediment storage capacity may not only increase contemporary sediment flux, but increase sensitivity to predicted increases in rainfall and storminess as a result of global climate change.",0
"Land use-cover changes (LUCC) such as deforestation, have resulted as global warming and a reduction of environmental services, with large negative consequences for mankind. Effects based on statistics alone have not been sufficient enough to detect, stop and eventually revert negative LUCC processes that are strongly related to biodiversity loss. It is, therefore, of prime concern to assess and depict cartographically, major LUCC processes simultaneously. Mexico harbors a large pool of biodiversity, mostly restricted to a few locations among which, The State of Oaxaca plays a major role. In this state, nevertheless, drastic negative LUCC processes are taking place. Land cover types, mapped in previous surveys, overlaid on recent Landsat imagery and 300 ground truth sites, were used to detect current LUCC. Rates of conversion of the most important LUCC processes were computed and mapped simultaneously. Oaxaca has lost over half a million hectares of forested areas during the last 20 years. The core results may contribute to the understanding of how LUCC and GIS methods can provide better and more targeted information that may help to improve conservation policies and land use planning strategies.

"This study investigates a decadal climate shift over East Asia in winter, focusing on the changes in hydrological cycle as well as large-scale circulation using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Regional Spectral Model (RSM). The RSM is forced by perfect boundary conditions for winter (December-February) from 1979 to 2007. Analyses for two separate periods (1979-87 and 1999-2007) are performed to investigate the regional climate model's ability to simulate climate change in precipitation as well as large-scale circulation. The RSM reproduces differences in large-scale features associated with winter climate change over East Asia when the winter monsoon is modulated on decadal time scales with its weakening pattern observed since the late 1980s. The model adequately reproduces a weakening of the Siberian high and shallowness of the Aleutian low in the lower troposphere and a weakened East Asian coastal trough and East Asian jet in the upper troposphere during 1999-2007, as compared to the first nine winters of 1979-87. Conversely, the decadal shift in precipitation is not well reproduced by the model. The model is capable of reproducing the power spectrum of daily precipitation with maxima at 8.5 days and 45 days in 1979-87, whereas widely spread peaks in 1999-2007 are not captured. The increase of precipitation due to parameterized convection is prominent. This study shows that the dynamical numerical model has a limited capability to reproduce the wintertime hydrological climate over East Asia associated with global warming in recent years.",0
"The results obtained from a conventional trend analysis of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall over a larger region are contradicted when analysis is performed at a finer resolution because of spatial variability and heterogeneity in the rainfall pattern. The present study analyzes the trend of summer monsoon rainfall all over India at a finer spatial resolution (1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude) to identify the places that have a significant trend in terms of both rainfall amount and occurrence. The results obtained from this study are compared with those of a recent study by Goswami et al. (2006), where trend analysis is performed over a larger region [Central India (CI); 10 degrees latitude x 12 degrees longitude; assumed to be homogeneous in that study]. The increasing trend of occurrence of heavy rainfall and decreasing trend of occurrence of moderate rainfall, as concluded from that study, are contradicted by the present results for some places in CI. The present analysis shows spatially varying mixed responses of global warming toward rainfall occurrence and amounts all over India. The perception of increase in daily rainfall amount and occurrence due to climate change is found to be not correct for some of the regions in India. The possible reason may be the spatial variability of local changes such as rapid urbanization, industrialization and deforestation. Copyright. (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological Society",0
"Prior to the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage the risk of flooding of the Cardiff Bay waterfront was from inundation by surge tides. The barrage has substantially eliminated the probability of tidal flooding, and the residual flood risk now depends upon the ability of the inland bay to provide sufficient storage for river floodwater during periods of high tide. In the course of the feasibility and design studies the actual reduction in flood hazard was not quantified, but the design was carried out against specific combinations of tidal levels and fluvial flows. Recent research for MAFF at HR Wallingford has now made viable the assessment of the actual degree of flood risk, where flooding depends on the combination of two or more events. This paper presents a new joint probability appraisal of the standard of flood defence for the land around the inland bay, and demonstrates the conservatism incorporated in the original design methodology for flood risks. An examination of individual floods and surge tides and of the daily flow and tide records for a concurrent 18-year period has shown no positive correlation between concurrent high tides and river floods. An ISIS flow model of the Rivers Taff and Ely, the inland bay and the operation of the barrage structure was used to identify combinations of hydro-meteorological events that give specific levels in the inland bay. A statistical frequency assessment of these levels in the inland bay has provided 'return periods' for the still water level in the inland bay exceeding, for example, 7.5 m OD and 8.0 m OD. This frequency assessment was undertaken for sea levels with and without an allowance for future rise in mean sea level attributable to global warming. The ISIS modelling contained some conservative assumptions, notably the assumed coincidence between the peak of the river flow and high tide in the Bristol Channel, and the effect of these assumptions was investigated by some sensitivity tests. Finally, a best estimate of the return period for these levels in the inland bay was made using the sensitivity testing and the results of a study in 1994 of the effects of the operation of the barrage. It is concluded that the construction of the barrage is a significant flood defence benefit to Cardiff, which now has greater protection from flooding from the inland bay than the Thames Barrier provides for London. Flood risk from impoundment of the inland bay for the waterfront area remains very low even for the currently used scenarios for mean sea level rise due to global warming to the year 2100.",0
"The widely advocated statement that ecotone movement may be useful in studies of the impacts of global warming implies not only that ecotones exist but that they can be delineated spatially. With sampled field data, the accuracy of the detected ecotone is related to the data type and its spatiotemporal resolution. In the present study, I introduce two edge detection algorithms for regularly (lattice-wombling) and irregularly (triangulation-wombling) two-dimensional sampled data. I investigate the reliability of these algorithms in detecting potential ecotones using simulated vegetation data that follow the individualistic, continuum-gradient, and community-type patterns. Ecotones were defined quantitatively as long narrow regions of high rates of change. Under this definition, significant ecotones were found mostly in the community-type patterns using either of the edge detection algorithms (lattice-wombling or triangulation-wombling) and a systematic or random sampling design, respectively.",0
"A number of environmentally adapted lubricants have been proposed in response to the environmental and health impacts of metalworking fluids (MWFs). The alternatives typically substitute petroleum with vegetable-based components and/or deliver minimum quantities of lubricant in gas rather than water, with the former strategy being more prevalent than the latter. A comparative life cycle assessment of water- and gas-based systems has shown that delivery of lubricants in air rather than water can reduce solid waste by 60%, water use by 90%, and aquatic toxicity by 80%, while virtually eliminating occupational health concerns. However, air-delivery of lubricants cannot be used for severe machining operations due to limitations of cooling and lubricant delivery. For such operations, lubricants delivered in supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) are effective while maintaining the health and environmental advantages of air-based systems. Although delivery conditions were found to significantly influence the environmental burdens of all fluids, energy consumption was relatively constant under expected operating conditions. Global warming potential (GWP) increased when delivering lubricants in gas rather than water though all classes of MWFs have low GWP compared with other factory operations. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of increased GWP when switching to gas-based MWFs is a reasonable tradeoff for definite and large reductions in aquatic toxicity, water use, solid waste, and occupational health risks.",0
"The characteristic features of the surface temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere are studied on the secular time scale. The trends of the temperature anomalies over the continents and oceans were found to be opposite. The present global warming is concluded to be caused by the large-scale redistribution of heat in climatic system, indicating a compensative character of the variations observed. The dynamics of the longitudinal and latitudinal gradients of the surface temperature anomalies were analyzed. It was found that the dynamics of these gradients and the changes in the climate phases on the scales of the Northern Hemisphere are correlated. The present state of the climatic system is discussed, and it is concluded that a change in the climatic scenario in the nearest future is possible.",0
"Nutrient cations are removed from the soil by uptake in biomass, and by leaching as a result of soil acidification. Such acidification results from acid deposition and/or from HNO3 formed by mineralization and nitrification of humus, when at a rate in excess of the tree's nutritional requirements. This has been found to occur during and follwing periods of increased temperature and reduced rainfall. The cumulative loss of either Ca2+, Mg2+ or K+ by one or more of these processes, if greater than the amount released from the specific minerals in that soil, leads to nutrient deficiency, fine root mortality, poor growth, and eventually to die-back. Trees growing in soils derived from specific minerals in which there is a strong imbalance in the elements from which the exchangeable nutrients are formed, are vulnerable to nutrient deficiency. This paper discusses the relevance of earlier studies, when considered in relation to more recent findings. In Hawaii there have been frequent periods of increased temperature and drought resulting from the El Nino Southern Oscillation. This fact, when considered in relation to the relatively low K content, and its imbalance with Ca and Mg in the lava and volcanic ash on which the trees have grown, could result in K deficiency in the declining ohia trees. It is possible that the unusual periods of increased temperature and drought which have occurred in certain other localized areas may have led to the decline symptoms recently observed. In view of the threat of global warming, this possibility should be investigated.",0
"Climate-induced environmental changes are likely to have pronounced impacts on CO2 flux patterns in arctic ecosystems. We initiated a long-term experiment in 1994 in moist tussock and dry heath tundra in arctic Alaska in which we increased summer air temperature (ca. 2 degrees C) and increased winter snow accumulation (shortening the growing season approximately 4 wk). During the 1996 snow-free season, we measured ecosystem CO2 flux weekly in order to quantify net carbon gain or loss from these systems. Over the duration of the snow-free season, both dry heath and moist tussock tundra exhibited a net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, ranging from 12 to 81 g C m(-2) depending upon experimental treatment. Elevated summer temperatures accelerated net CO2 loss rates over ambient temperatures in both deep and ambient snow treatments, and increased the total amount of carbon emitted during the snow-free season by 26 to 38% in ambient snow plots and by 112 to 326% in deep snow plots. Increased snow accumulation had less impact on CO2 flux than did warming, and snow effects on total carbon loss were not consistent between the two temperature regimes. Ecosystem respiration exceeded assimilation on most sampling dates throughout the season. These data, coupled with winter carbon losses recently demonstrated in the same ecosystems, indicate that the moist and dry arctic ecosystems we examined are currently net sources of atmospheric carbon on an annual basis, and that anticipated global warming may increase carbon losses from these systems.",0
"While the abrupt climate events of the last deglaciation are well defined in ice core records from the polar regions of both hemispheres, their manifestation elsewhere is less well constrained. Here we compile 104 high-resolution paleoclimate records to characterize the timing and spatial pattern of climate change during the last deglaciation. This compilation indicates relatively concurrent timing of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; peak glacial conditions) and the Altithermal (peak interglacial conditions) in the Northern (22.1 +/- 4.3 ka and 8.0 +/- 32 ka) and Southern (22.3 +/- 3.6 ka and 7.4 +/- 3.7 ka) Hemispheres, suggesting the hemispheres were synchronized by greenhouse gases, local insolation, and/or Northern Hemisphere induced ocean circulation changes. The magnitude of the glacial interglacial temperature change increases with latitude, reflecting the polar amplification of climate change, with a likely minimum global mean cooling of similar to -4.9 degrees C during the LGM relative to the Altithermal. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of 71 records spanning 19-11 ka indicates that two modes explain 72% of deglacial climate variability. EOF1 (61% of variance) shows a globally near-uniform pattern, with its principal component (PC1) strongly correlated with changes in atmospheric CO2. EOF2 (11% of variance) exhibits a bipolar seesaw pattern between the hemispheres, with its principal component (PC2) resembling changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength. EOF analysis of 90 records from 15 to 11 ka indicates that northern and southern modes of climate variability characterize the Younger Dryas-Bolling/Allerod interval. These modes dominate at the higher latitudes of each hemisphere and exhibit a complex interaction in the tropics. The magnitude of the Younger Dryas climate anomaly (cooler/drier) increases with latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, with an opposite pattern (warmer/wetter) in the Southern Hemisphere reflecting a general bipolar seesaw climate response. Global mean temperature decreased by similar to 0.6 degrees C during the Younger Dryas. Therefore, our analysis supports the paradigm that while the Younger Dryas was a period of global climate change, it was not a major global cooling event but rather a manifestation of the bipolar seesaw driven by a reduction in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength.

"Rare plants and their habitats are integral to the conservation of biodiversity in many areas. With increasing habitat destruction and fragmentation, there is an urgent need to identify elements of diversity that are at risk, to adequately address conservation priorities, and successfully implement management strategies. In this research project, plant species rarity in rock outcrop ecosystems occurring on the Gulf Islands in southwestern British Columbia was examined at 13 study sites (3000 m(2) area examined per site). Bryophytes comprised the largest portion of rare taxa; 18 of the 20 provincially rare taxa were mosses, including two species new to Canada. Challenges facing rare plant species conservation were considered from a landscape management perspective. Rock outcrops represent non-equilibrial, primary successional systems; some form of perpetual large-scale disturbance (e. g., climate and (or) grazing) may be integral to maintaining these ecosystems, their constituent habitats, and the occurrence of many rare moss species. In contrast with vascular plants, which are of focal concern in relatively deeper-soiled Garry oak meadows (i. e., native herbs and grasses), bryophytes have limited competitive ability. As such, the rare bryophytes of rock outcrop ecosystems are likely to be highly sensitive to successional development within sites (i. e., factors reducing the availability of early successional habitats) that may arise through land use modifications and (or) changes in local climatic conditions related to global warming.",0
"Based on two kinds of remote sensing data (snow depth of Special Sensor Microwave/Imager SSM/I from 1993 to 2004, snow cover of NOAA/AVHRR from 1996 to 2004) and snow depth and snow cover days of six stations over northern Tibet from 1966 to 2003, we studied snow cover distribution in temporal and spatial scales, and analyzed the influencing factors of snow in Northern Tibet region. The result showed that the remote sensing snow data (retrieval from SSM/I, NOAA/AVHRR) was in general agreement with the weather stations data. In temporal scale, for the seasonal cycle, during 1966 to 2003, the snow cover extent increased rapidly in autumn and winter seasons in Northern Tibet. However, in spring (March-April-May), snow cover extent did not show a continual decrease, whereas indicated a positive feedback. For the interannual cycle, from the end of 1960s the snow cover of Northern Tibet region reduced, but in 1980s, the snow cover increased as a whole, and from 1990s it decreased again. Thus, the snow cover variation showed a reducing-increasing-reducing dynamic process in the study area. The result of a wavelet analysis on temporal distributions of annual cumulative snow cover indicated that there were mainly oscillation periods of quasi-2 similar to 3 yr, quasi-9 yr, quasi-13 yr, and from the beginning of 1970s to the middle of 1990s, there was an oscillation period about quasi-5 yr. In spatial scale, the east part of Northern Tibet region was the main snow cover area, where the snow cover days exceeded 15 ten-days in each winter-spring, and were obviously distinguished from the western part of Northern Tibet region. The majority of snow cover pixels exist in altitude of 4900 similar to 5600 m. The greatest variance of snow cover was found in middle and eastern part of the Northern Tibet Plateau, i.e. Andu and Nierong regions. We selected two important factors influencing snow-cover i.e., temperature, precipitation) and calculated multiple linear regressions. The result showed that the correlation coefficient between simulated annual cumulative snow days and observation data was 0.74. It revealed that temperature and precipitation are the main factors influencing the snow cover in Northern Tibet region. Global warming might be one reason causing snow cover declining in recent years in Northern Tibet region. However, the effect of precipitation seems larger than that of temperature.",0
A statistical intensity adjustment is utilized to extract information from tropical cyclone simulations in a 50 km resolution global model A simple adjustment based on the modeled and observed probability distribution of storm lifetime maximum wind speed allows the model to capture the differences between ob served intensity distributions in active/inactive year composites from the 1981-2008 period in the North Atlantic This intensity adjustment is then used to examine the atmospheric model s responses to different sea surface temperature anomalies generated by coupled models for the late twenty first century In the North Atlantic all simulations produce a reduction in the total number of cyclones but with large intermodel spread in the magnitude of the reduction The intensity response is positively correlated with changes in frequency across the ensemble However there is on average an increase in intensity in these simulations despite the mean reduction in frequency The authors argue that it is useful to decompose these intensity changes into two parts an increase in intensity that is intrinsic to the climate change experiments and a change in intensity positively correlated with frequency just as in the active/inactive historical composites By isolating the intrinsic component which is relatively independent of the details of the SST warming pattern an increase is found in storm lifetime maximum winds of 5-10 m s(-1) for storms with intensities of 30-60 m s(-1) by the end of the twenty first century The effects of change in frequency which are dependent on the details of the spatial structure of the warming must then be superimposed on this intrinsic change,0
"Soil biological parameters (e.g., Collembola), soil types, soil chemical parameters (pH, humus substances), and plant communities were studied in different ecosystems and ecotones in alpine, subalpine, and spruce forest zones in the Tatra National Park, Slovak Republic. The preliminary, selected data, based on a long-term research program, showed a high sensitivity of some alpine ecotones and ecosystems to long-distance transported acid deposits. The changes in different ecosystem parameters since 1977 were more extensive in alpine grasslands on limestone than on granite. The greatest soil pH decrease was in the plant communities Festucetum versicoloris (- 5 pH), Geranio-Alchemilletum crinitae (- 32 pH), and Saxifragetum perdurantis (- 25 pH), which are restricted to places with snow accumulation and water runoff gullies. In these ecosystems the greatest changes occurred in the leaching of humus substances. Some formerly less abundant and rare soil animals restricted to acid bedrock became dominant in some ecosystems on limestone as well as on granite; other formerly dominant species disappeared from the entire study area (e.g., Folsomia alpina). The aerial extent of some ecosystems changed substantially since 1977, and their surrounding ecotones moved into the space formerly occupied by one of the adjacent ecosystems. These changes are detectable by remote-sensing methods. In Central European mountains, strongly affected by global and regional industrial air pollution (e.g., Krusne Hory, Krkonose, Beskydy), spruce forests started to die back from higher to lower mountain elevations. The effects of air pollution on alpine and subalpine vegetation were not studied there. Strong alterations in alpine ecosystems and ecotones were detected by the author during long-term studies in the High Tatra Mountains, and I suggest that subalpine and mountain forest belts will be affected here in the near future as they were in the more polluted Central European mountains. The ecosystems and ecotones in higher alpine zones are likely to be affected earlier than the ecosystems at lower altitudes. Detection of ecosystem alteration in the alpine zone may be used for prediction of acidification processes and global change in ecosystems at lower altitudes. The consequences of global climate change are predictable by monitoring changes in the extent of some ecosystems located in discrete mountain geomorphological units (e.g., karstic sinkholes, water runoff gullies, wind shadows, ridges exposed to wind, etc.) and ecotones among them because of their dependence on duration of snow cover, water supply, wind and frost exposure, and other abiotic and biotic factors.",0
"C-14-labelled straw was mixed with soils collected from seven coniferous forests located on a climatic gradient in Western Europe ranging from boreal to Mediterranean conditions. The soils were incubated in the laboratory at 4 degrees, 10 degrees, 16 degrees, 23 degrees and 30 degreesC with constant moisture over 550 days. The temperature coefficient (Q(10)) for straw carbon mineralization decreased with increasing incubation temperatures. This was a characteristic of all the soils with a difference of two Q(10) units between the 4-10 degrees and the 23-30 degreesC temperature ranges. It was also found that the magnitude of the temperature response function was related to the period of soil incubation. Initial temperature responses of microbial communities were different to those shown after a long period of laboratory incubation and may have reflected shifts in microbial species composition in response to changes in the temperature regime. The rapid exhaustion of the labile fractions of the decomposing material at higher temperatures could also lead to underestimation of the temperature sensitivity of soils unless estimated for carbon pools of similar qualities. Finally, the thermal optima for the organic soil horizons (Of and Oh) were lower than 30 degreesC even after 550 days of incubation. It was concluded that these responses could not be attributed to microbial physiological adaptations, but rather to the rates at which recalcitrant microbial secondary products were formed at higher temperatures. The implication of these variable temperature responses of soil materials is discussed in relation to modelling potential effects of global warming.",0
"Climate change during the late Quaternary has been implicated as the cause of both massive range shifts and extinction events. We combined molecular marker data and previously published fossil data to reconstruct the late Quaternary history of a grassland-dependent species, the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), and to determine whether populations from Pleistocene refugia in the Columbia Basin, eastern Beringia, and Great Plains persisted into the Holocene and Recent eras. Using DNA extracted from 97 museum specimens of extirpated populations, we amplified 309 bp of the mtDNA control region, and 8 microsatellite markers from the nuclear genome. Overall haplotype diversity from 309 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was low (5 haplotypes, nucleotide diversity = 0.001 +/- 0.001 SD) and was contained within a single phylogenetic clade. The star phylogeny and unimodal mismatch distribution indicated that a rapid range expansion from a single Pleistocene refugium occurred. Microsatellite data corroborated this genetic pattern: populations from the mixed grasslands of the Great Plains had significantly higher expected heterozygosity and allelic richness than populations to the west (HE = 0.66 versus 0.41, AR = 4.3 versus 2.7, respectively), and 0, a measure of relative population size, was substantially greater in the east than west (2.4 versus 0.7). We infer from these data that black-footed ferrets rapidly colonized western ecoregions in a stepwise fashion from the Great Plains to the intermountain regions of the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau after the last ice age. It appears that glacial retreat and global warming caused both range expansion and localized extinction in this North American mustelid species.",0
"We measured nitrous oxide (N2O), dinitrogen (N-2) and methane (CH4) fluxes in two constructed wetlands (CW) in Estonia using the closed chamber method and the He-O method in the period from October 2000 to March 2003. Emission rates of N2O-N, N-2-N and CH4-C from both CWs varied significantly on a both spatial and temporal scale, ranging from 1 to 2,600, 170 to 130,000, and -7 to 87,200 mu g m(-2) h(-1) respectively. The average flux of N2O from the microsites in the Kodijarve horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) CW and Koo hybrid CW ranged from 27 to 370 and from 72 to 500 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), respectively, whereas the average dinitrogen flux from the microsites in the HSSF CW in Kodijarve was 2-3 magnitudes higher than the N2O flux, ranging from 19,500 to 33,300 mu g N-2-N m(-2) h(-1). The average methane emissions from the microsites in the Kodijarve HSSF CW and the Koo hybrid CW ranged from 31 to 12,100 and from 950 to 5,750 mu g CH4-C m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The highest emission values for all three gases were observed in the warm period. There was a significant relationship between emission rates and water table depth: CH4 and N-2 emission increased and N2O emission decreased when the water table did rise. Although the emission of N2O and CH4 from CWs was found to be relatively high, their global warming potential (GWP) in the time horizon of 100 years is not significant, ranging from 4.5 to 16.3 tonnes Of CO2 equivalents per ha per year in Kodijarve and from 12.1 to 17.3 t CO2 equivalents ha(-1) yr(-1) in Koo.",0
"The evidence for climate change is increasing, and global warming could lead to the extinction of some species. Here we estimated the extinction risk of six high-montane species of different taxonomic groups (fern, vascular plant, wood-inhabiting fungus, mollusk, saproxylic beetle, and bird) by modeling their occurrence under two global warming scenarios. We also assessed the cross-taxon indicator suitability of the selected species for monitoring climate change in low-mountain-range forests in southeastern Germany (Bavarian Forest National Park). We tested the influence of temperature and other habitat variables by applying semi-parametric spatial generalized linear models with binomial error. The probability of occurrence for each species under the present conditions and under two conditions of global warming was calculated. To assess the cross-taxon suitability, we tested the predictability of the final generalized linear models for each species using the measured occurrence of the other selected species and a discrimination technique. We identified temperature as the main driver for all selected high-montane species. Our statistical models predict a considerable risk of extinction of these species within the Bavarian Forest National Park as a result of global warming. Our discrimination model indicates that these species have essentially similar relationships with the environment and that five of the six species are suitable as indicators of early signs of global warming. The choice of which indicators to use should involve a consideration of the type of monitoring systems already in place. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
" Changes in plankton species diversity and community structure as a result of global warming are of growing concern in ecological studies, as these properties contribute substantially to key ecosystem processes. 2. We analysed the effect of short-term temperature rise and changes in the thermal regime during summer on plankton diversity of the eutrophic and polymictic Muggelsee in Germany, from 26 years of summer records (1982-2007). We tested for changes in community properties, such as species richness, evenness and population size of phyto- and zooplankton, during alternating periods of thermal stratification and mixing, which were between 2 and 8 weeks long. Moreover, we tested for overall long-term temporal trends in annual averages of the community properties during stratified and mixed events. 3. We found that the overall number of stratification events increased significantly across the study period. When the lake was stratified, consistently higher surface water temperatures and lower epilimnetic nutrient concentrations were found. As the length of thermal stratification increased, the phytoplankton shifted towards a higher proportion of buoyant cyanobacteria capable of N-fixation (Aphanizomenon, Anabaena). Diatoms were at a disadvantage because of high temperature, exceeding their upper lethal limit and sedimentation losses. Zooplankton species with high thermal tolerances (i.e. Thermocyclops oithonoides, Thermocyclops crassus) and/or those that grow quickly at high temperatures (i.e. rotifers) became more common. 4. During periods of continuous mixing, the community remained largely unchanged, except for some minor increase in the biomass of diatoms. 5. While a noticeable shift towards N-fixing cyanobacteria was observed with increasing length of stratified events, and rotifers and copepods became the main predators, there were minimal changes in diversity, except for an increase in cyclopoid copepods and a decrease in diatom diversity. As for cyanobacteria, the net short-term effect on their diversity was neutral as a result of species replacements. In the long term, however, the diversity of cyanobacteria and cladocerans declined while that of rotifers increased. 6. Overall, our study presents a cautionary example of how we might fail to foresee the impact of climate-induced changes on ecosystem processes if we restrict our studies to seasonal or yearly temporal scales, thus neglecting the impact of substantial changes operating at smaller temporal scales.",0
"The jabiru stork, Jabiru mycteria (Lichtenstein, 1819), a large, long-legged wading bird occurring in lowland wetlands from southern Mexico to northern Argentina, is considered endangered in a large portion of its distribution range. We conducted aerial surveys to estimate the number of jabiru active nests in the Brazilian Pantanal (140,000 km(2)) in September of 1991-1993, 1998, 2000-2002, and 2004. Corrected densities of active nests were regressed against the annual hydrologic index (AHI), an index of flood extension in the Pantanal based on the water level of the Paraguay River. Annual nest density was a non-linear function of the AHI, modeled by the equation 6.5 . 10(-8) . AHI(99) (corrected r(2) = 0.72, n = 7). We applied this model to the AHI between 1900 and 2004. The results indicate that the number of jabiru nests may have varied from about 220 in 1971 to more than 23,000 in the nesting season of 1921, and the estimates for our study period (1991 to 2004) averaged about 12,400 nests. Our model indicates that the inter-annual variations in flooding extent can determine dramatic changes in the number of active jabiru nests. Since the jabiru stork responds negatively to drier conditions in the Pantanal, direct human-induced changes in the hydrological patterns, as well as the effects of global climate change, may strongly jeopardize the population in the region.",0
"Data from weekly global measurements of nitrous oxide from 1981 to the end of 1996 are presented. The results show that there is more N2O in the northern hemisphere by about 0.7 +/- 0.04 ppbv, and the Arctic to Antarctic difference is about 2 +/- 0.1 ppbv. Concentrations at locations influenced by continental air are higher than at marine sites, showing the existence of large land-based emissions. For the period studied, N2O increased at an average rate of about 0.6 ppbv/year (similar to0.2%/year) although there were periods when the rates were substantially different. Using ice core data, a record of NO2 can be put together that goes back about 1000 years. It shows pre-industrial levels of about 287 +/- 1 ppbv and that concentrations have now risen by about 27 ppbv or 9.4% over the last century. The ice core data show that N2O started increasing only during the 20th century. The data presented here represent a comprehensive view of the present global distribution of N2O and its historical and recent trends. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",0
"At our study site in the western half of the Namib Desert rainfall is extremely low averaging between 0 and 12 mm a year. Fog events are, however, more frequent, occurring on average 60-200 days per annum Research has demonstrated that where there are frequent fog events trees have adapted to intercept and utilise the moisture from these events In hyperarid environments such as at our study site trees are confined to the banks of ephemeral rivers. Here we determine the extent to which these trees are able to utilise both deep groundwater as well as fog water The results of our model show that none of the trees in this study are able to utilise fog water even though fog events may contain considerable amounts of water. Rather, all of the trees are reliant on a seasonally fluctuating combination of groundwater, shallow soil water and deep soil water. These water sources directly depend on Kuiseb aquifer recharge resulting from flood water infiltration If predictions for increased water abstraction and global climate change are realized and water levels of the aquifer decline substantially then the vegetation structure along ephemeral rivers such as the Kuiseb will be seriously threatened.

"There is evidence that stress on coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean region is increasing. Recently numerous authors have stated that the major stress results from ""abnormally high"" seasonal sea surface temperatures (SST) and have implicated global warming as a cause, stating that recent episodes of coral bleaching result therefrom. However, an analysis of available SST data sets shows no discernible warming trend that could cause an increase in coral bleaching. Given the lack of long-term records synoptic with observations of coral ecosystem health, there is insufficient evidence available to label temperatures observed in coincidence with recent regional bleaching events as ""abnormally"" high.",0
"The biogeography of marine benthic macroinvertebrates of US Atlantic estuaries and inshore coastal areas from Delaware Bay north to Passamaquoddy Bay was studied to compare recent data with historical biogeographic studies, define physical-chemical factors affecting species' distributions, and provide information for calibrating benthic indices of environmental condition. Five years (2000-2004) of data from 614 non-polluted, soft-bottom stations from the National Coastal Assessment were analyzed. Multidimensional scaling done on Bray-Curtis similarity matrices of species' relative abundance (547 species) suggested seven subregions: two based on salinity (oligohaline, mesohaline) and five based on latitude. Species' distribution patterns for stations with salinities >= 18 (n = 558) were strongly influenced by latitude; Cape Cod was a clear faunal transition zone (R = 0.92, p<0.001). Conversely, for stations with salinities <18 (n = 56), salinity was the more important factor. An ordination of abiotic variables (temperature, salinity, sediment percent silt-clay, depth) correlated well with the ordination of species' relative abundance data (R=0.77, p<0.001). The first split of a multivariate regression tree was by a summer bottom temperature of 20 degrees C at Cape Cod. Salinity and percent silt-clay led to further splits. These results support the existence of Virginian and Transhatteran biogeographic provinces. They constitute a baseline for addressing broad-scale and long-term issues such as global climate change, species invasions, and conservation planning.",0
"Optically thin cirrus play a key role in the earth's radiation budget and global climate change. Their radiative effects depend critically on the thin cirrus optical and microphysical properties. In this paper, inhomogeneous hexagonal monocrystals (IHMs), which consist of a pure hexagon with spherical air bubble or aerosol inclusions, are applied to calculate the single-scattering properties of individual ice crystals. The multiangular polarized characteristics of optically thin cirrus for the 0.865- and 38-mu m spectral bands are simulated on the basis of an adding doubling radiative transfer program. The sensitivity of total and polarized reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) to different aerosol, cirrus, and surface parameters is studied. A new sensitivity index is introduced to further quantify the sensitivity study. The TOA polarized reflectance measured by the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) instruments is compared to simulated TOA total and polarized reflectance. The test results are reasonable, although small deviations caused by the change of aerosol properties and thin cirrus optical thickness do exist. Finally, on the basis of the sensitivity study, a conceptual approach is suggested to simultaneously retrieve thin cirrus clouds' optical thickness, ice particle shape, and the underlying aerosol optical thickness using the TOA total and polarized reflectance of the 0.865- and 38-mu m spectral bands measured. at multiple viewing angles.",0
"Species' potential distribution modelling is the process of building a representation of the fundamental ecological requirements for a species and extrapolating these requirements into a geographical region. The importance of being able to predict the distribution of species is currently highlighted by issues like global climate change, public health problems caused by disease vectors, anthropogenic impacts that can lead to massive species extinction, among other challenges. There are several computational approaches that can be used to generate potential distribution models, each achieving optimal results under different conditions. However, the existing software packages available for this purpose typically implement a single algorithm, and each software package presents a new learning curve to the user. Whenever new software is developed for species' potential distribution modelling, significant duplication of effort results because many feature requirements are shared between the different packages. Additionally, data preparation and comparison between algorithms becomes difficult when using separate software applications, since each application has different data input and output capabilities. This paper describes a generic approach for building a single computing framework capable of handling different data formats and multiple algorithms that can be used in potential distribution modelling. The ideas described in this paper have been implemented in a free and open source software package called openModeller. The main concepts of species' potential distribution modelling are also explained and an example use case illustrates potential distribution maps generated by the framework.",0
"As a consequence of global warming, additional areas will become ice-free and subject to weathering and soil formation. The most evident soil changes in the Alps will occur in proglacial areas where young soils will continuously develop due to glacier retreat. Little is known about the initial stages of weathering and soil formation, i.e. during the first decades of soil genesis. In this study, we investigated clay minerals formation during a time span 0-150 years in the proglacial area of Morteratsch (Swiss Alps). The soils developed on granitic till and were Lithic Leptosols. Mineralogical measurements of the clay (<2 mu m) and fine silt fraction (2-32 mu m) were carried out using XRD (X-ray Diffraction) and DRIFT (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform). Fast formation and transformation mechanisms were measured in the clay fraction. The decreasing proportion of trioctahedral phases with time confirmed active chemical weathering. Since the start of soil formation, smectite was actively formed. Some smectite (low charge) and vermiculite (high charge) was however already present in the parent material. Main source of smectite formation was biotite, hornblende and probably plagioclase. Furthermore, irregularly and regularly interstratified clay minerals (mica-HIV or mica-vermiculite) were formed immediately after the start of moraine exposure to weathering. In addition, hydroxy-interlayered smectite (HIS) as a transitory weathering product from mica to smectite was detected. Furthermore, since the start of soil evolution, kaolinite was progressively formed. In the silt fraction, only little changes could be detected: i.e. some formation of an interstratified mica-HIV or mica-vermiculite phase. The detected clay mineral formation and transformation mechanisms within this short time span confirmed the high reactivity of freshly exposed sediments, even in a cryic environment.

"In most alpine and arctic plants there is selection for early flowering because of the short time available to complete seed production before the season terminates. Despite this, some species initiate flowering late in the season, but little work has been done on the reproductive ecology of such species. This work investigates the reproductive consequences of late flowering in Leontodon autumnalis var. taraxaci in alpine southwest Norway during two seasons. In addition, the effects of an experimental increase in growing-season temperature on growth and reproduction are also examined. The reproductive success of Leontodon decreased strongly as the flowering season progressed, possibly as a result of increased climatic severity and increased extent of pollen and resource limitation on reproduction. Experimentally warmed plants produced significantly more and heavier seeds, and flowered more than 1 wk earlier than control plants, showing that temperature conditions influence both reproductive processes and flowering phenology. The results suggest that this late-flowering alpine species will bloom earlier, reproduce more, and grow larger under global warming.",0
"Strong winds in a tropical cyclone over the ocean can produce high seas with substantial amounts of spray in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer. The effects that the evaporation of this sea spray may have on the transfer of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere, and consequent effects on the boundary layer structure, cumulus convection, and the evolution of the tropical cyclone, are largely unknown. In this study, a high-resolution tropical cyclone model with explicit cloud microphysics, developed by Y. Wang, has been used to study these potential effects. The sea spray evaporation is incorporated into the model by two bulk parameterization schemes with quite different properties. The numerical results show that inclusion of the Fairall et at. sea spray parameterization increases the direct sensible heat flux from the ocean by about 70%, but has little effect on the direct latent heat flux. Sea spray itself causes a sensible heat flux of only about 6% of the direct sensible heat flux, while it contributes a latent heat flux by evaporation of sea spray droplets by 60%-70% of the direct latent heat flux. As a result, the total enthalpy flux with sea spray evaporation increases by about 20%, while the net contribution by sea spray is only about 5% of the total enthalpy flux. Consistent with this, the intensity of the model tropical cyclone is moderately increased by 8% in the maximum wind speed by the introduction of sea spray. The lower atmosphere becomes cooler and moister due to the evaporation of sea spray, which is supported by the available observations. The cooling in the surface layer further modifies the boundary layer structure and the activity of convection, especially in the near-core region where the highest concentration of sea spray exists. On the other hand, with the Andreas and DeCosmo parameterization scheme, the intensity of the model tropical cyclone is increased by 25% in maximum wind speed. This dramatic increase in the model tropical cyclone intensity is due to both the large net sensible heat flux and the latent heat flux associated with the effect of sea spray by this parameterization scheme. The net upward sensible heat flux warms the air near the surface and results in a near-isotherm al surface layer in the near-core environment under the tropical cyclone. Such a structure, however, is not supported by the available observations, which the authors argue is not physically realistic. The radically different results with this scheme are due to the unusual way that the feedbacks between direct and spray-mediated fluxes are handled within the parameterization.",0
"The consequences of fire on water chemistry are important considering that major changes in the frequency and intensity of forest fires are anticipated as a result of global warming. Due to the important differences in succesionnal vegetative trends after fire between mixed-wood and coniferous-dominated forests in Quebec (Canada), we undertook a long-term paleoecological study of the impact of fires on the biogeochemistry of Lac a la Pessiere, a small lake located in a conifer-dominated boreal forest ecoregion ( Picea mariana-moss domain). The paleolimnological study was carried out using diatom assemblages (class: Bacillariophyceae) to reconstruct changes in environmental variables of limnological interest [pH, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and, epilimnetic carbon dioxide (CO2)] potentially associated with fire over the last 1200 calendar years. Diatom composition and related reconstructed limnological variables were compared before and after fire events. No significant changes were systematically observed in lake chemistry associated with fire events. However, diatom-inferred epilimnetic CO2 showed a clear decreasing trend over the last similar to400 cal. yrs BP. The results suggest that fire-induced changes in lake chemistry are limited in catchments dominated by black spruce ( Picea mariana). We hypothesize that this fact result of excess moisture associated to the thick humus layer, which likely limits the mobilization of nutrients and major ions even during a fire event.",0
"Climate change has been interpreted as a contributing factor to the emergence of agriculture in the Near East. We examine how climate change may have affected the availability of food plants and their cultivation in northern Syria at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene. Charred plant remains from sites representing 11 archaeological levels indicate that during the late Pleistocene rye was commonly used, together with seeds gathered from the floodplain. During the early Holocene, rye and floodplain plants go out of use and barley then emmer wheat become common, pulses, lentils, peas and vetches increase in use and figs, chickpeas and horse beans were introduced. Pre-domestic cultivation is difficult to identify in the absence of morphologically domesticated plants. We cannot identify precisely when cultivation started but the possibility of cultivation is not excluded for the late Pleistocene, however we argue that it did not become a reliable cans of subsistence until the Holocene. This period coincides with a decrease in the amplitude of climatic M oscillations and global warming. With these conditions, combined with an increase in rainfall, we suggest cultivation developed into a sustainable economy. The earliest morphologically domestic cereals found in this area date to about 10 000 cal. yr BP. These may have been slow to become established because seed for sowing may have occasionally been replenished from the wild.",0
"The magnitude of daily minimum temperature increase is greater than that of daily maximum temperature increase under climate warming. This study was conducted to examine whether changes in soil respiration under diurnal warming are equal to the summed changes under day and night warming in a temperate steppe in northern China. A full factorial design with day and night warming was used in this study, including control, day (06:00 a.m.-06:00 p.m., local time) warming, night (06:00 p.m.-06:00 a.m.) warming, and diurnal warming. Day warming showed no effect on soil respiration, whereas night warming significantly increased soil respiration by 7.1% over the 3 growing seasons in 2006-2008. The insignificant effect of day warming on soil respiration could be attributable to the offset of the direct positive effects of increased temperature by the indirect negative effects via aggravating water limitation and suppressing ecosystem C assimilation. The positive effects of night warming on soil respiration were largely due to the stimulation of ecosystem C uptake and substrate supply via overcompensation of plant photosynthesis. Changes in both soil respiration (+20.7 g C m(-2) y(-1)) and GEP (-2.8 g C m(-2) y(-1)) under diurnal warming are smaller than their summed changes (+40.0 and +24.6 g C m(-2) y(-1), respectively) under day and night warming. Our findings that the effects of diurnal warming on soil respiration and gross ecosystem productivity are not equal to the summed effects of day and night warming are critical for model simulation and projection of climate-carbon feedback.",0
"Salinity is currently one of the most severe abiotic factors limiting agricultural production. The high rates of population growth and global warming are expected to further exacerbate the threat of salinity, especially in areas with a semi-arid climate as in the Mediterranean region. Salinity affects plant performance through the development of osmotic stress and disruption of ion homeostasis, which in turn cause metabolic dysfunctions. Particular emphasis is given on the impacts of salinity on photosynthesis because of its potential restrictions on plant growth and yield. The inhibition of photosynthesis under low to moderate salinity stress appear to be mainly attributed to diffusional limitations (stomatal and mesophyll conductance), even for salt-sensitive fruit trees such as citrus trees. In contrast, biochemical limitations to photosynthesis appear to occur only when stress becomes heavy. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms conferring salt tolerance is therefore essential under the expected climatic change, as it will enable the selection of salt-tolerant genotypes and the adoption of appropriate practices to alleviate salinity impacts on agricultural production. In fruit trees, salt tolerance is mainly associated with their ability to restrict salt accumulation in the leaves. Cell features of specific tissues, morphological factors and water-use efficiency regulate salt accumulation in the shoot. Furthermore, most fruit trees display a rapid osmotic adjustment in response to salinity, which is mainly attributed to the accumulation of inorganic ions and carbohydrates. Little information is available about the ability of horticultural crops to detoxify reactive oxygen species and to synthesize compatible solutes and hence on the potential contribution of these mechanism to induce salt tolerance in horticultural crops.

"Growth rates of juveniles and age at maturity of males were examined in a population of painted turtles, Chrysemys picta, inhabiting a marsh in southwestern Michigan (approximately 42 degrees 24'N, 85 degrees 24'W) to compare temporal variation in these two important life history traits within a decade. Elongation of the third right foreclaw was used as an indicator of incipient sexual maturity of males. Males in the late 1980s reached maturity at least a year earlier than did those in the early 1980s. Analysis of climatological data revealed that growing seasons in the late 1980s were typically warmer and longer than in the early years of the decade. The observed changes in juvenile growth rates and age at maturity of male C. picta are in accord with recent field and laboratory studies of emydid turtles. They also support predictions of life history theory, and may serve as working hypotheses that can be tested with data from other long-term projects. If substantiated, these patterns may indicate how some freshwater turtle populations in temperate latitudes might respond to predicted global warming trends.",0
"During the last few decades the tree line has shifted upward on Mediterranean mountains. This has resulted in a decrease in the area of the sub-alpine prairie habitat and an increase in the threat to strictly orophilous moths that occur there. This also occurred on the Pollino Massif due to the increase in termperature and decrease in rainfall in Southern Italy. We found that a number of moths present in the alpine prairie at 2000 m appear to be absent from similar habitats at 1500-1700 m. Some of these species are thought to be at the lower latitude margin of their range. Among them, Pareulype berberata and Entephria flavicinctata are estimated to be the most threatened because their populations are isolated and seem to be small in size. The tops of these mountains are inhabited by specialized moth communities, which are strikingly different from those at lower altitudes on the same massif further south. The majority of the species recorded in the sub-alpine prairies studied occur most frequently and abundantly in the core area of the Pollino Massif, Species and, as a consequence, communities found at high altitudes are highly vulnerable to climate warming, and need further monitoring.",0
"In most industrial settings, energy consumed by pumping systems is responsible for a major part of the overall electricity bill. In some cases, the energy is used quite efficiently; in others, it is not. Facility operators may be very familiar with pumping system equipment controllability, reliability, and availability, but only marginally aware of system efficiency. But there are some good reasons to increase that awareness: 1) As budgets shrink and the intensity of both domestic and international competition increases, the pressure to find additional of reducing costs will grow. 2) The reliability of pumps correlates with pump efficiency; that pumps operated near the design, or best efficiency point, will to perform more reliably and with greater availability. 3) The questions of whether global warming is truly occurring, and it is, whether humankind's activities play a significant role, both be debatable. But there is no debating the fact that there finite energy resources, particularly of the fossil fuel variety, on earth. If we are to be counted as good stewards, then careful, if frugal, resource use is important. The cost of energy consumed by pumps usually dominates the pump life cycle cost. But many end users, already stretched to support day-to-day facility operations, lack the time and resources to perform a methodical engineering study of, in some cases, hundreds of pumps within their facilities to understand the energy costs and the potential opportunity for reduction. Under the auspices of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Motor Challenge Program, prescreening guidance documents and a computer program called PSAT (pumping system assessment tool) have been developed to help end users, consultants, and equipment distributors recognize, both qualitatively and quantitatively, pumping system efficiency improvement opportunities. This article describes the general methodologies employed and shows case study examples of the prescreening and software application.",0
"The aim of this study is to determine the influence of atmospheric circulation on the recently observed changes in the number of warm days and cold days in Europe. The temperature series for stations in the European Climate Assessment and Data set project and the Grosswetterlagen (GWL) were used here. The temperature series were first adjusted for global warming before determining the indices for cold and warm extremes. The 29 GWLs were grouped in ten circulation types. Then, the number of days a certain circulation type occurred was determined for each winter (December, January and February) and summer (June, July and August). The relation between the circulation type frequencies and the temperature indices was modelled with a multi-regression fit over the period 1947-1974 and tested for the period 1974-2000. The difference between the observed indices and the calculated indices in the second period (using the fit coefficients for the first period) shows a warming effect for both winter and summer and for at least the warm day index, which is unaccounted for by the global warming trend. A simple snow model shows that variations in the European snow cover extent are likely influencing the cold and warm day indices in winter: there is a correlation between the decreasing trend of the snow cover extent in Europe and the increasing (decreasing) trend of the number of warm (cold) days for stations throughout Europe.",0
"The World Health Organization has developed standardized comparative risk assessment methods for estimating aggregate disease burdens attributable to different risk factors. These have been applied to existing and new models for a range of climate-sensitive diseases in order to estimate the effect of global climate change on current disease burdens and likely proportional changes in the future. The comparative risk assessment approach has been used to assess the health consequences of climate change worldwide, to inform decisions on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and in a regional assessment of the Oceania region in the Pacific Ocean to provide more location-specific information relevant to local mitigation and adaptation decisions. The approach places climate change within the same criteria for epidemiologic assessment as other health risks and accounts for the size of the burden of climate-sensitive diseases rather than just proportional change, which highlights the importance of small proportional changes in diseases such as diarrhea and malnutrition that cause a large burden. These exercises help clarify important knowledge gaps such as a relatively poor understanding of the role of nonclimatic factors (socioeconomic and other) that may modify future climatic influences and a lack of empiric evidence and methods for quantifying more complex climate-health relationships, which consequently are often excluded from consideration. These exercises highlight the need for risk assessment frameworks that make the best use of traditional epidemiologic methods and that also fully consider the specific characteristics of climate change. These include the long-term and uncertain nature of the exposure and the effects on multiple physical and biotic systems that have the potential for diverse and widespread effects, including high-impact events.",0
"Concurrent measurements of sap velocity (heat pulse) and ultrasound acoustic emission were performed on the trunks of mature Turkey oak (Quercus cerris) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea) trees, Plant water status was assessed by measuring leaf water potential, leaf conductance and transpiration, Wood density was estimated non-destructively on the trunk section of the plants by mobile computer tomography, which measures the attenuation of a collimated beam of radiation traversing the trunk in several directions, as the device rotates around the tree, Absorption is proportional to the density of the wood, As wood density is strictly correlated to water content, this non-invasive method allows the water content in the trunk section to be evaluated as well as mapped. Leaf water potential declined each morning until a minimum was reached at midday and recovered in the afternoon, lagging behind changes in transpiration rate, Good correspondence was found between the patterns of sap velocity and cavitation rate, A close correlation was demonstrated between wood density, mater content and sap velocity, Sap flow was always higher in Turkey oak than in sessile oak, Trunk signatures by computer tomography appeared to differentiate the two oak species, with the Turkey oak stem clearly more hydrated than the sessile oak; water storage reservoirs could play an important role in tree survival during extended periods of low soil water availability and in the relative distribution of tree species, especially in the context of global climate change. Late-wood conducting elements of oak species seem to play a significant role in water transport, The mobile computer tomograph was confirmed as a peerless tool for investigating stem water relations, Diurnal variations in the measured parameters under natural drought conditions and the differences between the two oak species are discussed.",0
"Using the 20-km mesh super-high-resoultion atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), precipitation changes in the global warming climate are explored for the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) region. In the warming climate, the EASM rainfall is totally projected to increase, while the rainfall over the northern part of the Korean Peninsula is projected to decrease with a slight southward movement of the monsoonal band. In relation to the Changma, the principal mode of the annual structure of precipitation exhibits a remarkable change between the present-day and future climate, representing to some extent a longer period of rainfall. The westward extension of the enhanced western North Pacific subtropical high and the enhanced atmospheric moisture content due to warming are responsible for the increase in the EASM rainfall. Change in extreme precipitation represented by the extreme climate index (i.e., P20) shows a clear increase for all of the Meiyu, Changma and Baiu. The convective instability is suggested as one of the primary source affecting the change in precipitation.",0
"Model studies point to enhanced warming and to increased freshwater fluxes to high northern latitudes in response to global warming. In order to address possible feedbacks in the ice-ocean system in response to such changes, the combined effect of increased freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean and Arctic warming-the latter manifested as a gradual melting of the Arctic sea ice-is examined using a 3-D isopycnic coordinate ocean general circulation model. A suite of three idealized experiments is carried out: one control integration, one integration with a doubling of the modern Arctic river runoff, and a third more extreme case, where the river runoff is five times the modern value. In the two freshwater cases, the sea ice thickness is reduced by 5-2 m in the central Arctic Ocean over a 50-year period. The modelled ocean response is qualitatively the same for both perturbation experiments: freshwater propagates into the Atlantic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, leading to an initial weakening of the North Atlantic Drift. Furthermore, changes in the geostrophic currents in the central Arctic and melting of the Arctic sea ice lead to an intensified Beaufort Gyre, which in turn increases the southward volume transport through the Canadian Archipelago. To compensate for this southward transport of mass, more warm and saline Atlantic water is carried northward with the North Atlantic Drift. It is found that the increased transport of salt into the northern North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas tends to counteract the impact of the increased freshwater originating from the Arctic, leading to a stabilization of the North Atlantic Drift.",0
"Accurate terrestrial glacial chronologies are needed for comparison with the marine record to establish the dynamics of global climate change during transitions from glacial to interglacial regimes. Cosmogenic beryllium-10 measurements in the Wind River Range indicate that the last glacial maximum (marine oxygen isotope stage 2) was achieved there by 21,700 +/- 700 beryllium-10 years and lasted 5900 years. Ages of a sequence of recessional moraines and striated bedrock surfaces show that the initial deglaciation was rapid and that the entire glacial system retreated 33 kilometers to the cirque basin by 12,100 +/- 500 beryllium-10 years.",0
"Soil warming has the potential to alter both soil and plant processes that affect carbon storage in forest ecosystems. We have quantified these effects in a large, long-term (7-y) soil-warming study in a deciduous forest in New England. Soil warming has resulted in carbon losses from the soil and stimulated carbon gains in the woody tissue of trees. The warming-enhanced decay of soil organic matter also released enough additional inorganic nitrogen into the soil solution to support the observed increases in plant carbon storage. Although soil warming has resulted in a cumulative net loss of carbon from a New England forest relative to a control area over the 7-y study, the annual net losses generally decreased over time as plant carbon storage increased. In the seventh year, warming-induced soil carbon losses were almost totally compensated for by plant carbon gains in response to warming. We attribute the plant gains primarily to warming-induced increases in nitrogen availability. This study underscores the importance of incorporating carbon-nitrogen interactions in atmosphere-ocean-land earth system models to accurately simulate land feedbacks to the climate system.",0
"The internal recycling process of BOF slag which is one of the huge solid wastes from iron and steel industry was emphasized. Based on the four scenarios of different internal recycling strategies for BOF slag, life cycle assessment (LCA) as a valuable tool for industrial solid waste management was applied to analyze the contribution to reducing environmental impacts and resources burdens for each scenario. The global warming potential (GWP) results of the four scenarios show that the scenario which performs best in carbon reduction cuts off 14. 2% of GWP impacts of the worst scenario. The results of this study show that the optimized internal recycling process of BOF slag can improve the environmental performance of crude steel. It is important to assess and choose an appropriate strategy to recycle BOF slag from LCA perspective to reduce the environmental impacts and resource burdens as much as possible.",0
"The chemical composition of a limed take, the two main inlets and the outlet was monitored during a period of 3 years. The winters of 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 were unusually warm while the winter of 1993-1994 was more normal. The lake surface water was wind exposed in the warm winters and as a consequence of frequent turnovers the acid input from the catchment mixed with the whole lake water body. In the winter of 1993-1994, the lake was ice-covered for approximately 4 months. During this period the drainage water from the catchment flowed to the outlet of the lake in the upper 2-3 m of the water column and only some of the acid input was neutralised. This is compared to a complete neutralisation in the winter of 1992-1993. The in-lake loss of alkalinity during this warm winter was approximately 29 mueq/l (November-June) compared to approximately 7 mueq/l lakewater in 1993-1994. Acid drainage from the catchment induced by an extraordinary rainstorm with heavy sea-salt deposition contributed to the in-lake alkalinity consumption in spring 1993. As winter temperatures above 0degreesC and more frequent rainstorms may be common due to expected global warming, future increased lime consumption in-lakes may be projected in acidified areas as southern Norway.

"Changes in surface air temperature during the last century are widely discussed among researches in the field of climate change. This paper measures the variability of annual surface air temperature of five major cities of Pakistan (Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Hyderabad and Karachi) for the period from 1882 to 2003. We perform an exploratory analysis which shows that the annual landmass air temperature series of five relatively more important climate stations of Pakistan obey the normal distribution. A subsequent trend analysis shows that the temperature has been increasing in the twentieth century for the five (major) cities of Pakistan, the increase being 0.3A degrees C to 0A degrees C. We computations based on Bayesian analysis for two samples (e.g., for Lahore, we use data for the period from 1882 to 1960 and 1961-2000 for first sample and second sample, respectively) of temperature data of five cites shows that the average of annual mean temperature for the second period is higher than the average of first period. Thus, Bayesian inferencing shows that the general pattern of evolution of temperature over Pakistan is pretty similar to the current global warming configuration.",0
"Throughout its long history the Earth has undergone warm periods with high atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG), and has responded with different buffering mechanisms whereby atmospheric C has been transferred to other geochemical compartments. Strategies for the mitigation and adaptation to the current climatic forcing may thus be generated by the acceleration of such natural mechanisms, especially those involved in short cycles, mainly in the biosphere and the pedosphere. Although these contain smaller C stocks than other compartments (< 0.01% of the total C), they circulate large amounts of C from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and mineral weathering (e. g., 120 Pg C are circulated through terrestrial ecosystems and total C in the atmospheric compartment is 805 Pg C). Increased C sequestration can thus be achieved in terrestrial ecosystems, by: (1) favouring growth of biomass; (2) promoting and facilitating carbonation processes; (3) reducing erosion and favouring pedogenesis; (4) developing organic matter-rich horizons; (5) recovering degraded or contaminated soils, and/or (6) managing waste by use of systems that minimize emissions of GHG. Within the latter option, the following actions are considered here in more detail: 1) production of Technosols, and 2) production of biochar. All of the above options should form part of a strategy for the mitigation and adaptation to global climate change. In this review, we analyze those focused on promoting soil conservation, soil restoration and soil formation.",0
"From the viewpoint of mitigating global warming by SF6 gas, this paper discusses breakdown (BD) characteristics of different electronegative gas mixtures with N2O gas as SF6 gas substitutes for quasi-uniform electric field under lightning impulse voltage applications. Experimental results revealed the positive synergism in breakdown strength of binary N2O/CO2 and ternary N2O/CO2/O-2 gas mixtures, respectively. Furthermore, N-2 gas as a retardant gas was also mixed with the electronegative gas mixtures in order to reduce the electron energy into the effective levels of electron attachment ability by the electronegative gas mixtures. As the result, ternary N2O/CO2/N-2 and quaternary N2O/CO2/O-2/N-2 gas mixtures could exhibit the significant synergistic effect in breakdown strength. The optimum mixture rate of quaternary N2O/CO2/O-2/N-2 gas mixtures was consistent with that estimated by assuming the independent contribution of component gases to the improvement of impulse BD characteristics.",0
"After four growing seasons, soil below white oak trees exposed to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (ambient + 300 ppm) had an average of 14% more soil carbon than soil below trees exposed to ambient levels of carbon dioxide. The soil carbon inventories in five soil cores collected from ambient chambers and six soil cores collected from elevated chambers at the Global Change Field Research Site, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, were measured. The authors conclude that the increase in soil carbon was due to an increase in belowground soil carbon input, because aboveground litter inputs were excluded by experimental design. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated carbon dioxide levels are increasing the amount of carbon stored in soil.",0
"The potential impact of global warming on sea-level rise in the Hudson Bay area was examined. Land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of ocean waters were compared to isostatic rebound rates. Thermal expansion was estimated using a one-dimensional analysis and a three-dimensional world ocean general circulation model. It was found that the combined impact on sea-level rise of land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of the world ocean was the same order of magnitude as the sea-level fall rates due to isostatic rebound. Thus, there is the possibility of a cessation or reversal of sea-level fall in the Hudson Bay area in the next 100 yr.",0
"Our ability to predict whether elevated atmospheric CO2 will alter the cycling of C and N in terrestrial ecosystems requires understanding a complex set of feedback mechanisms initiated by changes in C and N acquisition by plants and the degree to which changes in resource acquisition (C and N) alter plant growth and allocation. To gain further insight into these dynamics, we grew six genotypes of Populus tremuloides Michx. that differ in autumnal senescence (early vs, late) under experimental atmospheric CO2 (35.7 and 70.7 Pa) and soil-N availability (low and high) treatments. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were manipulated with open-top chambers, and soil-N availability was modified in open-bottom root boxes by mixing different proportions of native A and C horizon soil. Net N mineralization rates averaged 61 ng N.g(-1).d(-1) in low-N soil and 319 ng N.g(-1).d(-1) in high-N soil. After 2.5 growing seasons, we harvested above- and belowground plant components in each chamber and determined total biomass, N concentration, N content, and the relative allocation of biomass and N to leaves, stems, and roots. Elevated CO2 increased total plant biomass 16% in low-N soil and 38% in high-N soil, indicating that the growth response of P. tremuloides to elevated CO2 was constrained by soil-N availability. Greater growth under elevated CO2 did not substantially alter the allocation of biomass to above- or belowground plant components. At both levels of soil-N availability, elevated CO2 decreased the N concentration of all plant tissues. Despite declines in tissue N concentration, elevated CO2 significantly increased whole-plant N content in high-N soil (ambient = 137 g N/chamber; elevated = 155 g N/chamber), but it did not influence whole-plant N content in low-N soil (36 g N/chamber). Our results indicate that plants in high-N soil obtained greater amounts of soil N under elevated CO2 by producing a proportionately larger fine-root system that more thoroughly exploited the soil. The significant positive relationship between fine-root biomass and total-plant N content we observed in high-N soil further supports this contention. In low-N soil, elevated CO did not increase fine-root biomass or production, and plants under ambient and elevated CO2 obtained equivalent amounts of N from soil. In high-N soil, it appears that greater acquisition of soil N under elevated CO2 fed forward within the plant to increase rates of C acquisition, which further enhanced plant growth response to elevated CO2.",0
"Conventional working fluids (refrigerants) are being phased out worldwide to combat with the twin menace of ozone layer depletion and global warming and natural refrigerants are fast gaining favour lately. Single stage and multi stage refrigeration systems fail to widen the gap between heat source and heat sink temperatures required in many industrial applications requiring simultaneous heating and cooling and cascaded systems appear to be the best alternative. Modest research has been done in cascaded systems based on natural refrigerants thereby offering good potential for research. In this paper, a cascaded system for simultaneous heating and cooling (refrigeration and heat pump system) with a carbon dioxide based HT cycle and propane based LT cycle for simultaneous refrigeration and heating applications has been analyzed. To facilitate prediction of optimum performance parameters, performance trends with variation in the design parameters and operating variables have been presented in this article. Relevant expressions have been developed to serve as guidelines to the user for selecting appropriate design parameters like intermediate temperature so that the system yields optimum performance. Independently developed property codes have been employed for both carbon dioxide and propane for higher accuracy. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.",0
"Introduction of non-indigenous species can generate new trophic interactions that may facilitate or control their spread. The first recorded Atlantic population of the mytilid Xenostrobus seams, originally from New Zealand, offers an opportunity to examine how native predators may control the outcome of invasions. Laboratory experiments were done to evaluate the impact of the native crab. Carcinus maenas, on 2 species of mussels, X. securis and the native Mytilus galloprovincialis, at 3 different temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degrees C). In addition, we investigated handling time, breaking time and profitability for both species of mussel. We tested the hypotheses that (1) C. maenas exerts a greater predation pressure on the native mussel and (2) C. maenas increases its ingestion of the most profitable species of mussel at higher temperatures. The first hypothesis was supported because C maenas consumed greater than twice as many native mussels as invasive ones at all temperatures. This greater consumption of M. galloprovincialis could be explained by its greater profitability and shorter handling and breaking time. These results are in concordance with the enemy release hypothesis suggesting that C. maenas might facilitate the invasion of X. securis. The consumer-prey relationship was not significantly affected by temperature although the number of X. securis ingested by C maenas tended to decrease with increasing temperature, whereas the number of M. galloprovincialis consumed increased at the highest temperature. Results, therefore, suggest that global warming could enhance the facilitation of the invasion of X. securis due to its lower profitability and greater handling and breaking time.

"In this paper, the cloud statistics and global cloud distributions are derived from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) level 2, 5 km lidar cloud-layer products between 13 June 2006 and 24 June 2007. The global cloud-layer occurrence frequency, the horizontal and the vertical distributions of cloud-occurrence frequency, the global cloud-top height statistics and their seasonal changes are given for 1 year CALIPSO observations. Opaque cloud-layer statistics are analysed for better understanding the statistics of the clouds observed using CALIPSO. Parts of the results are compared with some results from the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) observations, the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) observations and the global rawinsonde observations, the Aqua MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly cloud-fraction data. The comparisons show that results are in agreement with other observations. Due to the primary advance from the active optical sensing, CALIPSO lidar can offer measurements of accurate, highly resolved vertical profiles of atmospheric scattering layers. It has advantages in determining the location of optically thin clouds and detecting occurrences of multiple layers. Long-term observations by CALIPSO lidar can provide valuable information for the better understanding of the climate system and global climate change.",0
"Arid and semi-arid environments are dynamic ecosystems with highly variable precipitation, resulting in diverse plant communities. Changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation due to global climate change may further alter plant community composition in desert regions. In this study, we assessed changes in species richness and plant density at the community, functional group, and species level in response to variation in the magnitude of natural seasonal precipitation and 25% increases in seasonal precipitation [e.g., supplemental watering in summer, winter, or summer and winter (SW)] over a 5-year period in a sotol grassland in the Chihuahuan Desert. Community species richness was higher with increasing winter precipitation while community plant density increased with greater amounts of winter and summer precipitation, suggesting winter precipitation was important for species recruitment and summer precipitation promoted growth of existing species. Herb and grass density increased with increasing winter and summer precipitation, but only grass density showed a significant response to supplemental watering treatments (SW treatment plots had higher grass density). Shrubs and succulents did not exhibit changes in richness or density in response to natural or supplemental precipitation. In this 5-year study, changes in community species richness and density were driven by responses of herb and grass species that favored more frequent small precipitation events, shorter inter-pulse duration, and higher soil moisture. However, due to the long life spans of the shrub and succulent species within this community, 5 years may be insufficient to accurately evaluate their response to variable timing and magnitude of precipitation in this mid-elevation grassland.",0
"The nature of ""climate change"" will differ with geographical regions and its final impact on ecosystems vary with the extent of temperature increase, changes in irradiance and levels of UVB, amount and patterns of precipitation and humidity, and alterations in the incidence and nature of abiotic disturbances. Despite many uncertainties, there is consensus in the fact that global warming already has and will have impact on the temporal and spatial dynamics of insect herbivores. Ectothermic organisms are affected by the changes in environmental conditions directly in dispersal, reproduction, development and mortality, and indirectly through altered plant nutritional quality, resistance and via community interactions. Ambiguous consequences are to be expected depending on the individual host plant and herbivore species, probably involving altered incidence and intensity of pest outbreaks and changes in distributional ranges. Regions that represent northern or upper limits of occurrence, such as the Alps or the boreal zone, are likely to be affected most by an increase in stability and population density of certain pest species, such as defoliating insects or bark beetles. At the same time, temperature increase and drought will render areas of distribution in southern and continental parts of Europe less suitable for heat susceptible species, which will probably not only result in northwards shifts, but range contractions. The review is based on chapters of the ""Study on impacts of climate change on European forests and options for adaptation"" led by the European Forest Institute (Efi) and on results of the EU project ""PROMOTH - Global change and pine processionary moth: a new challenge for integrated pest management"". Thaumetopoea piryocampa serves as illustrative example for insect herbivores whose latitudinal and altitudinal distribution is mainly controlled by temperature and already modified by global warming.

"There is increasing evidence that the globe is currently warming, with changes being more pronounced in northern latitudes. Understanding the ecological effects of climatic variability is therefore important. There is recent support for the idea that a large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), through its effects on vegetation and regional weather conditions, influences several aspects of life histories and population dynamic processes of several mammal species, including reindeer Rangifer tarandus. However, patterns are inconsistent both between species and within species. Here, we focus on reindeer, a herbivore that inhabits an extremely seasonal environment. We review and discuss predicted patterns of global climatic change in Norway and assess potential consequences for reindeer husbandry. We argue that although it is clearly shown that local and global climate affect reindeer directly (e.g. increased energetic costs of moving through deep snow and in accessing forage through snow) and indirectly (e.g. effect on forage plant biomass and quality, level of insect harassment and associated parasitism), it is difficult to predict a general pattern of how future climate change will influence this species. It is especially difficult to predict how reindeer husbandry (an important economic and cultural activity for the Saami People) will be affected in Norway. Indeed, (1) patterns in life history traits and Population parameters of reindeer vary over space and time, (2) both temperature and precipitation will increase in Norway, with greater changes in the North, i.e. the areas with reindeer husbandry, but the rate of increase will vary with space and seasons, (3) there are several indirect effects of global warming that can complicate the ecological response, especially involving the response of vegetation (e.g. forage on which reindeer depend), and (4) spatial variation, seasonality, complexity of the ecosystem functioning and nonlinearity of ecological processes make any firm prediction uncertain. Consequently, it is difficult to assess the practical and socio-economic implications for the reindeer husbandry industry.",0
"The operation performance of building cooling, heating and power (BCHP) system is dependent on the seasonal atmospheric conditions. This paper presents the environmental impact models of separation production (SP) system and BCHP system respectively. Three most important energy-related environmental issues, global warming, acid precipitation and stratospheric ozone depletion, are considered to evaluate the environmental impact of BCHP system for a commercial building located in five climate zones, China. Because the global emissions of BCHP system are related to the central power plant that provides the additional electricity to building, the environmental impacts by coal-fired and gas-fired power plants are compared and discussed. The results indicate that the emission reduction potential of BCHP system over SP system in hot summer zone and mild zone is larger than in severe cold zone when the coal-fired power plant is used. Contrarily, BCHP system in severe cold zone reduces more emissions than in hot summer zone when the gas-fired power plant provides the additional electricity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Temperature is a major factor for ectothermic organisms, directly affecting biochemical and physiological processes. The increase in temperature and its effects have prompted many climate change studies, many of which focus on latitudinal gradients as they readily provide contrasting thermal regimes. In this study we evaluated the response in terms of growth, survival, and reproduction rates of two latitudinally separate populations of Asellus aquaticus (L.) to high temperature (30 degrees C). The comparisons revealed i) differences between the two populations, with higher tolerance found in the southern group, as well as between genders and body size classes. Only individuals from the southern population were able to complete the biological cycle at 30 degrees C, and no individuals from the northern population survived after 60 days; ii) differences between life stages: the survival rate of juveniles was greater than that of adults and the southern population had the highest proportion of temperature-resistant juveniles. The results confirm the importance of body size in the response to rising temperature and suggest that life stage should be taken into account in thermal adaptation studies. Analyses of intraspecific variability across different thermal regimes associated with the different latitudes illustrate how rising temperature can affect biological traits.",0
"Disease is emerging as an important impact of global climate change, due to the effects of environmental change on host organisms and their pathogens. Climate-mediated disease can have severe consequences in natural systems, particularly when ecosystem engineers, such as habitat-formers or top predators are affected, as any impacts can cascade throughout entire food webs. In temperate marine ecosystems, seaweeds are the dominant habitat-formers on rocky reefs. We investigated a putative bleaching disease affecting Delisea pulchra, a chemically defended seaweed that occurs within a global warming 'hot-spot' and assessed how patterns of this phenomenon were influenced by ocean temperature, solar radiation, algal chemical defences and microbial pathogens. Warmer waters were consistently and positively correlated with higher frequencies of bleaching in seaweed populations, but patterns of bleaching were not consistently influenced by light levels. Bleached thalli had low levels of antibacterial chemical defences relative to healthy conspecifics and this was observed across entire thalli of partially bleached algae. Microbial communities associated with bleached algae were distinct from those on the surfaces of healthy seaweeds. Direct testing of the importance of algal chemical defences, done here for the first time in the field, demonstrated that they protected the seaweed from bleaching. Treatment of algal thalli with antibiotics reduced the severity of bleaching in experimental algae, especially at high water temperatures. These results indicate that bleaching in D. pulchra is the result of temperature-mediated bacterial infections and highlight the potential for warming to influence disease dynamics by stressing hosts. Understanding the complex ways in which global change may affect important organisms such as habitat-forming seaweeds, is essential for the management and conservation of natural resources.",0
"Chongce Ice Cap (35 degrees 14'N, 81 degrees 07'E), located in the south margin of Taklimakan Desert, West Kunlun Mts. of China was sampled by coring in 1992, and this provides us with climate proxy of high altitudes (6,530 m). Through analyzing the weather observation stations surrounding Taklimakan Desert, the climate record of Hotan station was chosen to be the representative of low altitudes. Wavelet analysis were used to investigate the climatic variations of patterns, cycles and frequencies of different altitudes from 1954 to 1992, and different responses of different altitude surrounding Taklimakan Desert to global warming were recorded: (1) coherent decline of snow accumulation rate and dust deposition of high altitude recorded in Chongce ice core; (2) coherent increase of summer half-year precipitation and SAT of Hotan; (3) consistent variation tendency between dust deposit recorded in Chongce ice core and Hotan spring sandstorm days; (4) opposite variation tendency between Hotan precipitation and Chongce ice core snow accumulation rate and consistent cycles in general. By analyzing the mechanism of different responses, the predominant factors were determined of different altitudes: (1) at the low altitude, the vapor supply is predominant, and more vapor supplying means more precipitation; (2) at the high altitude, probably the population of dust aerosols which act as cloud ice nuclei in high altitude takes advantage over the vapor supply to affect the precipitation, and so the dust aerosol population reducing results in the wet deposition being reduced, thus the dust aerosol is the predominant factor.",0
"Clothes are often discarded when much of their potential lifetime is left. Many charitable organizations therefore collect used clothing and resell it as second-hand clothes for example in Eastern Europe or Africa. In this connection, the question arises whether reusing clothes actually results in a decrease of the environmental burden of the life cycle of clothing. The environmental burden of clothing has been studied in several studies. However, most of these studies focus solely on the energy consumption aspects and pay little attention to the potential benefits of diverting used clothing from the waste stream. The aim of the study was to assess the net environmental benefits brought by the disposal of used clothing through charities who return them for second-hand sales assuming that second-hand clothes to some extent replace the purchase of new clothes. The extent to which second-hand clothes (SHC) introduces such a replacement was investigated applying a methodology in which a questionnaire-based survey was conducted on more than 200 consumers in second-hand shops. The survey was done in Sweden and Estonia, and Africa was included by estimation. Based on the identification of the different profiles of the consumers questioned, a methodology was developed to get a quantitative evaluation of the replacement of new clothes enabled by second-hand clothing consumption. A life cycle assessment was conducted based on the EDIP methodology. The life cycle impacts of clothes that are directly disposed of by incineration were compared with the life cycle impacts of clothes that are collected and sorted after consumer use in order to be reused. Two products were assessed: a cotton T-shirt and a pair of polyester (65%)/cotton (35%) trousers. The functional unit was 100 garments in the use stage. Based on the survey result and the methodology applied, the purchase of 100 second-hand garments would save between 60 and 85 new garments dependent of the place of reuse. Based on information about the second-hand clothing activities conducted by Humana People to People in Sweden and Estonia, it was assumed that over 100 collected items 60 would be reused, 30 recycled in other ways, and ten go to final disposal. Using these inputs, the LCA showed that the collection, processing, and transport of second-hand clothing has insignificant impacts on the environment in comparison to the savings that are achieved by replacing virgin clothing. The reduction of impacts resulting from collecting 100 garments for reuse range from 14% decrease of global warming for the cotton T-shirt to 45% reduction of human toxicity for the polyester/cotton trousers. The approach applied is a fair way of establishing the net benefits from introducing clothes reuse. Indeed, it enables to take into consideration all the activities connected to reusing clothes, including, for instance, recycling and disposal of the collected clothes not suitable for reuse. In addition, the routes followed by the collected clothes have been determined based on real figures. A main assumption concerns the estimation of avoided production of new clothes brought by clothes reuse. The method used, based on questionnaires, could be further developed but still suggests an approach on an issue that had not been investigated so far. The results of the study show that clothes reuse can significantly contribute to reducing the environmental burden of clothing. It would be beneficial to apply other methods for estimating the avoided production of new clothes in order to check the validity and reliability of the results obtained in the current study. Such further work could include the possible difference in the lifetime of second-hand clothes compared to new clothes.",0
" We examined the detailed temperature dependence (0-40 degrees C) of bacterial metabolism associated with fine sediment particles from three Danish lowland streams to test if temperature dependence varied between sites, seasons and quality of organic matter and to evaluate possible consequences of global warming. 2. A modified Arrhenius model with reversible denaturation at high temperatures could account for the temperature dependence of bacterial metabolism and the beginning of saturation above 35 degrees C and it was superior to the unmodified Arrhenius model. Both models overestimated respiration rates at very low temperatures (< 5 degrees C), whereas Ratkowsky's model - the square root of respiration - provided an excellent linear fit between 0 and 30 degrees C. 3. There were no indications of differences in temperature dependence among samples dominated by slowly or easily degradable organic substrates. Optimum temperature, apparent minimum temperature, Q(10)-values for 0-40 degrees C and activation energies of bacterial respiration were independent of season, stream site and degradability of organic matter. 4. Q(10)-values of bacterial respiration declined significantly with temperature (e.g. 3.31 for 5-15 degrees C and 43 for 25-35 degrees C) and were independent of site and season. Q(10)-values of bacterial production behaved similarly, but were significantly lower than Q(10)-values of respiration implying that bacterial growth efficiency declined with temperature. 5. A regional warming scenario for 2071-2100 (IPCC A2) predicted that mean annual temperatures will increase by 3.5 degrees C in the air and 2.2-4.3 degrees C in the streams compared with the control scenario for 1961-1990. Temperature is expected to rise more in cool groundwater-fed forest springs than in open, summer-warm streams. Mean annual bacterial respiration is estimated to increase by 26-63% and production by 18-41% among streams assuming that established metabolism-temperature relationships and organic substrate availability remain the same. To improve predictions of future ecosystem behaviour, we further require coupled models of temperature, hydrology, organic production and decomposition.",0
"It is established that the slowing down of global warming, which has been observed during the past decade, is due to the counteraction of natural factors and, primarily, to the reduction in solar activity and transition of the North Atlantic Oscillation to the regular negative phase. Warming is supposed to resume in the years to come, although at a lower rate than during the past 30 years.",0
"Global warming and the predicted adverse environmental implications in coastal areas haw prompted the use of a quantitative pedological approach to model the history of relative sea-level rise and the subsequent lateral migration of marshes (deforestation) during the pedogenic transformation of Ultisols (forest soils) to Histosols (marsh soils). The modeling was based on the transgressing soil-landscape concept and data collected from sampling units along two marsh transects in Dorchester County, Maryland. In low-relief submerging environments, coastal marshes accrete vertically and migrate laterally over adjacent Ultisols to keep pace with sea-level rise. The marsh substrate is organic in nature overlying what once were upland forest soils. The history of relative sea-level rise was a two-step linear function illustrating acceleration in the last two centuries. During the last 150 yr, the (210)Pb-based rare of relative sea-level rise averaged 2.4 +/- 0.7 min yr(-1). Before the last few hundred years, the long-term (14)C-based rate of relative sea-level rise was 0.82 +/- 0.15 mm yr(-1). The race of lateral migration of coastal marshes (deforestation) showed similar acceleration following the history of relative sea-level rise. During the last 150 yr, the average rate of lateral migration of marshes (deforestation) ranged from 3.51 +/- 2.0 to 6.78 +/- 7.4 m yr(-1). Before the last 150 yr, the average long-term rate of lateral migration of marshes (deforestation) ranged between 0.18 +/- 0.07 and 27 +/- 2 m yr(-1). Within a given region where sea-level rise and tidal range remain constant, the rate of lateral migration of marshes is a function of site characteristics and the slope of the adjacent uplands. The predicted rate of lateral migration of marshes in the next century ranges from 3.2 to 33 in yr(-1), averaging 14 +/- 11 in yr(-1). Assuming that the present rate of relative sea-level rise remains constant, the time needed to complete the pedogenic transformation of Ultisols to Histosols is 180 +/- 35 yr. The most conservative future scenario of sea-level rise has reduced this time by 63%. The projected sequestration of C, total N, and pyrite in the newly formed coastal marshes during the next 100 yr average 231 +/- 124, 17 +/- 6.30, and 6.63 +/- 3.57 Mg ha(-1), respectively. These projections are half the nutrient sequestration potential of existing coastal marshes.",0
"Permafrost - a widespread constituent of the terrestrial environment - by definition is dependent upon the ambient temperature for its existence and properties. Thus, it is very sensitive to climatic changes. Simple relations based upon conductive heat transfer, with thawing and geothermal heat flow, are presented to predict the transient effects of surface temperature increases on the thermal state of permafrost. The results indicate that, based on the usual global warming scenarios, relatively small amounts of permafrost will disappear within 50-100 years. This is specifically shown for the most thermally sensitive cases, that is, warm or relict permafrost.",0
"A continuous age model for the brief climate excursion at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary has been constructed by assuming a constant flux of extraterrestrial He-3 (He-3(ET)) to the seafloor. (HeET)-He-3 measurements from ODP Site 690 provide quantitative evidence for the rapid onset ( < few kyr) and short duration ( < 120 kyr) of global warming and of the associated disturbance to the Earth's surficial carbon budget at this time. These observations support astronomically calibrated age models indicating extremely rapid release of isotopically light carbon, possibly from seafloor methane hydrate, as' the proximal cause of the event. However, the He-3(ET) technique indicates a previously unrecognized and extreme increase in sedimentation rate coincident with the return of climate proxies to pre-event values. The He-3(ET)-based age model thus suggests a far more rapid recovery from the climatic perturbation than previously proposed or predicted on the basis of the modern carbon cycle, and so may indicate additional or accelerated mechanisms of carbon removal from the ocean-atmosphere system during this period. He-3(ET) was also measured at ODP Site 1051 to test the validity of the Site 690 chronology. Comparison of these data sets seems to require removal of several tens of kyr of sediment within the climatic excursion at Site 1051, an observation consistent with sediment structures and previous age modeling efforts. The Site 1051 age model shows a similar to30 kyr period in which climate proxies return toward pre-event values, after which they remain invariant for similar to80 kyr. If this rise represents the recovery interval identified at Site 690, then the 3 HeET-based age models of the two sites are in good agreement. However, alternative interpretations are possible, and work on less disrupted sites is required to evaluate the reliability of the proposed new chronology of the climate excursion. Regardless of these details, this work shows that the 3HeET technique can provide useful independent evidence for the development and testing of astronomically calibrated age models.

"Palynological and sedimentological data from a core extracted from Lake Eteza shed new light on the Holocene vegetation and climate history in KwaZulu-Natal and can be linked to regional and global climate change. A 2072 cm core with nineteen radiocarbon dates and chronological extrapolation to the bottom of the sequence suggests that sedimentation started ca. 10200 cal yrs BP. Between ca. 10200 and 6800 cal yrs BP pollen indicators point to a change from intermediately humid conditions to comparatively drier grassy environments. This is in good agreement with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fluctuations from a core in the Mozambique Channel which influence precipitation in coastal KwaZulu-Natal, and the beginning of the Holocene Thermal Maximum ca. 10500 cal yrs BP. The lower section of the core corresponds to gradually increasing Holocene sea levels along the coast and development of freshwater or estuarine conditions at Lake Eteza. The middle Holocene (ca. 6800-3600 cal yrs BP), when the sea level reached its highest stand and SST peak, indicate humid climatic conditions that favoured an increase of forest trees, e.g. Podocarpus, and undergrowth plants like Issoglossa. As a consequence of higher precipitation and increase of the water table, conditions were favourable for the spread of mangrove, swamp and possibly riverine forest. During the late Holocene after ca. 3600 cal yrs BP a decrease of Podocarpus and other trees as well as an increase of Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, grasses and Phoenix coincide with a return to lower sea levels and drier conditions. The decrease of all trees including Phoenix at ca. 700 cal yrs BP, accompanied by rapid sedimentation rates, possibly reflect forest clearing and upland erosion induced by activities of Iron Age settlers. A dry period at the globally recognized onset of the Little Ice Age might have contributed to these changes. Late Iron Age settlers have probably already introduced Zea mays, which was detected in the profile since ca. 210 BP. The appearance of neophytes like Pinus, Casuarina and pollen of Ambrosia-type in the youngest sediments indicates increased disturbance of European settlements and land use since ca. 100 cal yrs BP.

" Glaciers in Iceland began retreating around 1890, and since then the Vatnajokull ice cap has lost over 400 km 3 of ice. The associated unloading of the crust induces a glacio-isostatic response. From 1996 to 2004 a GPS network was measured around the southern edge of Vatnajokull. These measurements, together with more extended time series at several other GPS sites, indicate vertical velocities around the ice cap ranging from 9 to 25 mm/yr, and horizontal velocities in the range 3 to 4 mm/yr. The vertical velocities have been modeled using the finite element method (FEM) in order to constrain the viscosity structure beneath Vatnajokull. We use an axisymmetric Earth model with an elastic plate over a uniform viscoelastic half-space. The observations are consistent with predictions based on an Earth model made up of an elastic plate with a thickness of 10-20 km and an underlying viscosity in the range 4-10 x 10(18) Pa s. Knowledge of the Earth structure allows us to predict uplift around Vatnajokull in the next decades. According to our estimates of the rheological parameters, and assuming that ice thinning will continue at a similar rate during this century (about 4 km 3/year), a minimum uplift of 2.5 meters between 2000 to 2100 is expected near the current ice cap edge. If the thinning rates were to double in response to global warming (about 8 km 3/year), then the minimum uplift between 2000 to 2100 near the current ice cap edge is expected to be 3.7 meters.",0
"Background, aims, and scope Food is a vital human need that not only provides essential nutrition but is also a key part of our social life as well as being a valued sensory experience. However, food, or rather the production chain of food, from primary production (agriculture/aquaculture/fishing) to consumer and beyond, also results in some form of environmental impact, as does transport between steps. There are several life cycle assessment studies of food products, most of them analysing the impact of the food chain of single food items. Still, detailed studies of complete meals are less frequent in the literature. In the Swedish study presented in this article, the environmental impacts of two different chicken meals (homemade and semi-prepared) were analysed. The aim of the study was to gain knowledge of the environmental impact of integrated food chains and also to explore the effect of improvement measures in the post-farm systems. To this end, two chicken meals were chosen for analysis, with two scenarios for each meal; the first scenario reflects the present conditions of the food chain, and the second scenario incorporates a number of improvement actions in the stages after the farm. Materials and methods Input data to the model were based mainly on previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of Swedish food products and studies on wastage and consumer transport. Food engineering data and information from producing companies were used for modelling the industries. The improvement scenario was constructed using insight from a preceding LCA study of a meatball meal (Sonesson et al., Ambio, 34:411-418, 2005a) along with goals set out by a Swedish agreement between representatives from national and regional government, food industry sectors and retailers. The impact assessment was conducted according to Lindfors et al. (Nordic guidelines on life cycle assessment, The Nordic Council of Ministers, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1995), and the following environmental effects were included: global warming potential, eutrophication potential, acidification potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and use of primary energy carriers and secondary energy. Results In terms of energy use, the largest part is used in the steps after the farm for both meal types. Hence, the changes made in the improvement scenario have a significant impact on the total energy use. For the homemade and semi-prepared meal, the reduction is 15% and 20% respectively, not only due to less consumer transport and packaging but also reduction in industry (semi-prepared). Agriculture is also a significant contributor to emissions of greenhouse gases and eutrophying emissions; for the homemade meal, around 40% of the greenhouse gases originate from agriculture, and for the semi-prepared meal, the figure is 50%. The improvement actions with the greatest reduction in greenhouse gases are, again, less consumer transport and, in the case of the semi-prepared meal, the reduction in energy use in industry. Regarding eutrophication, more than 90% of the emissions originate from agriculture. Hence, the only improvement action that has an effect here is the utilisation of raw material downstream in the production chain; a slight reduction in waste still gives a notable reduction in overall eutrophic emissions. Discussion There are two significant areas of research to reduce the impact of meals that are not explored in this study: choice of meal components and production methods in agriculture. However, the aim with this study was to explore if there are further ways of reducing the impact without going into these very complex areas, and our conclusion is that there are effective ways in the post-farm chain to cut emissions that, together with choices of diet and agricultural research, can significantly reduce the impact of our food consumption. Conclusions Actions in the post-farm chain that can significantly reduce the environmental impact of a meal are less food thrown away in the household, fewer car trips to the supermarket (e.g. only once a week) and, for semi-prepared food products, more efficient energy use in the food industry. The study shows that consumer actions prove just as important as industrial actions. Recommendations and perspectives Further research is needed to understand the mechanism for the disposal of food, i.e. the reasons for food being wasted, and the relationship between shopping frequency, retail location, size of packaging, etc. in order to reduce the impact of waste and consumer transport.",0
"Given the threatened status of many primate species, the impacts of global warming on primate reproduction and, consequently, population growth should be of concern. We examined relations between climatic variability and birth seasonality, offspring production, and infant sex ratios in two ateline primates, northern muriquis, and woolly monkeys. In both species, the annual birth season was delayed by dry conditions and El Nino years, and delayed birth seasons were linked to lower birth rates. Additionally, increased mean annual temperatures were associated with lower birth rates for northern muriquis. Offspring sex ratios varied with climatic conditions in both species, but in different ways: directly in woolly monkeys and indirectly in northern muriquis. Woolly monkeys displayed an increase in the proportion of males among offspring in association with El Nino events, whereas in northern muriquis, increases in the proportion of males among offspring were associated with delayed onset of the birth season, which itself was related, although weakly, to warm, dry conditions. These results illustrate that global warming, increased drought frequency, and changes in the frequency of El Nino events could limit primate reproductive output, threatening the persistence and recovery of ateline primate populations.",0
"Trends in the seasonal and temporal behaviour of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation over the period 1958-2007 have been assessed using two indices of the phenomenon, NINO3.4 and a non-standardised Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). There is no evidence of trends in the variability or the persistence of the indices, nor in their seasonal patterns. There is a trend towards what might be considered more ""El Nino-like'' behaviour in the SOI (and more weakly in NINO3.4), but only through the period March-September and not in November-February, the season when El Nino and La Nina events typically peak. The trend in the SOI reflects only a trend in Darwin pressures, with no trend in Tahiti pressures. Apart from this trend, the temporal/seasonal nature of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation has been remarkably consistent through a period of strong global warming.",0
"Global climate change will have multiple effects on our environment and might especially change marine coastal ecosystems and their communities due to rising water temperatures and changing light regimes in the water column. Due to the key role of zoospores in the life-history cycle of kelps, we investigated how zoospores of the shallow water species Saccorhiza dermatodea (B. de la Pylaie) J.E. Areschoug respond to interactive effects of changing water temperatures, low/high photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and UV radiation (UVR). Zoospores were examined with respect to germination pattern (germination rates, light micrographs) and phlorotannin content (Folin-Ciocalteu method). In summer 2007, we exposed S. dermatodea zoospores, obtained from fertile thalli in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Norway), to low PAR laboratory [UV-B:UV-A:PAR (W m(-2)) 8:114:100; 2-17 degrees C] and high PAR outdoor experimental conditions [UV-B:UV-A:PAR (W m(-2)) 0.1:5:100; 7 degrees C] for 8 h. Under low PAR+UVR conditions and at 2-12 degrees C, almost 98% of zoospores germinated in all light treatments. The germination rate was reduced under PAR+UV-A+UV-B only in the 17 degrees C and 7 degrees C outdoor treatment, to 24% and 9.6%, respectively. Light microscopic investigations showed differences in germling appearance, growth and pigmentation in the outdoor treatment and at 17 degrees C low PAR conditions, compared with all other treatments, after an exposure time of 8 h. However, phlorotannin content within zoospores remained unaffected by changing UV and low/high PAR conditions. These results suggest that combined effects of present water temperatures, high PAR and UVR can exhibit similar effects on germination as the combined effects of unnatural high temperatures (17 degrees C), low PAR and UVR. With respect to global climate change, the ecological implications of the present study illustrate that zoospores of S. dermatodea are able to survive enhanced water temperatures up to 12 degrees C. Moreover, high PAR in combination with UVR might potentially affect zoospores of S. dermatodea stronger than expected in clear waters.",0
"Atlantic cod Gadus morhua has polymorphic haemoglobin, which can be separated into two homozygous types, HbI-1 and HbI-2, and one heterozygous type HbI-1/2. The geographical distribution of Atlantic cod with the different haemoglobin types varies, with the HbI(2) allele occurring at high frequency in northern regions, and the HbI(1) allele dominant in warmer areas. To determine if temperature is a selective parameter in the distribution of the haemoglobin types, the preferred temperature of the homozygous genotypes HbI-1 and HbI-2 was measured. We found that HbI-2 cod preferred a temperature of 8.2+/-5degreesC while HbI-1 cod preferred 15.4+/-1degreesC, and this preference was significant. The effect of hypoxia (35% oxygen saturation) on the preferred temperature was also measured. Previous studies showed that the preferred temperature of fish decreases during hypoxia, and this was the case for HbI-1 cod, which preferred 9.8+/-8degreesC during hypoxia, whereas HbI-2 cod did not show this effect. The results indicate that environmental temperature changes will lead to a distributional change in the different haemoglobin types of Atlantic cod, global warming providing an advantage for HbI-1 cod. However, since HbI-1 cod prefer a low temperature under hypoxic conditions, a combination of increased water temperature and hypoxia could be unfavourable for Atlantic cod stocks.",0
"Some examples are given to show that the depth distribution curves of natural C-14 and C-13 of thin-layer sampled soil profiles can be used for inferring changes in soil organic matter and climate changes. By using a simple exchange model, we r-an determine whether decomposition products are fixed by clay or transported downward toward the groundwater table. We can also estimate the amount of the Greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4, produced by the decomposition of the organic matter in terrestrial and paddy soils and emitted from the soil. A change from C3 to C4 plants, which might occur during a predicted temperature rise in some areas, thereby influencing the carbon balance, can be clearly detected by the deltaC-13 depth profiles. A change in organic matter input can also be calculated under certain circumstances.",0
"Changes in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and fire regimes have been occurring for decades in the global boreal forest(1-3), with future climate change likely to increase fire frequency(4)-the primary disturbance agent in most boreal forests(3,5). Previous attempts to assess quantitatively the effect of changing environmental conditions on the net boreal forest carbon balance have not taken into account the competition between different vegetation types on a large scale(6-9). Here we use a process model with three competing vascular and non-vascular vegetation types to examine the effects of climate, carbon dioxide concentrations and fire disturbance on net biome production, net primary production and vegetation dominance in 100 Mha of Canadian boreal forest. We find that the carbon balance of this region was driven by changes in fire disturbance from 1948 to 2005. Climate changes affected the variability, but not the mean, of the landscape carbon balance, with precipitation exerting a more significant effect than temperature. We show that more frequent and larger fires in the late twentieth century resulted in deciduous trees and mosses increasing production at the expense of coniferous trees. Our model did not however exhibit the increases in total forest net primary production that have been inferred from satellite data(1,10). We find that poor soil drainage decreased the variability of the landscape carbon balance, which suggests that increased climate and hydrological changes have the potential to affect disproportionately the carbon dynamics of these areas. Overall, we conclude that direct ecophysiological changes resulting from global climate change have not yet been felt in this large boreal region. Variations in the landscape carbon balance and vegetation dominance have so far been driven largely by increases in fire frequency.",0
"Time series (1961-2000) of Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiration estimates for 101 stations on the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding areas are analyzed in this paper. For the Tibetan Plateau as a whole potential evapotranspiration (PET) has decreased in all seasons. The average annual evapotranspiration rate decreased by 13.1 mm/decade or 2.0% of the annual total. Superimposed on this general decline are fluctuations ranging from app. 600 to 700 mm with above average rates in the 1970s and 1980s. On a regional basis, spatial trend distributions remain stable throughout the year with similar seasonal variations. Decreasing PET rates are more pronounced in winter and spring (80% of all stations) as compared to summer and autumn (58% of all stations). Maximum negative (positive) annual rates were recorded at two stations in the southern Qaidam Basin with -79.5 mm/decade (84.8 mm/decade) even though in general negative rates tend to be noticeably higher than positive rates. Changes in wind speed and to a lesser degree relative humidity were found to be the most important meteorological variables affecting PET trends on the Tibetan Plateau while changes in sunshine duration played an insignificant role. Stable daytime temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau have limited the importance of temperature trends for changes of PET rates. Negative evapotranspiration trends are therefore thought to be linked to a general decrease in intensity of the regional monsoon circulation rather than to reductions in sunshine duration. Reduced PET rates appear to be in contrast to a predicted increased hydrological cycle under global warming scenarios.",0
"Towards accounting for the dynamic response of glaciers and ice caps in the estimation of their contribution to sea-level rise due to global warming, a mass-balance degree-day model is coupled to a geometric glacier model. The ice dynamics are treated implicitly in the geometric model by using scaling parameters that have been extensively investigated in the literature. The model is tested by presenting a case-study of the glacier Hintereisferner, Austrian Alps. The results are compatible with geomorphological data and other modelling studies. An estimate is made of the volume decrease due to initial disequilibrium. An extensive sensitivity study using generalized glacier shapes and sizes allows a comparison of results with dynamic theory. According to the geometric model, glaciers with a narrowing channel change more with a change in mass balance than glaciers with a widening channel, due to their shape and the way in which that shape changes with a changing climate. Also their response ti:me is longer. As time progresses after a mass-balance perturbation, the longer response time for continental glaciers compared to glaciers with larger mass turnover offsets the effect of their smaller static sensitivity. Thus, although for the next century we may expect greater changes in volume from alpine glaciers, the equilibrium or committed change is greater for the continental glaciers.",0
"Increased ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation, due to depletion of stratospheric ozone, is an increasing threat to living organisms. Furthermore, increased ground level temperatures as a consequence of global warming may favour development of pathogens, such as Cercospora beticola, that thrive at high temperatures. This study evaluates the effect of combined UV stress and Cercospora leaf-spot disease on young sugarbeet plants (Beta vulgaris L.). An inoculum consisting of twelve European isolates of C, beticola Sacc, was used in the experiments, One Cercospora-sensitive and one Cercospora-tolerant sugarbeet line were analysed from growth regimes where plants were grown either under visible radiation alone or with supplemental UV-B, Photosynthetic pigments and partial reactions of photosynthesis, including potential yield and quantum yield under illumination, non-photochemical quenching (q(NPQ)) and photochemical quenching (q(P)), were measured to assess plant response. The combination of Cercospora a and supplemental UV-B radiation in the sensitive line resulted in a decreased photosynthetic efficiency, shown by q(NPQ) and quantum yield under illumination as compared with that for either stress applied alone. The F(v)/F(m) was unchanged for plants subjected to UV-B radiation without infection, although the q(NPQ) decreased, The Cercospora-tolerant line showed no significant differences under the different treatments, Thus, the line tolerant to Cercospora infection also proved to be tolerant to UV-B radiation alone and in combination with the infection.",0
"Climate change will affect irrigation water demand of rice via changes in rice physiology and phenology, soil water balances, evapotranspiration and effective precipitation. As agriculture is the main sector of water use in Bangladesh, estimation of the agricultural water demand in the changing environment is essential for long-term water resources development and planning. In the present paper, a study has been carried out to estimate the change of irrigation water demand in dry-season Boro rice field in northwest Bangladesh in the context of global climate change. The study shows that there will be no appreciable changes in total irrigation water requirement due to climate change. However, there will be an increase in daily use of water for irrigation. As groundwater is the main source of irrigation in northwest Bangladesh, higher daily pumping rate in dry season may aggravate the situation of groundwater scarcity in the region.",0
"We review how the renormalized force correlator Delta(u), the function computed in the functional renormalization-group (RG) field theory, can be measured directly in numerics and experiments on the dynamics of elastic manifolds in the presence of pinning disorder. We show how this function can be computed analytically for a particle dragged through a one-dimensional random-force landscape. The limit of small velocity allows one to access the critical behavior at the depinning transition. For uncorrelated forces one finds three universality classes, corresponding to the three extreme value statistics, Gumbel, Weibull, and Frechet. For each class we obtain analytically the universal function Delta(u), the corrections to the critical force, and the joint probability distribution of avalanche sizes s and waiting times w. We find P(s)=P(w) for all three cases. All results are checked numerically. For a Brownian force landscape, known as the Alessandro, Beatrice, Bertotti, and Montorsi (ABBM) model, avalanche distributions and Delta(u) can be computed for any velocity. For two-dimensional disorder, we perform large-scale numerical simulations to calculate the renormalized force correlator tensor Delta(ij)(u), and to extract the anisotropic scaling exponents zeta(x)>zeta(y). We also show how the Middleton theorem is violated. Our results are relevant for the record statistics of random sequences with linear trends, as encountered, e.g., in some models of global warming. We give the joint distribution of the time s between two successive records and their difference in value w.",0
"Diesel engines have low specific fuel consumption, but high particulate emissions, mainly soot. Diesel soot is suspected to have significant effects on the health of living beings and might also affect global warming. Hence stringent measures have been put in place in a number of countries and will be even stronger in the near future. Diesel engines require either advanced integrated exhaust after treatment systems or modified engine models to meet the statutory norms. Experimental analysis to study the emission characteristics is a time consuming affair. In such situations, the real picture of engine control can be obtained by the modeling of trend prediction. In this article, an effort has been made to predict emissions smoke and NOx using cylinder combustion derived parameters and diesel particulate filter data, with artificial neural network techniques in MATLAB environment. The model is based on three layer neural network with a back propagation learning algorithm. The training and test data of emissions were collected from experimental set up in the laboratory for different loads. The network is trained to predict the values of emission with training values. Regression analysis between test and predicted value from neural network shows least error. This approach helps in the reduction of the experimentation required to determine the smoke and NOx for the catalyst coated filters.",0
" The first three-dimensional global model in which time-dependent spectral albedos and emissivities over snow and sea ice are predicted with a radiative transfer solution, rather than prescribed, is applied to study the climate response of fossil fuel plus biofuel black carbon plus organic matter (ff+bf BC+OM) when BC absorption in snow and sea ice is accounted for. The model treats the cycling of size-resolved BC+OM between emission and removal by dry deposition and precipitation from first principles. Particles produce and enter size-resolved clouds and precipitation by nucleation scavenging and aerosol-hydrometeor coagulation. Removal brings BC to the surface, where internally and externally mixed BC in snow and sea ice affects albedo and emissivity through radiative transfer. Climate response simulations were run with a ff+bf BC+OC emission inventory lower than that used in a previous study. The 10-year, globally averaged ff+bf BC+OM near-surface temperature response due to all feedbacks was about + 0.27 K (+ 0.32 in the last 3 years), close to those from the previous study ( 5-year average of + 0.3 K and fifth-year warming of + 0.35 K) and its modeled range (+ 0.15 to + 0.5 K) because warming due to soot absorption in snow and sea ice here ( 10-year average of + 0.06 K with a modeled range of + 0.03 to + 0.11 K) offset reduced warming due to lower emission. BC was calculated to reduce snow and sea ice albedo by similar to 0.4% in the global average and 1% in the Northern Hemisphere. The globally averaged modeled BC concentration in snow and sea ice was similar to 5 ng/g; that in rainfall was similar to 22 ng/g. About 98% of BC removal from the atmosphere was due to precipitation; the rest was due to dry deposition. The results here support previous findings that controlling ff+bf BC+OM and CO2 emission may slow global warming.",0
"In October-November 2009, an oceanographic survey was carried out between 50 and 53 degrees S off southern Chile, near the Southern Ice Field. The stations near the glacier showed low temperatures (1-3 degrees C) and salinity (< 25), and high stability (Brunt-Vaisala frequency N > 0.1 cycles s(-1)). Main ichthyoplankton taxa were eggs and larvae of southern sprat Sprattus fuegensis, lightfish Maurolicus parvipinnis, Macrouridae, and southern hake Merluccius australis. The main spawning area of S. fuegensis (similar to 8000 eggs 10 m(-2)) occurred in mixed zones of the adjacent continental shelf, whereas the spawning of M. parvipinnis occurred in intermediate channels associated with medium stability values (N similar to 0.06 cycles s(-1)). Fish egg and larval abundances were null or scarce near the glacier, and the abundance of M. parvipinnis eggs was positively related to the temperature and salinity of the water column, and negatively related to water column stability. Moreover, a negative relationship was observed between seawater density and the diameter of S. fuegensis eggs. The relation between ice melting and ichthyoplankton may have consequences for advective transport and mass mortality of fish eggs and larvae, as well as pelagic-benthic coupling in the Chilean South Patagonia. Global climate change has increased glacier ice melting at high latitudes, and the increased entry of colder, less saline waters in coastal areas may have consequences for the ichthyoplankton in the Chilean Patagonia.",0
"Incubation period., hatching success, and emergence percentage in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests were quantified during the 1993 and 1995 nesting seasons and following incubation seasons in Minabe, Wakayama, Japan. Sand and nest temperatures were also monitored. Over the seasons, daily mean sand temperature at nest depth fluctuated between 18.0degreesC and 33.3degreesC, with a steep increase in the second week of July and a peak in late August. Temperatures inside the nest chambers were a few degrees above those of the surrounding sand at the end of incubation. The incubation period ranged from 46 to 82 days. A significant negative correlation was found between mean sand temperature and incubation period. The relationship conformed to the day-degree concept. There was no significant seasonal trend in hatching success, but many pre-emergent hatchlings were found dead in most of the clutches during the warmest part of the season. Emergence percentage was correlated with mean sand temperature calculated for 4 days before emergence, suggesting that mortality may be due to heat. This heat-related mortality is considered to be a common phenomenon at our study site, because the peak in emergences coincides with the peak in high temperatures. These temperature effects on hatchling mortality must be taken into account in estimates of hatchling sex ratios. Because sand temperatures already exceed the optimal thermal range for incubation, this population is vulnerable to even small temperature increases resulting from global warming.",0
"Infrared spectra recorded by the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy Experiment (ATMOS) and the Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases (IMG) remote sensors have been analyzed by means of line-by-line radiative transfer calculations in order to evaluate the possibilities offered by solar occultation and by nadir instruments to monitor the cholorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their substitutes. The reliability of the existing spectroscopic parameters has been examined, and it was found that only laboratory parameters measured at high resolution reproduce the satellite observations well. It is shown that solar occultation spectra can give information regarding the atmospheric abundance of CFC-113, in addition to the usual retrievals of CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22. Also, relying on existing emission scenarios, it is foreseen that future solar occultation experiments, such as the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment ( ACE), will be able to detect HCFC-142b and HFC-134a, from the year 2005 onward and at low tangent heights. As for the nadir-looking missions, it is found that CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22 can be retrieved from IMG spectra, provided that numerous measurements are averaged over space or time, thereby mitigating the usefulness of such measurements for determining surface sources. The improved geometrical scanning performances of the future nadir-looking Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), however, are shown to be more promising in this respect.",0
"This study focuses on the reproducibility of the climatic change in the early summer rainfall in East Asia (Mei-yu rainband) by the Pseudo Climate Simulation (PCS) using a regional climate model. In the PCS, the lateral boundary condition is given by the composite of six hourly reanalysis data and the difference between two decadal climate means. The daily variation on the lateral boundary of the PCS is similar to that of the control hindcast in one decade, but its climate is the same as the other decadal mean. The PCS accurately reproduces the change in the Mei-yu rainband over Southern China between the 1960s and the 1990s. suggesting that the climatic features of the Mei-yu rainband are controlled by the climatic change in a large-scale circulation. The PCS reduces the uncertainty caused by the interannual variability in case of the downscaling of global warming projected by the General Circulation Models (GCMs) even if the number of sample years is the same as that in the conventional dynamical downscaling. The PCS can also exclude model biases in the present climatology reproduced by each GCM.",0
"Five lagoonal salt marsh areas, ranging from 220 ha to 3,670 ha, were selected from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to the southern DelMarVa peninsula, Virginia, USA to examine the degree to which Spartina marsh area and microhabitats had changed from the early or mid- 1900s to recent periods. We chose areas based on their importance to migratory bird populations, agency concerns about marsh loss and sea-level rise, and availability of historic imagery. We georeferenced and processed aerial photographs from a variety of sources ranging from 1932 to 1994. Of particular interest were changes in total salt marsh area, tidal creeks, tidal flats, tidal and non-tidal ponds, and open water habitats. Nauset Marsh, within Cape Cod National Seashore, experienced an annual marsh loss of 0.40% (19% from 1947 to 1994) with most loss attributed to sand overwash and conversion to open water. At Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in southern New Jersey, annual loss was 0.27% (17% from 1932 to 1995), with nearly equal attribution of loss to open water and tidal pond expansion. At Curlew Bay, Virginia, annual loss was 0.20% (9% from 1949 to 1994) and almost entirely due to perimeter erosion to open water. At Gull Marsh, Virginia, a site chosen because of known erosional losses, we recorded the highest annual loss rate, 0.67% per annum, again almost entirely due to erosional, perimeter loss. In contrast, at the southernmost site, Mockhorn Island Wildlife Management Area, Virginia, there was a net gain of 0.09% per annum (4% from 1949 to 1994), with tidal flats becoming increasingly vegetated. Habitat. implications for waterbirds are considerable; salt marsh specialists such as laughing gulls (Larus atricilla), Forster's terns (Sterna forsteri), black rail, (Laterallus jamaicensis), seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus), and saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) are particularly at risk if these trends continue, and all but the laughing gull are species of concern to state and federal managers.",0
"Background: The leaf is an important plant organ, and how it will respond to future global warming is a question that remains unanswered. The effects of experimental warming on leaf photosynthesis and respiration acclimation has been well studied so far, but relatively little information exists on the structural and biochemical responses to warming. However, such information is very important to better understand the plant responses to global warming. Therefore, we grew Arabidopsis thaliana at the three day/night temperatures of 23/18 degrees C (ambient temperature), 25.5/20.5 degrees C (elevated by 2.5 degrees C) and 28/23 degrees C (elevated by 5 degrees C) to simulate the middle and the upper projected warming expected within the 21st century for this purpose. Results: The 28/23 degrees C treatment significantly reduced the life span, total biomass and total weight of seeds compared with the other two temperatures. Among the three temperature regimes, the concentrations of starch, chlorophyll, and proline were the lowest at 28/23 degrees C, whereas the total weight of seeds, concentrations of chlorophyll and proline, stomatal density (SD), stomatal conductance (g(s)), net CO(2) assimilation rate (A) and transpiration rate (E) were the highest at 25.5/20.5 degrees C. Furthermore, the number of chloroplasts per cell and mitochondrial size were highest at 25.5/20.5 degrees C and lowest at 28/23 degrees C. Conclusions: The conditions whereby the temperature was increased by 2.5 degrees C were advantageous for Arabidopsis. However, a rise of 5 degrees C produced negative effects, suggesting that lower levels of warming may benefit plants, especially those which belong to the same functional group as Arabidopsis, whereas higher levels of warming may produce negative affects. In addition, the increase in A under moderately warm conditions may be attributed to the increase in SD, chlorophyll content, and number of chloroplasts. Furthermore, starch accumulation in chloroplasts may be the main factor influencing chloroplast ultrastructure, and elevated temperature regulates plant respiration by probably affecting mitochondrial size. Finally, high SOD and CAT activities may enable plants grown at elevated temperatures to exhibit relatively high tolerance to temperature stress, thus alleviating the harmful effects of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide.",0
"Water erosion is the most destructive erosion type worldwide, causing serious land degradation and environmental deterioration. Against a background of climate change and accelerated human activities, changes in natural rainfall regimes have taken place and will be expected to become more pronounced in future decades. Long-term shifts may challenge the existing cultivation systems worldwide and eventually alter the spatiotemporal patterns of land use and topography. Meanwhile, specific features of soil crusting/sealing, plant litter and its decomposition, and antecedent soil moisture content (ASMC) will accompany rainfall variability. All these changes will increase pressures on soil erosion and hydrological processes, making accurate erosion prediction and control more difficult. An improved knowledge and understanding of this issue, therefore, is essential for dealing with the forthcoming challenges regarding soil and water conservation practices. In this paper, the characteristics of changes in natural rainfall, its role on terrestrial ecosystems, the challenges, and its effect on surface water erosion dynamics are elaborated and discussed. The major priorities for future research are also highlighted, and it is hoped that this will promote a better understanding of water erosion processes and related hydrological issues.",0
"Global climate change is driving rapid distribution shifts in marine ecosystems; these are well established for lower trophic levels, but are harder to quantify for migratory top predators. By analysing a 25-year sightings-based dataset, we found evidence for rapid northwards range expansion of the critically endangered Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus in northeast Atlantic waters. A 0.6 degrees C sea surface temperature increase in the mid-1990s is interpreted as an underlying controlling factor, while simultaneous northward shifts of plankton and prey fish species suggests a strong bottom-up control. Our results have important conservation implications and provide new evidence for climate-driven regime shift in Atlantic ecosystems.",0
"Current assessments of climate-change effects on ecosystems use two key approaches: (1) empirical synthesis and modeling of species range shifts and life-cycle processes that coincide with recent evidence of climate warming, from which scenarios of ecosystem change are inferred; and (2) experiments examining plant-soil interactions under simulated climate warming. Both kinds of assessment offer indisputable evidence that climate change and its effects on ecosystems are ongoing. However, both approaches often provide conservative estimates of the effects of climate change on ecosystems, because they do not consider the interplay and feedback among higher trophic levels in ecosystems, which may have a large effect on plant species composition and on ecosystem services such as productivity, Understanding the impacts of these top-down processes on ecosystems is critical for determining large-scale ecosystem response to climate change. Using examples of links between climate forcing, trophic interactions, and changes in ecosystem state in selected terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, we show that the ability to understand and accurately forecast future effects of climate change requires an integrated perspective, linking climate and the biotic components of the ecosystem as a whole.",0
"While many numerical studies suggested that large-scale environmental flows significantly affect beta drift, this influence was not verified observationally and included in assessing changes of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks under the background of global warming. This study investigates the influence of large-scale environmental flow on climatologic beta drift in the northern West Pacific using the best track dataset from Joint Typhoon Warming Center (JTWC) and the NCEP monthly reanalysis over the period from 1965 to 2007. Consistent with most previous numerical studies, the meridional shear of zonal wind, vertical shear of zonal wind and meridional gradient of relative vorticity, which are mainly associated with the zonal environmental wind, play an important role in affecting beta drift. For the meridional shear of zonal flows, the northward beta drift in an anticyclonic shear is faster than that in a cyclonic shear. A poleward (equatorward) gradient of relative vorticity leads to faster (slower) westward beta drift than in a resting environment. TCs tend to move to the left of the vector of vertical wind shear.

"No consensus has emerged on the sensitivity of soil respiration to increasing temperatures under global warming due partly to the lack of data and unclear feedbacks. Our objective was to investigate the general trends of warming effects on soil respiration. This study used meta-analysis as a means to synthesize data from eight sites with a total of 140 measurements taken from published studies. The results presented here suggest that average soil respiration in forest ecosystems was increased approximately by 22.5% with escalating soil temperatures while soil moisture was decreased by 16.5%. The decline in soil moisture seemed to be offset by the positive effects of increasing temperatures on soil respiration. Therefore, global warming will tend to increase the release of carbon normally stored within forest soils into the atmosphere due to increased respiration.",0
"Paper pulp manufacturing is the main non-food industrial utilization of plant biomass. Non-wood and agricultural residues are potential raw materials in the production of specialty papers. This chapter aims to quantify the environmental impacts associated with non-wood high quality paper pulp manufacture via soda-anthraquinone (AQ) cooking process by means of the application of LCA methodology in a cradle-to-gate analysis. Hemp (Cannabis sativa) and Flax (Linum usitatissimum) were evaluated as raw materials for the production of high quality non-porous pulp. A specialty paper pulp mill was analysed in detail and process chain was divided in six subsystems: agricultural activities, chemicals production, electricity production, transport, pulp production and waste treatment. Inventory data came from interviews and Surveys (on-site measurements). When necessary, the data were completed with bibliographic resources. Abiotic resources depletion (AD), global warming (GW). ozone layer depletion (OLD), human toxicity (HT), ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidant formation (POF), acidification (A) and eutrophication (E) were the impact categories analysed in this study. According to the results, the environmental impact is mainly caused by the production of chemicals, electricity and fibres (agricultural activities) due to greenhouse gases emissions, phosphorous and nitrogen compounds emissions. The activities inside the pulp mill present minor contribution to almost all impact categories, excluding GW (15%) and E (6%) as well as OLD (25%). This study provides useful information for non-wood based industries related not only to pulp manufacture but also to panels or biorefineries with the aim of increasing their sustainability.

"We coupled an individual-based model of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with a geographic information system (GIS) database to predict climate change effects on southern Appalachian stream populations. The model tracked individuals of both species through the daily processes of spawning, growth, feeding, mortality, and movement for 30 years in a stream reach consisting of connected pools, runs, and riffles. The southern Appalachian Plateau was divided into 101 watershed elevation band zones. Model simulations were performed for a representative stream reach of each stream order in each zone. Trout abundance was estimated by multiplying predicted trout densities (measured in number of trout per meter) by the total length of streams of each order in each watershed elevation zone. Three climate change scenarios were analyzed: temperature only (5-2.5 degreesC warmer stream temperatures); temperature and how (warmer stream temperatures and lower baseline flows with threefold higher peak hows); and temperature, flow, and mortality episodes (warmer stream temperatures, changed hows, and flow-related scouring of redds). Increased temperature alone resulted in increased abundances of brook and rainbow trout. The temperature-and-how scenario resulted in a complex mosaic of positive and negative changes in abundances in zones, but little change in total abundance. Addition of episodic mortality in the form of floods that scour redds and kill eggs and fry caused a net loss of rainbow trout. Predicted changes in habitat (based on simulation results and temperature alone) were, at best, weakly correlated with predicted changes in abundance. The coupling of individual-based models to GIS databases, in order to scale up environmental effects on individuals to regional population responses, offers a promising approach for regional assessments.",0
" Oligotrophic Arctic streams are likely to be sensitive to changes in hydrology and nutrient inputs predicted to occur as a consequence of future climate and land use change. To investigate the potential consequences of nutrient enrichment for low-order Arctic streams, we added ammonium-N and phosphorous to a second-order beaded, tundra stream on Alaska's north slope. We measured responses in nutrient chemistry, chlorophyll a standing crop, and in the breakdown and macroinvertebrate colonisation of leaf litter over a 38-day summer period. 2. During the addition, nutrient concentrations immediately downstream of the dripper averaged 6.4 mum ammonium-N and 0.45 muM soluble reactive P. Concentrations upstream of the dripper averaged 0.54 muM ammonium-N and 0.03 muM soluble reactive P. Uptake of both nutrients was rapid. Concentrations were reduced on average to 28 % (ammonium-N) and 15 % (inorganic P) of maximum values within 1500 m. Standing crops of chlorophyll a on standardised samplers were significantly higher by the end of the experiment. Breakdown rates of senescent willow (Salix sp.) and sedge (Carex sp.) litter and associated fungal biomass were also significantly increased by nutrient addition. 3. Fertilisation resulted in four- to sevenfold higher macroinvertebrate abundance and two-to fourfold higher macroinvertebrate biomass in litter bags, as well as an increase in late-summer body mass of larval Nemoura stoneflies. 4. Our results are consistent with those of similar studies of larger streams in the high-Arctic region. Based on our short-term experiment, increased inputs of nutrients into these ecosystems, whether caused by climate change or more local disturbance, are likely to have profound ecological consequences. Longer-term effects of enrichment, and their interaction with other components of future change in climate or land use, are more difficult to assess.",0
"Model predictions on the response of soil processes to global warming are mostly inferred from small-scale laboratory studies. In this study, a forested catchment in southern Norway was enclosed by a greenhouse and experimentally manipulated by increasing CO2 (+200 mu l l(-1) above ambient) and temperature (+3-5 degrees C). This paper reports on the effects of the climate manipulation on N mineralization and nitrification. We measured net N mineralization and nitrification in a control and treated part of the greenhouse as well as in an uncovered reference catchment in plots dominated by Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull or Vaccinium myrtillus L. Net N mineralization in the 0-10 cm soil layer significantly increased, most likely as a result of increased temperature. The effect was largest in plots dominated by Calluna. Nitrification did not significantly increase. Soil moisture inside the incubated cores was not affected by the climate change treatment. Pre-treatment mineralization was similar inside and outside the enclosure whereas nitrification was higher inside the enclosure. The NH4+ content was significantly lower inside the chamber due to removal of acidifying components from the precipitation and lower inputs of dry deposition. We found however no differences in pH, %C and %N of the LF and H layer and total C and N in the soil cores between the two catchments. Mineralization was generally higher under Vaccinium than under Calluna even though measured soil chemical and physical characteristics were similar. Nitrification was higher under Calluna than under Vaccinium. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Climate changes due to global warming may affect paddy cultivation considerably. Climate changes directly affect rice plant growth, and within paddy cultivation catchments, alter the hydrological regime including flood patterns and water availability for irrigation, and drainage. Although increased atmospheric CO(2) concentrations in the future may enhance plant growth through the CO(2) fertilization effect, impacts of climate change on agriculture are complicated and difficult to predict precisely. This is especially the case for assessing impacts on paddy cultivation, where basin hydrological behavior needs to be understood in detail. Possible adaptations to reduce negative impacts should be tailored to local conditions, which modify climate change impacts on paddy cultivation. In this article, climate change impacts on paddy cultivation are reviewed and a general adaptation strategy is discussed with special reference to the Japanese context.",0
"The Highlands of Madagascar were malaria free until 1878, when a severe epidemic occurred, following the development of irrigated rice farming. Then, the disease became endemic. Between 1949 and 1962, malaria was ""eradicated"" on the Highlands by joint house spraying and chemoprophylaxis measures. The main vector An. funestus disappeared. In 1986-1988, a very severe epidemic with high lethality rate devastated the Highlands. It is now under control. Thanks to the data of a religious dispensary we could follow the evolution of malaria on the Highlands from 1971 to 1995. The number of cases begin to grow in 1975 when the surveillance was neglected. A second step was observed in 1979, when chemoprophylaxis/chemotherapy centres were closed. Then, the increase of malaria became exponential up to 1988. At the time the prevalence had became similar to that of 1948, before the eradication. The epidemic is not due to global warming because the temperature has been stable for the last 30 years. The malaria rise was due the cancellation of control measures. When control was reactivated, the epidemic ceased. In Swaziland Zimbabwe and South Africa, malaria epidemics were also due to control failure. In Uganda Highlands, above 1500 m malaria rise seems linked to the environmental changes, e.g. the cultures which replace papyrus swamp in the valley But malaria did not overcame the altitude of 1900 which it had already reached in 1960. Rainfall should also be considered as a key factor in the epidemics. In the Sahel West Africa, temperature increased from 0,5 degrees C to 01 degrees C degree in the last 25 years, but rainfall decreased from 30 %. As a result, one of the vector; Anopheles funestus disappeared and malaria prevalence dropped by 60 to 80 %. It is not acceptable to predict the future evolution of malaria in taking in account only one parameter : the temperature. The whole factors involved in the epidemiology should be taken into account The predictions based only on the temperature increase (global warming) can be totally wrong if the rainfall, for example decreases.",0
"Little is known about carbon budgets for tropical and subtropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) ecosystems. Information about the Soil CO2 efflux from these ecosystems is particularly scarce, although they have been shown to have special hydrological regimes which might be important in controlling soil respiration. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure soil respiration rates at the Chi-Lan Mountain forest site. The half-hourly dataset was used for analyzing the controlling factors and mechanisms of soil respiration. A manipulation experiment was conducted in the field by applying 3-fold and 1-fold aboveground litter to the soil surface and measuring the respective soil respiration rates using the static alkali chamber method. The results showed that soil respiration rates have a positive exponential correlation with soil temperature and a negative exponential correlation with soil water content. An empirical model relating soil respiration (R-s) to soil temperature (T) and soil water content (theta) is R-s = -0.095 + e(0.88+0.10T-6.99 theta) with R-2 = 0.83. The annual soil respiration rate calculated using this model was 176 g C m(-2) y(-1). This extremely low value might be caused by the permanently high soil moisture and the relative lower mean annual temperature compared to other sites that receive similar amounts of precipitation. The 3-fold and 1-fold litter treatments resulted in significantly higher soil CO2 efflux compared to the chambers with no litter. The magnitude of difference diminished to negligible levels 6 months after treatment. About 10% of the annual soil respiration was contributed by the mineralization of fresh aboveground litter. The carbon mass loss of the decomposing litter during the first 6 months was mainly due to leaching of dissolved organic carbon (75%) and secondarily due to mineralization of CO2. From the results of this study, we hypothesized that the TMCFs may be vulnerable to global warming since the drying of the soil may change the soil from being a carbon sink to being a carbon source, thereby releasing soil organic carbon that had been stored for a long period of time.

"Perfluorocarbons, particularly perfluoroethane (C2F6), are widely used in the semiconductor industry for plasma cleaning of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chambers. Although the quantity Of C2F6 released into the atmosphere by these operations is relatively small, C2F6 is a very powerful greenhouse gas, and methods of reducing atmospheric emissions are being sought. One method is to use a selective membrane to concentrate the C2F6 so that the gas can be condensed on cooling and recovered as a liquid. In the past, similar membrane vapor separation processes used rubbery polymer membranes that permeate the vapor. However, perfluorocarbon vapors have unusually low permeabilities even in rubbery polymers, because of their large size and low solubility. Therefore, glassy polymeric composite membranes were developed to separate and recover C2F6 from CVD chamber exhaust gas. These membranes permeate oxygen and nitrogen, and retain the perfluorocarbon vapor. Membranes with nitrogen/C2F6 selectivities of up to several hundred were made from a number of polymers. A process using these membranes to recover 99% C2F6 from CVD exhaust gas was designed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Considerable behavioural evidence supports harassment by insects as the most important causal link between warm summer temperatures and low body condition of reindeer Rangier tarandus, and that insect activity is influenced by weather condition. However, much less is known about the effect of insect harassment on individual performance, measured as reduced weight gain during summer, and the related consequences on both the reindeer pastoral economy and reindeer as a biological resource. Using climatic data, this paper develops a simple index for the analysis of insect harassment that takes into consideration weather variables known to significantly affect insect activity and/or the level of insect harassment. The insect harassment index, which is based on mid-day ambient temperature greater than or equal to 13 degreesC, wind speed < 6 m/s and cloud cover < 40%, is further used to test the hypothesis that insect harassment has a negative effect on reindeer performance during summer in three Norwegian populations. Results show that harassment by insects negatively affects the autumn weight of reindeer calves, most probably through reduced grazing time and increased energy expenditure, but also indirectly by negatively influencing milk production of the dam. Moreover, female calves were more vulnerable to insect harassment than males. Insect harassment may have consequences on future reproductive performance, calving time, calf birth weight and hence neonatal mortality. and thus affect reindeer productivity. The presented index is easy to estimate and may be used to quantify and compare harassment levels on various reindeer summer grazing areas for management purposes. Our results also suggest that the expected temperature increase in the course of global warming may increase the insect-related stress on reindeer.",0
"Defining the potential implications of global climate change on Mediterranean forest ecosystems requires a basic knowledge on the ecology of fungal pathogens under conditions that would stress host plants. The Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens)-Seiridium spp. pathosystem represents an important case study. In the last century, epidemics of cypress canker have killed historical plantations and the decades-long host resistance will probably break down in the future as a result of both host and pathogen adaptation to increasing temperature and decreasing summer precipitation. In this study, the effect of osmotic water stress on mycelial growth of Seiridium cardinale, S. unicorne and S. cupressi in culture was examined and compared to that of Diplodia cupressi, which is a pathogen of cypress known to be favoured by host water stress. Growth responses were evaluated on potato sucrose agar amended with KCl or NaC1 to give water potentials in the range of -0.34 to -15 MPa. Mycelial growth decreased with decreasing water potential and ceased at -15 MPa, although the mycelium remained alive. Histochemical analysis conducted on S. cardinale grown at -12 MPa revealed melanization and thickening of hyphal walls, in addition to abundance of lipid-rich organelles. These results suggest that the three Seiridium spp. might survive drying cycles in cypress wood, but their tolerance is different. Successful survival strategies may partly result from changes in mycelium structure. Furthermore, S. unicorne was positively stimulated by a water potential of -3 MPa, suggesting that it may have high adaptive potential for life in a drier Mediterranean ecosystem, which is predicted to occur under-scenarios of global warming.",0
"One of the major consequences of global warming is a rise in sea surface temperature which may affect the survival of marine organisms including phytoplankton. Here, we provide experimental evidence for heat-induced cell death in a symbiotic microalga. Shifting Symbiodinium microadriaticum from 27 to 32A degrees C resulted in an increase in mortality, an increase in caspase 3-like activity, and an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production. The caspase-like activity was strongly correlated with the production of NO in thermally challenged microalgae. For this experiment, the application of Ac-DEVD-CHO, a mammalian caspase 3-specific inhibitor, partly prevented (by 65%) the increase in caspase-like activity. To verify the relationship between NO and the caspase-like activity, S. microadriaticum were subsequently incubated with 0 mM of the following chemical NO donors: sodium nitroprusside (SNP), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and 3,3bis(Aminoethyl)-1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1-triazene (NOC-18). The supplementation of both SNP and NOC-18 caused a significant increase in caspase-like activity compared to the control treatment. Pre-treatment of the microalgae with the inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO before the supplementation of the different NO donors completely prevented the increase in caspase-like activity. These results suggest that NO could play a role in the induction of cell death in heat-stressed S. microadriaticum by mediating an increase in caspase-like activity.",0
"Sediment cores from the San Bernardino Cienega near Douglas, Arizona and Agua Prieta, Sonora. Mexico were examined to reconstruct the fire history of this region and inform restoration efforts. A nearly 8000 year vegetation and fire history record was reconstructed from these sediments using fossil pollen and charcoal. Results from the fire reconstruction show an increase in fire activity coincident with the onset of ENSO, and an increase in fire frequency during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Preliminary pollen data show taxa that reflect winter-dominated precipitation (Ephedra and Artemisia) correspond to times of greater fire activity. These fire data shed light on the long-term history of fire in desert environments that may be helpful in understanding what fire regimes may be expected with global warming and also how to best incorporate fire into management plans.

"Increasing levels of environmental stress due to global warming and eutrophication, and concerns about an unparalleled global diversity loss, have triggered new interest in the question whether the stability of ecosystem properties depends on population dynamics of dominant species or on compensatory growth of rare species. Recent meta-analyses suggest that compensatory dynamics are rare in natural systems. Experimental results, however, indicate that the interdependence of stressor regime, species traits, and species richness determines which mechanisms stabilise communities. Stability will depend on population dynamics of dominant species, if they remain the best performers regardless of disturbance. If dominant species become rare or lost, compensatory growth of rare species will insure natural communities against complete failure. Salinity is an important stressor governing growth and distribution of phytoplankton in brackish ecosystems, and its impact on coastal aquatic ecosystems is likely to change due to global warming. We performed two short-term experiments to investigate the effects of salinity stress on community structure and biomass production of natural phytoplankton communities collected in tidally influenced and polymictic Lake Waihola (New Zealand). The lake was brackish when the inoculum for the first experiment was collected. The inoculum for the second experiment originated from a fresh water situation. In both experiments, the phytoplankton assemblage was exposed to a salinity gradient ranging from 0 to 5. To assess the importance of dominance and compensatory growth, we determined biomass production, species richness, diversity, evenness and dominance indices, and species specific growth rates. Biomass production in our experiments was determined by dominant species. Anabaena flos-aquae dominated in the first experiment, and Asterionella formosa in the second experiment. Despite the importance of these species, we found significant growth responses of rare and abundant species. Even if these species showed high growth rates, biomass production was carried by the dominant species as long as the salinity level allowed them to grow. When the salinity level was detrimental to the growth of the dominant species, reduced dominance and increased diversity indices emphasised the importance of compensatory growth of rare species. The salinity stress applied in our experiments was strong enough to change the hierarchy of successful functional traits, which affected community structure and biomass production of the plankton communities. If the predicted sea water rise, increasing frequency of storm tides, rising water temperatures, and altered precipitation and run-off cause the salinity of coastal aquatic ecosystems to change, major changes in community composition, diversity and dominance structure of planktonic primary producers might be expected.

"Current climate change has raised concerns over the fate of the stenothermal Antarctic marine fauna (animals that evolved to live in narrow ranges of cold temperatures). The present paper focuses on Notothenioidei, a taxonomic group that dominates Antarctic fish. Notothenioids evolved in the Southern Ocean over the last 20 million years, providing an example of a marine species flock with unique adaptations to the cold at morphological, physiological and biochemical levels. Their phenotypic modifications are often accompanied by 'irreversible' genomic losses or gene amplifications. On a micro-evolutionary scale, relatively 'shallow' genetic variation is observed, on account of past fluctuations in population size, and a significant genetic structure is evident, suggesting low population connectivity. These features suggest that Antarctic fish might have relatively little potential to adapt to global warming, at least at a genetic level. The extent of their phenotypic plasticity, which is evident to some degree, awaits further research.",0
"Due to the likelihood of global climate change, the frequency and magnitude of natural hazards such as mass movements may likewise change, thus favouring the refinement of methods to detect and quantify geomorphic events when precise records are not available. Geomorphic events typically have a significant effect on tree growth, e.g., reaction wood marked by changes in ring widths and wood density. To date, several dendroecological techniques have been developed to document the occurrence of these events but it rarely has been possible to retrieve additional information from reaction wood concerning the precise kind and intensity of geomorphic events. Additional qualitative information inferred from reaction wood of trees holds the potential to not only document but also estimate important characteristics of natural hazard events. To refine the methods already used in dendrogeornorpology, experiments simulating various geomorphic events were used to monitor subsequent wood anatomical responses of Fagus sylvatica and Alnus glutinosa. The preliminary results indicate that these two common broadleaf tree species show variations in their reactions to different experimental treatments.",0
"Changes in precipitation and soil water availability predicted to accompany global climate change would impact grasslands, where many ecosystem processes are influenced by water availability. Soil biota, including microarthropods, also are affected by soil water content, although little is known about how climate change might affect their abundance and distribution. The goal of this study was to examine soil microarthropod responses to altered soil water availability in tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Two separate experiments were done. The first utilized control and irrigated plots along a topographic gradient to examine the effects of soil water content on microarthropod densities. Microarthropods, mainly Acari, were significantly less abundant in irrigated plots and were generally less abundant at the wetter lowland sites. The second study utilized reciprocal core transplants across an east-west regional precipitation gradient. Large, intact cores were transplanted between a more mesic tallgrass site (Konza Prairie) and a more arid mixed-grass site (Hays) to determine the effects of different soil water regimes on microarthropod abundance and vertical distribution. Data from non-transplanted cores indicated greater total microarthropod densities at the drier Hays site, relative to the wetter Konza Prairie site. Data from the transplanted cores indicated significant effects of location on Acari densities in cores originating from Hays, with higher densities in cores remaining at Hays, relative to those transplanted to Konza. Acari densities in cores originating from Konza were not affected by location; however, oribatid mite densities generally were greater in cores remaining at Konza Prairie. These results confirm the importance of soil water content in affecting microarthropod densities and distributions in grasslands, and suggest complex, non-linear responses to changes in water availability.",0
"Central waters of the North Atlantic are fundamental for ventilation of the upper ocean and are also linked to the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here, we show based on benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios, that during times of enhanced melting from the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) between 9.0-8.5 thousand years before present (ka) the production of central waters weakened the upper AMOC resulting in a cooling over the Northern Hemisphere. Centered at 8.54 +/- 0.2 ka and 8.24 +/- 0.1 ka our dataset records two similar to 150-year cooling events in response to the drainage of Lake Agassiz/Ojibway, indicating early slow-down of the upper AMOC in response to the initial freshwater flux into the subpolar gyre (SPG) followed by a more severe weakening of both the upper and lower branches of the AMOC at 8.2 ka. These results highlight the sensitivity of regional North Atlantic climate change to the strength of central-water overturning and exemplify the impact of both gradual and abrupt freshwater fluxes on eastern SPG surface water convection. In light of the possible future increase in Greenland Ice Sheet melting due to global warming these findings may help us to better constrain and possibly predict future North Atlantic climate change.

"The significant progress made with coupled (atmosphere-ocean) general-circulation models (CGCMs) over the past decade or so is discussed in the context of the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In their first report in 1990, most climate-change GCMs were atmospheric GCMs coupled to 'slab' ocean models and being used only to determine the 'equilibrium' climate response to specified increases in carbon dioxide. The wide range of estimates of their 'climate sensitivity' is discussed, especially in the context of the uncertainty introduced by model sensitivity to representations of cloud. The modelling focus then moved to transient-response, climate-change experiments. These and the related modelling problems are noted; as are the simultaneous growing awareness and improved quantification of a range of natural and human-induced radiative forcings. The consequent inclusion of this information in CGCMs to study the detection and attribution of climate change, leading to the IPCC statement in their 1995 report that 'the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate', is also discussed. A significant modelling breakthrough since the 1995 report is the capability of a few CGCMs to produce stable and realistic climate (control) simulations without using artificial 'flux adjustments'. This is illustrated with results from such a model, the Hadley Centre HadCM3. In conclusion, a brief perspective is given of high-priority modelling developments and applications to be addressed over the next decade.",0
"Common spruce (Picea abies Karst.) is a tree species that occurs naturally in the valleys and other frost sites in high mountain regions, where it is free of serious competition of other tree species. Being resistant to frost, the winter colds of the continental and mountainous climate suit it. It is highly tolerant of winter chills of the continental and mountainous climate, it likes areas with abundant precipitation and snow in particular and avoids those with little precipitation and low relative air humidity. In Croatia, it naturally occurs in high mountain areas of Gorski Kotar, Velebit and other parts of Lika, and especially in frost spots where it is free of competition with other tree species. In Europe, spruce is a favourite tree species for the establishment of forest cultures. It has the properties of both pioneer and transitional tree species. It is highly sensitive to summer droughts. During its growth, in its habitats it creates the conditions for the development of tree species of a climatogenous forest. It develops in regular and uneven-aged stands, while its percentage in selection stands with stable structural and stand conditions is lower. The total growing stock amounts to 13,200,000 m(3), which accounts for 5.57 m(3)/ha of the forested area in Croatia. Its volume share in the highest age and diameter classes is 80%, which indicates its advanced age and physiological weakening. Regular and uneven-aged spruce forests of high silvicultural form cover an area of 6,300 ha, of which spruce accounts for 52% in the composition mixture, silver fir for 35%, common beech for 11%, and other species for 2%. Spruce is currently significantly affected by dieback; at the level of Croatia, the percentage of defoliated crowns is 59.3%, while in the Gorski Kotar area alone it is 96.2%. Droughts are one of the most important factors contributing to the physiological weakening and dieback of spruce in Croatia, while in Europe they are the major cause of dieback of catastrophic proportions. Temperatures measured in the past 15 years are the highest in the 150-year period, with a linear trend of temperature increase amounting to 0.74 degrees C. There is controversy as to the causes of droughts: according to many, they are the consequence of global warming, whereas others disagree. Data are given (Fig. I) on climate change from the past warm period, over the cold one, to the present warm period. Based on average annual temperature deviations for Europe from 1850 to 2009 (Fig. 2), the current warm period has had two cold and three warm sub-periods, which contradicts the frequently emphasised negative impact of man's activity on climate. Apart from extreme droughts, another cause of spruce dieback is attributed to the impact of the unfavourable chemical climate and acid rains arriving most probably from the industrially developed western countries. This is the reason why the lead content in the soils of Gorski Kotar reaches the extreme values of 71 to 128 mg/kg. Accordingly, the unfavourable chemical climate and acid rains are the second most important reason for the dieback of not only spruce but other tree species as well (fir, beech). The third cause of dieback is the artificial and natural expansion of spruce into unsuitable sites, coupled with the absence of timely tending and regeneration procedures in natural and artificially established forest cultures. Spruce cannot be managed with the selection method because it is a pioneer species, which does not regenerate in climatogenic and coherently forested sites. It create the conditions for the return of fir and beech and simultaneously disappears from such stands. Its pioneer properties enable it to expand naturally in all the empty spaces within a broad complex of beech-fir forests in particular, as well as in deforested and degraded forest areas, frost sites, abandoned pastures, meadows, degraded forests such as thickets and scrub and in other areas at higher altitudes. Most of these sites are unsuitable for spruce, causing it to physiologically weaken and decline. Methods of common spruce management used to date have in general not been adjusted to its biological properties and ecological requirements or to the newly created site conditions. In our opinion, in addition to dry periods and unfavourable impact of chemical climate, management methods also represent an important cause of dieback. When all the three causes take place simultaneously, the ensuing result is catastrophic dieback. Low intensity dieback occurring in every stand, including a spruce stand, is a normal phenomenon characteristic of management with natural forests and forest cultures. It is usually the consequence of competition between certain species, particularly because tending operations such as cleaning and thinning are not performed, or it is the reaction to minor local site changes. Spruce is the desirable third species in selection forests of fir and beech, but with a lower percentage share in the composition mix. It creates the conditions for the return of fir and beech to the sites from which they have disappeared for different reasons. With the return of these species, the spruce gradually undergoes physiological weakening and should generally be removed from the composition mix of selection stands by means of tending and regeneration procedures. Spruce is a tree species whose stands have been subjected either to very little tending or none at all. In regular and uneven-aged stands, regeneration procedures have generally been postponed, while in selection stands spruce has been treated like fir in the selection of trees for cutting. All this has led to the currently unfavourable status of spruce: the spruce is old, over-mature, physiologically weak and prone to dieback in all stand forms. In view of the newly created unfavourable climate conditions, as well as air, water and soil pollution, common spruce should not be expanded into inadequate sites beyond its natural distribution range. If established in southern expositions and on stony and shallow soils, it is subject to premature dieback, so timely measures should be taken to replace it with another species that tolerates such conditions. Common spruce is an important, noble and highly usable species and it should not be neglected in future management. Better knowledge should be acquired of its biological properties, ecological requirements and commercial value. These silvicultural-management properties should be fully observed in the application of management procedures.",0
"The lands surrounding the North Atlantic Region (the SCANNET Region) cover a wide range of climate regimes, physical environments and availability of natural resources. Except in the extreme North, they have supported human populations and various cultures since at least the end of the last ice age. However, the region is also important at a wider geographical scale in that it influences the global climate and supports animals that migrate between the Arctic and all the other continents of the world. Climate, environment and land use in the region are changing rapidly and projections suggest that global warming will be amplified there while increasing land use might dramatically reduce the remaining wilderness areas. Because much of the region is sparsely populated-if populated at all-observational records of past environmental changes and their impacts are both few and of short duration. However, it is becoming very important to record the changes that are now in progress, to understand the drivers of these changes, and to predict future consequences of the changes. To facilitate research into understanding impacts of global change on the lands of the North Atlantic Regions, and also to monitor changes in real time, an EU-funded network of research sites and infrastructures was formed in 2000: this was called SCANNET-SCANdinavian/North European NETwork of Terrestrial Field Bases. SCANNET currently consists of 9 core sites and 5 sites within local networks that together cover the broad range of current climate and predicted change in the region. Climate observations are well replicated across the network, whereas each site has tended to select particular environmental and ecological subjects for intensive observation. This provides diversity of both subject coverage and expertise. In this paper, we summarize the findings of SCANNET to-date and outline its information bases in order to increase awareness of data on environmental change in the North Atlantic Region. We also identify important gaps in our understanding and identify where the roles of existing infrastructures and activities represented by SCANNET can facilitate future research, monitoring and ground-truthing activities.",0
"We studied greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in two differently loaded riparian Alnus incana-dominated forests in agricultural landscapes of southern Estonia: a 33-year-old stand in Porijogi, in which the uphill agricultural activities had been abandoned since the middle of the 1990s. and a 50-year-old stand in Viiratsi, which still receives polluted lateral flow from uphill fields fertilized with pig slurry. In Porijogi, closed-chamber based sampling lasted from October 2001 to October 2009, whereas in Viiratsi the sampling period was from November 2003 to October 2009. Both temporal and spatial variations in all GHG gas fluxes were remarkable. Local differences in GHG fluxes between micro-sites (""Edge"", ""Dry"" and ""Wet"" in Porijogi, and ""Wet"", ""Slope"" and ""Dry"" in Viiratsi) were sometimes greater than those between sites. Median values of GHG fluxes from both sites over the whole study period and all microsites did not differ significantly, being 45 and 42 mg CO(2)-C m(-2) h(-1), 8 and 0.5 mu g CH(4)-C m(-2) h(-1), 0 and 2.1 mg N(2)-N m(-2) h(-1), and Sand 9 mu g N(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1), in Porijogi and Viiratsi, respectively. The N(2):N(2)O ratio in Viiratsi (40-1200) was lower than in Porijogi (10-7600). The median values-based estimation of the Global Warming Potential of CH(4) and N(2)O was 19 and 185 kg CO(2) equivalents (eq) ha(-1) yr(-1) in Porijogi and 14 and 336 kg CO(2) eq ha(-1) yr(-1) in Viiratsi, respectively. A significant Spearman rank correlation was found between the mean monthly air temperature and CO(2), CH(4) and N(2) fluxes in Porijogi, and N(2)O flux in Viiratsi, and between the monthly precipitation and CH(4) fluxes in both study sites. Higher groundwater level significantly increases CH(4) emission and decreases CO(2) and N(2)O emission, whereas higher soil temperature significantly increases N(2)O, CH(4) and N(2) emission values. In Porijogi, GHG emissions did not display any discernable trend, whereas in Viiratsi a significant increase in CO(2), N(2), and N(2)O emissions has been found. This may be a result of the age of the grey alder stand, but may also be caused by the long-term nutrient load of this riparian alder stand, which indicates a need for the management of similar heavily loaded riparian alder stands.

"The oceans have a major influence on climate through the ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. However, limits to our present understanding of some of these processes is an important factor in our inability to model climate change precisely. Present knowledge of ocean structure and circulation is reviewed, with a particular emphasis on the Southern Hemisphere oceans, and the major ocean-atmosphere exchanges are examined. The influence of interhemispheric asymmetries in global warming scenarios is discussed. An improved understanding of the oceans and therefore better climate models will result from planned international ocean research experiments in the 1990s.",0
"A central but little-tested prediction of ""escape and radiation'' coevolution is that colonization of novel, chemically defended host plant clades accelerates insect herbivore diversification. That theory, in turn, exemplifies one side of a broader debate about the relative influence on clade dynamics of intrinsic (biotic) vs. extrinsic (physical-environmental) forces. Here, we use a fossil-calibrated molecular chronogram to compare the effects of a major biotic factor (repeated shift to a chemically divergent host plant clade) and a major abiotic factor (global climate change) on the macroevolutionary dynamics of a large Cenozoic radiation of phytophagous insects, the leaf-mining fly genus Phytomyza (Diptera: Agromyzidae). We find one of the first statistically supported examples of consistently elevated net diversification accompanying shift to new plant clades. In contrast, we detect no significant direct effect on diversification of major global climate events in the early and late Oligocene. The broader paleoclimatic context strongly suggests, however, that climate change has at times had a strong indirect influence through its effect on the biotic environment. Repeated rapid Miocene radiation of these flies on temperate herbaceous asterids closely corresponds to the dramatic, climate-driven expansion of seasonal, open habitats.",0
"A region of western Siberia is vulnerable to the predicted climatic change which may induce an important modification to the carbon balance in wetland ecosystems. This study focuses on the evaluation of both the long-term and contemporary trends of peat (carbon) accumulation and its patterns at the southern climatic range of Sphagnum peatlands in western Siberia. Visible and physical features of peat and detailed reconstructions of successional change (or sediment stratigraphies) were analysed at two types of forest -peatland ecotones, which are situated close to each other but differ by topography and composition of their plant communities. Our results suggest that Siberian peatlands exhibit a general trend towards being a carbon sink rather than a source even at or near the southern limit of their distribution. Furthermore, two types of peat accumulation were detected in the study area, namely persistent and intermittent. As opposed to persistent peat accumulation, the intermittent one is characterized by the recurrent degradation of the upper peat layers at the marginal parts of raised bogs. Persistent peat accumulation is the case for the majority of Sphagnum peatlands under current climatic conditions. It might be assumed that more peat will accumulate under the ' increased precipitation' scenarios of global warming, although intermittent peat accumulation could result in the eventual drying that may change peatlands from carbon sinks to carbon sources.",0
"Recent concerns about global warming have resulted in more concerted studies on quantification and modeling of carbon (C) storage in different ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess and map the carbon stocks in above (ABG), below-ground (BLG) biomass and soil organic carbon contained in the 30 centimeter top-layer (SOC) in coppices of eucalyptus plantations in the central highlands of Madagascar in an area of 1590 ha. Relationships between C stock and various biophysical (stool or shoot stockings and ages, circumferences) and spatial (elevation, slope, and soil type) factors that may affect C storage within each pool were investigated. Three different modeling techniques were tested and compared for various factor sets: (i) simple linear regression (SLM), (ii) multiple linear (MLM) models and, (iii) boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Weights of the factors in the respective model were analyzed for the three pool-specific models that produced the highest accuracy measurement. A regional spatial prediction of carbon stocks was performed using spatial layers derived from a digital elevation model, remote sensing imagery and expert knowledge. Results showed that BRT had the best predictive capacity for C stocks compared with the linear regression models. Elevation and slope were found to be the most relevant predictors for modeling C stock in each pool, and mainly for the SOC. A factor representing circumferences of stools and their stocking (stools.ha(-1)) largely influenced BLG. Shoot circumference at breast height and shoot age were the best factors for ABG fitting. Accuracy assessment carried out using coefficient of determination (R-2) and ratio of standard deviation to prediction error (RPD) showed satisfactory results, with 0.74 and 95 for AGB, 0.85 and 2.59 for BLG, and 0.61 and 6 for SOC respectively. Application of the best fitted models with spatial explanatory factors allowed to map and estimate C contained within each pool : 32 +/- 13 Gg C for ABG, 67 +/- 15 Gg C for BLG and, 139 +/- 36 Gg C for SOC (1 Gg=10(9) g). A total of 238 +/- 40 Gg C was obtained for the entire study area by combining the three C maps. Despite their relatively low predictive quality, models and C maps produced herein provided relevant reference values of C storage under plantation ecosystems in Madagascar. This study contributed to the reducing of uncertainty related to C monitoring and baseline definition in managed terrestrial ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"The extent of ice in the Nordic Seas measured in April has decreased by similar to 33% over the past 135 yr. Retrospective comparison indicates that the recent decrease in the ice extent is within the range of variability observed since the eighteenth century. Temporal, monotonically reduced extreme events occur with intervals of 12-14 yr, suggesting that series longer than similar to 30 yr should be considered to obtain statistical significance regarding temporal changes. Otherwise, decadal temperature variation is also found in the northbound warmer ocean currents. The temperature in the upper layers of these currents seems moreover to have increased by the order of 1 degreesC since the cooling during the Little Ice Age. This temperature increase accounts for most of the ice extent reduction since similar to 1860. A strong negative correlation is found between the larger North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) winter index and the Nordic Seas April ice extent, and a corresponding positive correlation is observed for the Newfoundland-Labrador Sea. It is not until the warming of the Arctic, 1905-30, that the NAO winter index shows repeated positive values over a number of sequential years, corresponding to repeated northward fluxes of warmer air over the Nordic Seas during the winter. An analog repetition of southward fluxes of colder air during wintertime occurs during the cooling period in the 1960s. Concurrently, the temperature in the ocean surface layers was lower than normal during the warming event and higher than normal during the cooling event. Northward atmospheric winter fluxes are observed after the enhanced global warming after similar to 1970, and, for the first time over the period considered, a positive correlation is observed between atmospheric and oceanic reducing effects on the ice extent. The enhanced global warming over the past two decades seems also to be manifest in an intensified winter circulation at higher latitudes, rather than a contemporary change in the Arctic Ocean surface temperature.",0
"A clocbe design is described that is suitable for elevating temperature to simulate global warming in polar ecosystems. This cloche system was used in a manipulation experiment near Ny Alesund, Spitsbergen, Svalbard. An average warming of 2.8 deg.

The elevation effect is shown to be consistent over the diel cycle and throughout the short arctic summer season. Several advantages over previous designs of manipulation unit are highlighted.",0
"Background: Recent reports from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) suggested that invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades may quickly spread into many parts of the U. S. due to putative climatic suitability. Additionally, projected trends of global warming were predicted to significantly increase suitable habitat and promote range expansion by these snakes. However, the ecological limitations of the Burmese python are not known and the possible effects of global warming on the potential expansion of the species are also unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that a predicted continental expansion is unlikely based on the ecology of the organism and the climate of the U. S. Our ecological niche models, which include variables representing climatic extremes as well as averages, indicate that the only suitable habitat in the U. S. for Burmese pythons presently occurs in southern Florida and in extreme southern Texas. Models based on the current distribution of the snake predict suitable habitat in essentially the only region in which the snakes are found in the U. S. Future climate models based on global warming forecasts actually indicate a significant contraction in suitable habitat for Burmese pythons in the U. S. as well as in their native range. Conclusions/Significance: The Burmese python is strongly limited to the small area of suitable environmental conditions in the United States it currently inhabits due to the ecological niche preferences of the snake. The ability of the Burmese python to expand further into the U. S. is severely limited by ecological constraints. Global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the area of suitable habitat worldwide, underscoring the potential negative effects of climate change for many species.",0
"'Venice is sinking while the sea level is rising' is a common statement in issues concerning the future of the Venice lagoon. The search for a reliable interpretative tool for measured sea-level changes has taken on more urgency since the sea-level rise was indexed as the consequence of global warming-with catastrophic scenarios for both the ecotone and the city, linked to increasing lagoon erosion, sudden modifications of biological equilibriums, loss of wetlands, salt aggression and an increasing frequency of exceptional high tide events. However, the peculiar hydrodynamics of the northern Adriatic Sea, made more complex by the freshwater inflow from the Po River, and the conceptual limits of existing long-term predictive systems, would suggest a more cautious approach to the scenarios yet proposed for the next century.",0
"More than a decade has passed since the International Panel on Climatic Change began to study (in depth) the possibility that the global climate was changing. Increasing attention is also being paid to the impact of such changes on society in general, and on the planning and management of water resources. Not least among the water resources planning problems is the estimation of the changes which might occur in public water-supply demands. Such changes are notoriously difficult to evaluate, particularly in the UK where most domestic premises remain un-metered. Elsewhere, econometric models involving climatic parameters as independent variables have had some success, but a recent application of this approach in the UK was unable to identify particular parameters which had a consistent influence over the summer period. This lack of success might be partly caused by the public reaction to summer conditions being a complex function of several parameters, such as duration of sunshine, temperature and rainfall. This complexity has already been recognised by climatologists, who have devised forms of summer indices involving weighted combinations of climatic variables to determine how 'good' or 'bad' a particular period might be perceived by the general public. The use of one such summer index to explain the variations in an index of demand for public water supply in the London supply area has shown that simple and consistent relationships can be derived. Application of these relationships to scenarios of changes in temperature, sunshine duration and rainfall totals for the year 2050 shows an increase of 0.6- 2.9 index points in water-supply demand over the 1950-1990 period average.",0
"Understanding terrestrial carbon metabolism is critical because terrestrial ecosystems play a major role in the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, humans have severely disrupted the carbon cycle in ways that will alter the climate system and directly affect terrestrial metabolism. Changes in terrestrial metabolism may well be as important an indicator of global change as the changing temperature signal. Improving our understanding of the carbon cycle at various spatial and temporal scales will require the integration of multiple, complementary and independent methods that are used by different research communities. Tools such as air sampling networks, inverse numerical methods, and satellite data (top-down approaches) allow us to study the strength and location of the global- and continental-scale carbon sources and sinks. Bottom-up studies provide estimates of carbon fluxes at finer spatial scales and examine the mechanisms that control fluxes at the ecosystem, landscape, and regional scales. Bottom-up approaches include comparative and process studies (for example, ecosystem manipulative experiments) that provide the necessary mechanistic information to develop and validate terrestrial biospheric models. An iteration and reiteration of top-down and bottom-up approaches will be necessary to help constrain measurements at various scales. We propose a major international effort to coordinate and lead research programs of global scope of the carbon cycle.",0
"In the current context of global deforestation and global warming, a wide range of organisations, with local to international remits, need estimates of forest biomass to assess the state of the World's forests and their rate of change. The task would be impossible without space-based Earth observation, which allows the rapid generation of extensive data sets describing land surface properties. It is the task of remote sensing scientists to interpret these data into a meaningful source of forest information. Here, a fast and easily automated method for classifying boreal forests in terms of growing stock volume is presented. The work was conducted as part of the SIBERIA project, which has resulted in the recent publication of a map of forest growing stock volume covering 2 900 000 km(2) in Central Siberia. The paper describes the use of satellite-based radar coherence to differentiate categories of forest growing stock volume, the application of this method to classify and map Central Siberian forests, and the characterisation of the forest classes to help in the interpretation.

"Lidar is being widely used to monitor meteorological parameters and atmospheric constituents. Applications include meteorology, environmental pollution, atmospheric dynamics and global climate change. Signal processing for lidar applications involve highly nonlinear models and consequently nonlinear filtering. In this paper, we applied a new method, empirical mode decomposition to the lidar signal processing. The denoising approach is done by removal of the proper intrinsic mode functions. The data from the simulation and measurements are analyzed to evaluate this method comparing with the traditional low-pass filter and the multi-pulse averaging. Results show that it is effective-and superior to the band-pass filter and the averaging method. The denoising method also allows less averaging laser shots which is important for the real-time monitoring and for the low cost laser transmitter. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
Continental flood basalt (CFB) volcanism is hypothesized to have played a causative role in global climate change and mass extinctions. Uncertainties associated with radiometric dating preclude a clear chronological assessment of the environmental consequences of CFB volcanism. Our results document a 25% decline in the marine Os-187/Os-188 record that predates the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (KTB) and coincides with late Maastrichtian warming. We argue that this decline provides a chemostratigraphic marker of Deccan volcanism and thus constitutes compelling evidence that the main environmental consequence of Deccan volcanism was a transient global warming event of 3degrees to 5degreesC that is fully resolved from the KTB mass extinction.,0
"Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, largely due to burning of fossil fuels, may accentuate the risk of global warming. Scientists are optimistic that with appropriate management soils can function as sinks for C and contribute to CO2 abatement strategies. The objective of this study was to determine if soil C can be increased using an annual legume green manure (GM) as partial fallow replacement in a fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-wheat (F-W-W) rotation in the Brown soil zone of Saskatchewan. In 1995 and 1996 we measured soil C fluxes in all phases of F-WW and GM-W-W rotations, which were two of the treatments in an experiment initiated in 1987 on a medium-textured Orthic Brown Chernozem. The GM, Indianhead black lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) was estimated to add 1800 and 1400 kg C ha(-1) in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Annual inputs of C in residues of the wheat crops were two to three times those of GM. Comparison of CO2 emissions from GM with those from the fallow phase of the F-W-W system suggested that GM largely decomposed in the interval between incorporation (mid-July) and freeze-up in fall. Fluxes of CO2 from the wheat phases of GM-W-W closely matched those from the corresponding phases of F-W-W, confirming that there was little carryover of undecomposed GM to the following growing season. Our results suggest that, in a 3-yr rotation, partial fallow replacement with legume GM may have only a minor impact on C sequestration because the increase in C inputs is relatively small (similar to 25% in this study) and GM decomposes rapidly in the soil due to its narrow C:N ratio (12-13). Green manuring may, however, play a more significant role in enhancing soil C levels in a F-W system, where relatively large increases in C inputs could be achieved using currently-available legume species.",0
"Stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions to stem the impact of global climate change is becoming one of the hottest topics heading into the new century. Regardless of which side of the issue you are on, there is no debate that increasing energy efficiency is important to environmental preservation. One of the most effective energy efficient technologies available is mineral fiber insulation. The examples presented will give energy management professionals the evidence they need to consider industrial insulation a time-tested, off-the-shelf technology for achieving major reductions in operating costs and CO2 emissions.",0
This paper proposes a general systems theory for fractals visualising the emergence of successively larger scale fluctuations resulting from the space-time integration of enclosed smaller scale fluctuations. Global gridded time series data sets of monthly mean temperatures for the period 1880 2007/2008 are analysed to show that data sets and corresponding power spectra exhibit distributions close to the model predicted inverse power law distribution. The model predicted and observed universal spectrum for interannual variability rules out linear secular trends in global monthly mean temperatures. Global warming results in intensification of fluctuations of all scales and manifested immediately in high frequency fluctuations.,0
"Global warming is presently a widely accepted phenomenon with a broad range of anticipated impacts on marine ecosystems. Alterations in temperature, circulation and ice cover in Arctic seas may result in changes in food chain dynamics, beginning with planktonic processes. As part of the Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI) program, we conducted zooplankton surveys during summer 2002 to assess the biomass, distribution and abundance of copepods and other pelagic zooplankton over the Chukchi and Beaufort shelves, slope regions and the adjacent Canada Basin. The motivation for our fieldwork was the question, ""Will global change, particularly warming, result in more large-sized zooplankton which support a pelagic food web of fish, birds, and certain mammals over the Chukchi and Beaufort shelves or in more smaller-sized zooplankton which will diminish the fish, birds and mammals and favor sedentary benthic organisms?"" The objectives of the present study were 1) to census the regional zooplankton community and establish a baseline for comparisons with historical and future studies and 2) to determine whether large-bodied copepods associated with deep waters of the Bering Sea or the Canada Basin were transported to the shelves in sufficient numbers to modify the food web in a region where smaller copepods often dominate the zooplankton numerically. Spatial distributions of zooplankton communities were clearly associated with hydrographic habitats determined by the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of the upper water layer. Smaller taxa dominated the shelf communities while offshore zooplankton assemblages were characterized by large-bodied copepods. The mesozooplankton community was numerically dominated by copepod nauplii and small-bodied juveniles, including Pseudocalanus spp. and Oithona similis. We observed very few large-bodied copepods from the Bering Sea. However, much of the shelf region surveyed included relatively numerous Calanus glacialis juveniles and adults, suggesting that these copepods were advected onto the shelf and possibly reproducing there. Juvenile stages of the large-bodied copepod Calanus hyperboreus were found in relative abundance on the Chukchi shelf in the vicinity of Hanna Canyon. These observations suggest that large-bodied, deep-water species from the basin are advected onto the Chukchi Shelf where they may impact the fate of shelf-derived primary production and alter the food webs of the shelves. Regional comparisons of abundances of selected taxa enumerated in the present study with sample data from the early 1950s suggested that some taxa were more abundant in the SBI region in 2002 than ca. 50 years ago. Long-tern changes in planktonic populations are expected to have significant implications for shelf-basin exchange of biogenic material in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and the adjacent Arctic Basin.

"It is argued that standard environmental economic and 'ecological economics', have the same fundamentals of valuation in terms of money, based on a demand curve derived from utility maximization. But this approach leads to three different measures of value. An invariant measure of value exists only if the consumer has 'homothetic preferences'. In order to obtain a numerical estimate of value, specific functional forms are necessary, but typically these estimates do not converge. This is due to the fact that the underlying economic model is not structurally stable. According to neoclassical economics, any environmental remediation can be justified only in terms of increases in consumer satisfaction, balancing marginal gains against marginal costs. It is not surprising that the optimal policy obtained from this approach suggests only small reductions in greenhouse gases. We show that a unidimensional metric of consumer's utility measured in dollar terms can only trivialize the problem of global climate change.",0
"A comprehensive biogeochemistry model, DNDC, was revised to simulate crop growth and soil processes more explicitly and improve its ability to estimate methane (CH(4)) emission from rice paddy fields under a wide range of climatic and agronomic conditions. The revised model simulates rice growth by tracking photosynthesis, respiration, C allocation, tillering, and release of organic C and O(2) from roots. For anaerobic soil processes, it quantifies the production of electron donors [H(2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] by decomposition and rice root exudation, and simulates CH(4) production and other reductive reactions based on the availability of electron donors and acceptors (NO(3)(-), Mn(4)(+), Fe(3)(+), and SO(4)(2-)). Methane emission through rice is simulated by a diffusion routine based on the conductance of tillers and the CH(4) concentration in soil water. The revised DNDC was tested against observations at three rice paddy sites in Japan and China with varying rice residue management and fertilization, and produced estimates consistent with observations for the variation in CH(4) emission as a function of residue management. It also successfully predicted the negative effect of (NH(4))(2)SO(4) on CH(4) emission, which the current model missed. Predicted CH(4) emission was highly sensitive to the content of reducible soil Fe(3+) which is the dominant electron acceptor in anaerobic soils. The revised DNDC generally gave acceptable predictions of seasonal CH(4) emission, but not of daily CH(4) fluxes, suggesting the model's immaturity in describing soil heterogeneity or rice cultivar-specific characteristics of CH(4) transport. It also overestimated CH(4) emission at one site in a year with low temperatures, suggesting uncertainty in root biomass estimates due to the model's failure to consider the temperature dependence of leaf area development. Nevertheless, the revised DNDC explicitly reflects the effects of soil electron donors and acceptors, and can be used to quantitatively estimate CH(4) emissions from rice fields under a range of conditions.",0
"The thermal convection of fluid inside ballast layer and ripped-rock layer, which are regarded as porous media in railway embankment, is the process of heat and mass transfer. In this paper, in order to research the influence of different embankment structures and geometries on the underlying permafrost thermal regime along Qinghai-Tibetan Railway, a numerical representation of the unsteady two-dimensional continuity, momentum (non-Darcy) and energy equations of thermal convection for incompressible fluid in porous media is used to analyze temperature characteristics of a traditional ballast embankment, a horizontal ripped-rock embankment and two U-shaped ripped-rock embankments for the 50 years. The calculated results indicate: (1) the traditional ballast embankment will cause the great degradation of the underlying permafrost under the assumption that the air temperature will warm up 2.6 degrees C in the 50 years; (2) the U-shaped ripped-rock embankment with 150 cm-thick ripped-rock layer and 160-cm-wide ripped-rock revetment can efficiently protect the underlying permafrost. However, 120-cm-thick horizontal ripped-rock layer has weak cooling effect. Therefore, the horizontal ripped-rock layer thickness is a very important factor to the effect of ripped-rock embankment. These analyses indicate that reasonable ripped-rock embankment structure and embankment geometry can provide an effective mechanism for preserving permafrost under trend of global warming and avoiding large deformation and embankment failure due to thaw settlement in high-temperature permafrost regions along Qinghai-Tibetan Railway.

"Aim To identify the effect of climate change on selected plant species representative of the main vegetation types in the Faroe Islands. Due to a possible weakening of the North Atlantic Current, it is difficult to predict whether the climate in the Faroe Islands will be warmer or colder as a result of global warming. Therefore, two scenarios are proposed. The first scenario assumes an increase in summer and winter temperature of 2 degreesC, and the second a decrease in summer and winter temperature of 2 degreesC. Location Temperate, low alpine and alpine areas in the northern and central part of the Faroe Islands. Methods The responses of 12 different plant species in the Faroe Islands were tested against measured soil temperature, expressed as T-min, T-max, snow cover and growing degree days (GDD), using generalised linear modelling (GLM). Results The tolerance to changes in winter soil temperature (0.3-0.8 degreesC) was found to be lower than the tolerance to changing summer soil temperature (0.7-0 degreesC), and in both cases lower than the predicted climate changes. Conclusions The species most affected by a warming scenario are those that are found with a limited distribution restricted to the uppermost parts of the mountains, especially Salix herbacea, Racomitrium fasciculare, and Bistorta vivipara. For other species, the effect will mainly be a general upward migration. The most vulnerable species are those with a low tolerance, especially Calluna vulgaris, and also Empetrum nigrum, and Nardus stricta. If the climate in the Faroe Islands should become colder, the most vulnerable species are those at low altitudes. A significantly lower temperature would be expected to produce a serious reduction in the extent of Vaccinium myrtillus and Galium saxatilis. Species like Empetrum nigrum, Nardus stricta, and Calluna vulgaris may also be vulnerable. In any case, these species can be expected to migrate downwards.",0
"The Canadian horticultural peat industry generates carbon emissions through various methods of peat extraction, processing, and land-use changes. This study provides a carbon emissions analysis comparing the traditional vacuum harvest (VH) and block-cut (BC) extraction techniques to a new acrotelm transplant (AT) method that restores natural peatland function by preserving and replacing the surface layer vegetation as part of the extraction process. The relative global warming potential for each extraction method was determined by estimating carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane exchange for each phase of peat extraction, including emissions from land-use change and machinery fuel consumption. Preliminary findings, based on 1 y of measurements, indicate that the AT technique has the lowest annual carbon emissions compared to the VH and BC methods. Projected total carbon emissions from a 75-ha peatland after 50 y of extraction using the AT technique produced a sink of approximately 3300 t CO(2) equivalents (CO(2)-e). This represents a marked reduction in total carbon emissions estimated for the VH (19 000 t CO(2)-e) and BC (29 000 t CO(2)-e) extraction techniques. This analysis suggests that the AT method reestablishes peat accumulation and peatland carbon storage function more effectively than the VH and BC methods, which are associated with delayed restoration efforts. Consequently, the AT technique has the potential to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the Canadian horticultural peat industry.",0
"A technique for monitoring the strong, vortex wind field is much required with the rapid increase in global warming. For the realization of the technique, the acoustic tomography of two-dimensional vortex air flow profile was proposed. which can be reconstructed by arraying approximately 10 pairs of transmitters and receivers in parallel. To show the feasibility of the present method, experimental results of performance evaluation using an indoor simulation system are presented. In particular, the reproducibilities of time and space variations of the vortex wind fields passing through the monitoring region were examined. To achieve the real-time capability, a correction scheme for the error caused by the time lag in the sequential sampling was introduced. As a result. Vortex wind Velocity fields could be reconstructed with a hi,,h-speed frame rate while keeping a satisfactory tractability against time and space vortex wind field variations.

"In recent years, global warming concerns have focused attention on cloud radiative forcing and its accurate encapsulation in radiative transfer measurement and modeling programs. At present, this process is constrained by the dynamic movement and inhomogeneity of cloud structure. This study attempts to quantify the UV sky radiance distribution induced by a partial and overcast stratiform cloud field while addressing some of the inherent spatial and temporal errors resulting from cloud. For this purpose, high-quality azimuthally averaged 2-min measurements of erythemal UV-B sky radiance distribution were undertaken by a variable sky-view platform at Hobart, Australia (42.90degreesS, 147.33degreesE). Measurements were subsequently compared with Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations using both a multifractal and plane-parallel homogenous (PPH) cloud field. Data were also compared with several empirical parameterizations. Results at solar zenith angles of 30degrees and 50degrees show that for overcast conditions, the multifractal model is superior to the PPH model. For broken cloud conditions, the radiance measurements are biased toward higher instances of direct-beam interruption by cloud. This tends to smooth the near-sun sky radiance field whereas the multifractal model under the same conditions continues to exhibit the circumsolar effect, indicating that its performance may be still valid for radiation modeling. An empirical parameterization of the same multifractal model produced similar sky radiance profiles, warranting its use in radiative transfer models.",0
"Although scientists have warned of possible social perils resulting from climate change, the impacts of long-term climate change on social unrest and population collapse have not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, high-resolution paleo-climatic data have been used to explore at a macroscale the effects of climate change on the outbreak of war and population decline in the preindustrial era. We show that long-term fluctuations of war frequency and population changes followed the cycles of temperature change. Further analyses show that cooling impeded agricultural production, which brought about a series of serious social problems, including price inflation, then successively war outbreak, famine, and population decline successively. The findings suggest that worldwide and synchronistic war-peace, population, and price cycles in recent centuries have been driven mainly by long-term climate change. The findings also imply that social mechanisms that might mitigate the impact of climate change were not significantly effective during the study period. Climate change may thus have played a more important role and imposed a wider ranging effect on human civilization than has so far been suggested. Findings of this research may lend an additional dimension to the classic concepts of Malthusianism and Darwinism.",0
"The purpose of the study was to estimate among- and within-population variation for juvenile growth and for growth rhythm traits, bud flushing and leaf colouring, in open-pollinated families of Quercus robur L. from six Lithuanian populations under different environmental conditions. Assessments were done in the nursery up to 4 yrs, and after replanting in three field trials at the age of 6 yrs. A highly significant population effect was found for bud flushing. Large family variance components were estimated for bud flushing and height. The familyxsite interaction was significant and more pronounced for growth cessation and height than for bud flushing. Depending on the trait, from 13 to 33% of families contributed significantly to the familyxsite interaction. Strongly significant sitexpopulation interaction was estimated only for bud flushing. Families with early bud flushing were taller, although the correlation was weak. Correlations between family means in bud flushing and bud flushing of parent trees varied from 0.53 to 0.60. Large CV A estimates for the adaptive traits suggest that species have a potential to adapt to environmental changes that may occur from global warming and indicate good perspectives for gene conservation and tree breeding when using Multiple Population Breeding System.",0
"We review the current evidence that changes in arrival and departure dates of migratory birds have taken place, and the relationship of these changes to climate variability. There is little doubt that the timing of spring migration closely follows weather variations. This is more evident and/or stronger in short-distance migrants than in long-distance migrants, but the latter have also responded to climate change. Changes of spring arrival in birds depend on climate impacts at different latitudes along the route from wintering to breeding areas. Therefore, also migratory strategy, e.g., stopover tactics and migratory routes, may be under selective forces due to climate change. Changes in breeding environment depend on the climate there. The discrepancy between en route and breeding time impacts can induce poor fit between annual cycles of birds and their resources. Changes of timing of autumn migration are more variable and they are less well understood. Some species have advanced and others postponed their autumn migration. As long as seasonal variation of environmental constraints at species level remains elusive we cannot predict which species will delay autumn departure and which will advance it in synchrony with spring events. The net result of changes of phenology has often been the lengthening of the summer part of the annual cycle. Because the first analyses of changes of both migration periods and time span between them are based on bird station data, it is still too early to generalise this variation against ecological traits of species. Lengthening of time spent in the breeding area may relax some time constraints set by seasonality by allowing more time to breed and moult, but just the opposite is also possible depending on latitude and temperature regime at which changes are taking place.",0
"The present study analyzed the impact of earlier rice phenology as a result of climate change on the risk of cold damage during reproductive growth using the historical temperature record from 1961 to 2010 at four locations in northern Japan. During this period, heading date has become 0.7-9 days earlier per 10 years. Air temperatures during the booting stage (6-15 days before heading) decreased by 0.18 degrees C per 10 years even though the air temperature on a given calendar date has increased slightly. The estimated potential yield losses caused by cold damage have increased since the start of the study period. Thus, the advance in phonological events as a result of global warming is likely to increase the risk of future yield losses, and this has important implications for future adaptation strategies (breeding new cultivars and changing crop management strategies) to reduce the risk of cold damage.

"Herring caught in the Thames Estuary sustain a small local commercial fishery (peak catch of 606 t during the 1972-1973 fishing season). Loss of local consumers' interest in the herring product has resulted in a gradual decline in catches and fishing effort for the stock. The stock is assessed using an age-structured model that relies on the information provided by a scientific trawl survey, and management advice is provided before the fishing season starts in October. Given its current low economic value, managers have requested evaluation of options for multi-annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) in an attempt to reduce the frequency (and costs) of assessment and associated management advice. A tentative relationship between sea surface temperature and recruitment is used to predict the impact of increasing sea temperatures on future recruitment in the context of global warming. Hypotheses of auto-correlation and of an environmental effect on recruitment, together with trends in weight-at-age and the overestimation of spawning-stock biomass, form the basis for sensitivity tests of the management options considered. Implementation of a 3-year fixed TAC with 40% constraint in TAC variability and a slight reduction in target F would seem appropriate for the stock, given that it is within safe biological limits and compares well in terms of yield and risk with the current approach of annual TAC revision.

"The anomalously strong hurricane activity in the Atlantic sector during the recent years led to a controversy about the impact of global warming on hurricane activity in the Atlantic sector. Here we show that the temperature difference between the tropical North Atlantic and the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans (Indo-Pacific) is a key parameter in controlling the vertical wind shear over the Atlantic, an important quantity for hurricane activity. The stronger warming of the tropical North Atlantic relative to that of the Indo-Pacific during the most recent years drove reduced vertical wind shear over the Atlantic and is thus responsible for the strong hurricane activity observed. In 2006, however, the temperature difference between the tropical North Atlantic and the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans is much reduced, which explains the relatively weak hurricane season.",0
"The most widely distributed coniferous forests in the world are the larch forests. In the Russian Federation they occupy 27.6 x 10(6) ha. In Siberia, the larch species Larix russica generally grows west of the Yenissei River, and Larix gmelinii grows to the east. The morphological and physiological features oft. gmelinii make it possible for this species to grow in the far north of eastern Siberia, where climate conditions are more severe: The range of air temperature fluctuations in this region is more than 100 degrees C, from 38 degrees C down to 64 degrees C below zero. One of the major adaptions to unfavorable soil conditions is provided by a specific feature of root formation in L. gmelinii, in which the apex central root dies off at the permafrost border and a root system develops in upper soil layer. The major larch vulnerability factors are natural and anthropogenic fires and damage caused by insects, which become more frequent with hot and dry weather. The consequences of projected global warming could be both positive and negative for larch forests. Permafrost melting may result in improved soil nutrition in the areas the larch forests occupy, yet the frequency of forest fires and damage by pathogens are likely to increase. Global warming is expected to cause forest dieback and increased areas of steppe in the southern regions of eastern Siberia.",0
"The formation of atmospheric aerosol particles ( homogeneous nucleation, forming of stable clusters similar to 1 nm in size), their subsequent growth to detectable sizes (> 3 nm), and to the size of cloud condensation nuclei, remains one of the least understood atmospheric processes upon which global climate change critically depends. However, a quantitative model explanation for the growth of freshly formed aerosols has been missing. In this study, we present observations explaining the nucleation mode ( 3 - 25 nm) growth. Aerosol particles typically grow from 3 nm to 60 - 70 nm during a day, while their non-volatile cores grow by 10 - 20 nm as well. The total particle growth rate is 2 - 8 nm/h while the non-volatile core material can explain 20 - 40%. According to our results, sulfuric acid can explain the remainder of the growth, until the particle diameter is around 10 - 20 nm. After that secondary organic compounds significantly take part in growth process.",0
"In the Low Arctic, a warming climate is increasing rates of permafrost degradation and altering vegetation. Disturbance associated with warming permafrost can change microclimate and expose areas of ion-rich mineral substrate for colonization by plants. Consequently, the response of vegetation to warming air temperatures may differ significantly from disturbed to undisturbed tundra. Across a latitudinal air temperature gradient, we tested the hypothesis that the microenvironment in thaw slumps would be warmer and more nutrient rich than undisturbed tundra, resulting in altered plant community composition and increased green alder (Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa) growth and reproduction. Our results show increased nutrient availability, soil pH, snow pack, ground temperatures, and active layer thickness in disturbed terrain and suggest that these variables are important drivers of plant community structure. We also found increased productivity, catkin production, and seed viability of green alder at disturbed sites. Altered community composition and enhancement of alder growth and reproduction show that disturbances exert a strong influence on deciduous shrubs that make slumps potential seed sources for undisturbed tundra. Overall, these results indicate that accelerated disturbance regimes have the potential to magnify the effects of warming temperature on vegetation. Consequently, understanding the relative effects of temperature and disturbance on Arctic plant communities is critical to predicting feedbacks between northern ecosystems and global climate change.",0
"There is growing interest in what controls the present distribution of terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica because of the potential use of biodiversity as an indicator or predictor of the effects of climate change. Recent advances in knowledge of distribution and ecophysiological performance of terrestrial vegetation means that an initial analysis of the potential influence of temperature is now possible. Regressions of species numbers of lichens, mosses and hepatics on latitude and mean annual temperature (standard macroclimatic data) were carried out, and the terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica could be divided into two zones. The microenvironmental zone lies south of around 72 degrees S, and biodiversity (richness and location) is uncoupled from the macroenvironment and is, instead, determined by the occasional coincidences of warmth, water, light and shelter. The macroenvironmental zone lies north of about 72 degrees S, and biodiversity (richness, cover and growth) is strongly positively linked to mean annual temperature; species numbers increase at about 9-10% per K (24.0, 9.3 and 8 species for lichens, mosses and hepatics, respectively) probably due to improved water availability through increased precipitation and longer active period (monthly degree-days also reach zero at about 72 degrees S) allowing greater productivity, completion of metabolic processes and a switch from survival to growth strategies. Cyanobacterial lichens appear to be a special case and may be expanding after being forced into northerly refugia. Warming will cause a southward movement of the boundary between the two zones but distribution in the microenvironmental zone will remain determined by local coincidences of environment and resources.",0
"Predicting how insect crop pests will respond to global climate change is an important part of increasing crop production for future food security, and will increasingly rely on empirically based evidence. The effects of atmospheric composition, especially elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)), on insect herbivores have been well studied, but this research has focussed almost exclusively on aboveground insects. However, responses of root-feeding insects to eCO(2) are unlikely to mirror these trends because of fundamental differences between aboveground and belowground habitats. Moreover, changes in secondary metabolites and defensive responses to insect attack under eCO(2) conditions are largely unexplored for root herbivore interactions. This study investigated how eCO(2) (700 mu mol mol-1) affected a root-feeding herbivore via changes to plant growth and concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phenolics. This study used the root-feeding vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus and the perennial crop, Ribes nigrum. Weevil populations decreased by 33% and body mass decreased by 23% (from 7.2 to 5.4 mg) in eCO(2). Root biomass decreased by 16% in eCO(2), which was strongly correlated with weevil performance. While root N concentrations fell by 8%, there were no significant effects of eCO(2) on root C and N concentrations. Weevils caused a sink in plants, resulting in 8-12% decreases in leaf C concentration following herbivory. There was an interactive effect of CO2 and root herbivory on root phenolic concentrations, whereby weevils induced an increase at ambient CO2, suggestive of defensive response, but caused a decrease under eCO(2). Contrary to predictions, there was a positive relationship between root phenolics and weevil performance. We conclude that impaired root-growth underpinned the negative effects of eCO(2) on vine weevils and speculate that the plant's failure to mount a defensive response at eCO(2) may have intensified these negative effects.",0
"Benthic dinoflagellates of the genus Ostreopsis are important components of subtropical and tropical marine coral reef-lagoonal environments. Currently, as a result of global warming and trade globalization, they are also distributed worldwide. These microalgae are shown to produce palytoxin, one of the most potent non-protein marine toxins known. The haemolytic assay is a very easy, rapid and sensitive method to determine palytoxin. However, under the conditions reported in previous works this assay is inadequate for a rigorous dose-response treatment, since: (1) it produces degenerate sigmoidal profiles, with a pronounced slope which makes the calculation of the ED50 very sensitive to the experimental err or; (2) at the usual work temperature, the in vitro stability of the system is low, which accentuates the variability and ambiguity of the response. To resolve these problems haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes is studied, including it's toxicological dynamics, kinetics, inhibition by ouabain and response to temperature. The results show that, to obtain a smoother, more stable and reproducible response, it is necessary to apply two resources simultaneously: operation at a moderate temperature and partial inhibition of the palytoxin by ouabain. It also produces highly reliable parameters and allows strict equivalencies to be established with the mouse bioassays, a traditional reference point, though bioethically questionable and 20 times less sensitive than the bioassay proposed here.

"Forest fires play a key role in the global carbon cycle and thus, can affect regional and global climate. Although fires in extended areas of Russian boreal forests have a considerable influence on atmospheric greenhouse gas and soot concentrations, estimates of their impact on climate are hampered by a lack of data on the history of forest fires. Especially regions with strong continental climate are of high importance due to an intensified development of wildfires. In this study we reconstruct the fire history of Southern Siberia during the past 750 years using ice-core based nitrate, potassium, and charcoal concentration records from Belukha glacier in the continental Siberian Altai. A period of exceptionally high forest-fire activity was observed between AD 1600 and 1680, following an extremely dry period AD 1540-1600. Ice-core pollen data suggest distinct forest diebacks and the expansion of steppe in response to dry climatic conditions. Coherence with a paleoenvironmental record from the 200 km distant Siberian lake Teletskoye shows that the vegetational shift AD 1540-1680, the increase in fire activity AD 1600-1680, and the subsequent recovery of forests AD 1700 were of regional significance. Dead biomass accumulation in response to drought and high temperatures around AD 1600 probably triggered maximum forest-fire activity AD 1600-1680. The extreme dry period in the 16th century was also observed at other sites in Central Asia and is possibly associated with a persistent positive mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). No significant increase in biomass burning occurred in the Altai region during the last 300 years, despite strongly increasing temperatures and human activities. Our results imply that precipitation changes controlled fire-regime and vegetation shifts in the Altai region during the past 750 years. We conclude that high sensitivity of ecosystems to occasional decadal-scale drought events may trigger unprecedented environmental reorganizations under global-warming conditions.

"Global surface temperature has increased markedly over the last 100 years. This increase has a variety of implications for human societies, and for ecological systems. One of the most obvious ways ecosystems are affected by global climate change is through alteration of organisms' developmental timing (phenology). We used annual botanical surveys that documented the first flowering for an array of species from 1976 to 2003 to examine the potential implications of climate change for plant development. The overall trend for these species was a progressively earlier flowering time. The two earliest flowering taxa (Galanthus and Crocus) also exhibited the strongest shift in first flowering. We detected a significant trend in climate suggesting higher temperatures in winter and spring over the sampling interval and found a significant relationship between warming temperatures and first flowering time for some species. Although 60% of the species in our study flowered earlier over the sampling interval, the remaining species exhibited no statistically detectable change. This variation in response is ostensibly associated with among-species variation in the role of climate cues in plant development. Future work is needed to isolate specific climate cues, and to link plant phenology to the physiological processes that trigger plant development.",0
"An understanding of the energy exchange processes at the surface of the earth is necessary for studies of global climate change. If the climate becomes drier, as is predicted for northern mid-latitudes, it is important to know how major agricultural crops will play a role in the budget of heat and moisture. Thus. the energy balance components of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), two drought-resistant crops grown in the areas where summertime drying is forecasted. were compared. Soil water content and evapotranspiration (ET) rates also were determined. Net radiation was measured with net radiometers. Soil heat flux was analyzed with heat flux plates and thermocouples. The Bowen ratio method was used to determine sensible and latent heat fluxes. Sunflower had a higher evapotranspiration rate and depleted more water from the soil than sorghum. Soil heat flux into the soil during the daytime was greater for sorghum than sunflower, which was probably the result of the more erect leaves of sorghum. Nocturnal net radiation loss from the sorghum crop was greater than that from the sunflower crop, perhaps because more heat was stored in the soil under the sorghum crop. But daytime net radiation values were similar for the two crops. The data indicated that models of climate change must differentiate nighttime net radiation of agricultural crops. Sensible heat flux was not always less (or greater) for sorghum compared to sunflower. Sunflower had greater daytime values for latent heat flux. reflecting its greater depletion of water from the soil. Evapotranspiration rates determined by the energy balance method agreed relatively well with those found by the water balance method. For example, on 8 July (43 days after planting), the ET rates found by the energy-balance and water-balance methods were 4.6 vs. 5.5 mm day for sunflower, respectively: for sorghum, these values were 4.0 vs. 3.5 mm day, respectively. If the climate does become drier. the lower soil water use and lower latent heat flux of sorghum compared to sunflower suggest that sorghum will be better adapted to the climate change.",0
"A field drought-rewetting treatment was artificially imposed in a Picea abies (L.) Karst. stand in each of four consecutive years (1992-1995) by means of a roof installed beneath the canopy. It was removed each year to allow natural rainfall rewet the soil in order to test Ulrich's (1980) 'Acidification pulse' hypothesis, viz. that rewetting a soil subsequent to drought results in net nitrification and acidification. NH4+ concentrations in the Drought plot humus water increased substantially following drought and rewetting in 1992 (3754 mu mol(c) L-1, i.e. 36% total cations), to a lesser degree in 1994 and 1995, and were accompanied by elevated pH values tin the range pH 5.7 to 6.3), whereas NH4+ levels and pH values (between pH 3.7 and 3.8) were unaffected during these times in the Control plot humus water. High NO3- concentrations were observed in the Drought humus water immediately after drought and rewetting in 1992, whereas in 1994 and 1995 there was a time-lag during which nitrate concentrations increased steadily. In contrast, NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were consistently low at all depths in the mineral soil waters of both the Drought and Control plots throughout the years of the experiment. Likewise, pH values were unaffected in the mineral soil water at these times, suggesting that microbiological activity and nitrification was largely confined to the O horizon at this site. This research then, indicates that Ulrich's hypothesis was not applicable in the Ballyhooly site. Ammonification dominated over nitrification after drought and rewetting under current Irish climatic conditions. However, under conditions of increased air temperatures, as in the 'global warming' scenario, the potential for enhanced nitrification and consequent acidification and leaching of NO3- produced after drought and rewetting may exist at Ballyhooly.",0
"Component extraction techniques are used widely in the analysis and interpretation of high-dimensional climate datasets such as global sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Principal component abalysis (PCA), a frequently used component extraction technique, provides an orthogonal representation of the multivariate data set and maximizes the variance explained by successive components. A disadvantage of PCA, however, is that the interpretability of the second and higher components may be limited. For this reason, a Varimax rotation is often applied to the PCA solution to enhance the interpretability of the components by maximizing a simple structure. An alternative rotational approach in known as independent component analysis (ICA), which finds a set of underlying 'source signals' which drive the multivariate 'mixed' dataset. Here we compare the capacity of PCA, the Varimax rotation and ICA in explaining climate variability present in globally distributed SST anomaly (SSTA) data. We find that phenomena which are global in extent, such as the global warming trend and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are well represented using PCA. In contrast, the Varimax rotation provides distinct advantages in interpreting more localized phenomena such as variability in the tropical Atlantic. Finally, our analysis suggests that the interpretability of independent components (ICs) appears to be low. This does not diminish the statistical advantages of deriving components that are mutually independent, with potential applications ranging from synthetically generating multivariate datasets, developing statistical forecasts, and reconstructing spatial datasets from patchy observations at multiple point locations.

"Conflict and indecision are hallmarks of environmental policy formulation. Some argue that the requisite information and certainty fall short of scientific standards for decision making; others argue that science is not the issue and that indecisiveness reflects a lack of political willpower. One of the most difficult aspects of translating science into policy is scientific uncertainty. Whereas scientists are familiar with uncertainty and complexity, the public and policy makers often seek certainty and deterministic solutions. We assert that environmental policy is most effective if scientific uncertainty is incorporated into a rigorous decision-theoretic framework as knowledge, not ignorance. The policies that best utilize scientific findings are defined here as those that accommodate the full scope of scientifically based predictions.",0
"Research on global climate change has increasingly focused on rapid (century-scale and decadal) changes. One such climate shift, the Younger Dryas cooling event(1), took place during the last deglaciation, from 13,000 to 11,700 years BP. Climate records from Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic sediment cores show high-frequency fluctuations implying significant (>5 degrees C) shifts in temperature at this time, taking place within 50-100 years (ref. 2), The origin of the Younger Dryas has recently been attributed to a reduction or cessation of deep-water production in the North Atlantic and a concurrent lessening of the heat flux from Low latitudes(3,4), The role of intermediate waters (1,000-2,000 m depth) is less certain, however, because climate proxies for this ocean reservoir are rare and ambiguous. Here we report on the use of a new climate archive, deep-sea corals from Orphan knoll (1,600 m depth) in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. The oxygen isotope ratios in the coral skeletons (accurately dated by the Th-230/U-234 chronometric method) change markedly coincident with the initiation of the Younger Dryas, suggesting that there were profound changes in intermediate-water circulation at this time.",0
"Gas-solid chromatography was used to determine B(2s) (gas-solid virial coefficient) values for eight molecular adsorbates interacting with a carbon powder (Carbopack B, Supelco). B(2s) values were determined by multiple size variant injections within the temperature range of 313-553 K. The Molecular adsorbates included: carbon dioxide (CO(2).): tetrafluoromethane (CF(4)); hexafluoroethane (C(2)F(6)); 1,1-difluoroethane (C(2)H(4)F(2)); 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane (C(2)H(3)ClF(2)); dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl(2)F(2)); trichlorofluoromethane (CCl(3)F); and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (C(2)H(3)Cl(3)). Two of these molecules are of special interest because they are ""super greenhouse gases"". The global warming potential, GWP, for CF(4) is 6500 and for C(2)F(6) is 9200 relative to the reference value of 1 for CO(2). The GWP index considers both radiative blocking and molecular lifetime. For these and other industrial greenhouse gases, adsorptive trapping on a carbonaceous solid, which depends on molecule-surface binding energy, could avoid atmospheric release. The temperature variations of the gas-solid virial coefficients in conjunction with van't Hoff plots were used to find the experimental adsorption energy or binding energy values (E*) for each adsorbate. A molecular mechanics based, rough-surface model was used to Calculate the molecule-surface binding energy (Ecal*) using augmented MM2 parameters. The Surface model consisted of parallel graphene layers with two separated nanostructures each containing 17 benzene rings arranged in linear strips. The separation of the parallel nanostructures had been optimized in a prior study to appropriately represent molecule-surface interactions for Carbopack B. Linear regressions of E* versus Ecal* for the Current data set of eight molecules and the same Surface model gave E* = 0.926Ecal* and r(2)=0.956. A combined set of the Current and prior Carbopack B adsorbates studied (linear alkanes, branched alkanes, cyclic alkanes, ethers, and halogenated hydrocarbons) gave a data set with 33 molecules and a regression of E* = 0.991 Ecal* and r(2)=0.968. These results indicated a good correlation between the experimental and the MM2 computed molecule-surface binding energies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Species movements in relation with global warming may increase the spatial overlap between exotic and endemic species, which is a critical issue for the conservation of biodiversity. The Mediterranean Sea, which is a receptacle for exotic species while being a hotspot for endemism, provides exceptional material for a case study. The aim of our study was to quantify (i) the increasing invasion from southern fish exotic species (Red Sea and Atlantic Ocean) that the Mediterranean biota is experiencing and (ii) the spatial overlap between exotic and endemic Mediterranean fish fauna following the northward movement of exotic species within the Mediterranean Sea in the context of global warming. The historical invasion dynamic of exotic fish species and the sea surface temperature series were reconstructed from 1810 to 2006 in order to estimate the correlation between invasion rate and climate. The geographical distributions of exotic and endemic fish richness before and after the period of global warming were used to assess the dynamic of spatial congruence. The results revealed (i) an acceleration of successful introductions from the Red Sea and (ii) the introduction of Atlantic species from lower latitudes in correlation with the increasing temperature of the Mediterranean Sea. We also showed an increasing overlap between the spatial distributions of endemic and exotic species richness. Taken together, our results suggest that endemic fish species are facing a growing number of exotic species because the Mediterranean Sea is acting as a catchment basin for southern species.",0
"P>Incorporating the beneficial use of industrial by-products into the industrial ecology of an urban region as a substitute or supplement for natural aggregate can potentially reduce life cycle impacts. This article specifically looks at the utilization of industrial by-products (IBPs) (coal ash, foundry sand, and foundry slag) as aggregate for roadway sub-base construction for the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, urban region. The scenarios compare the use of virgin aggregate with the use of a combination of both virgin and IBP aggregate, where the aggregate material is selected based on proximity to the construction site and allows for minimization of transportation impacts. The results indicate that the use of IBPs to supplement virgin aggregate on a regional level has the potential of reducing impacts related to energy use, global warming potential, and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), PM(10) (particulate matter-10 microns), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb). Regional management of industrial by-products would allow for the incorporation of these materials into the industrial ecology of a region and reduce impacts from the disposal of the IBP materials and the extraction of virgin materials and minimize the impacts from transportation. The combination of reduced economic and environmental costs provides a strong argument for state transportation agencies to develop symbiotic relationships with large IBP producers in their regions to minimize impacts associated with roadway construction and maintenance-with the additional benefit of improved management of these materials.",0
"An environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study of a specific tomato ketchup was carried out. The objectives of the work were to illustrate how LCA can be used in production development; to investigate the influence of the geographical location of certain processes, and to find ways to improve the product's environmental performance. In the screening LCA which includes the whole life cycle, the packaging and processing sub-systems were found to be significant in the total environmental impact made by ketchup. Accordingly, six alternative systems, including packaging, processing and transportation, were modelled and simulated The environmental impact categories included were energy use, global warming, acidification, eutrophication, photo-oxidant formation and the generation of radioactive waste. It was concluded that the current geographical location of the production of ketchup is preferable; the contributions to acidification can be reduced significantly; and the environmental profile of the product can be improved for either the type of tomato paste currently used or a less concentrated tomato paste. A shift to a less concentrated paste would also mean that traditional quality parameters of the ketchup could be improved. (C) 1999 Academic Press.",0
"The Sea of Japan, a semi-closed marginal sea (greatest depth similar to 3700 m) in the northwestern-most Pacific Ocean, has an independent, deep convection system, which is driven by the formation and the sinking of cool, saline surface water towards the bottom in severe winters. Continuous measurement of dissolved oxygen using highly precise versions of the Winkler titration method has revealed 8-10% decreases in the bottom concentration of oxygen (O-2) over the past 30 years. The temporal decrease in O-2 means an imbalance between the supply of O-2 from the surface and the in situ consumption of O-2 in decomposing organic matter, suggesting that the change in the deep convection pattern of the Sea of Japan is probably caused by global climate change to reduce winter cooling of surface seawater.

"Life cycle assessment (LCA) on total sewage sludge treatment systems including thickening. anaerobic digestion, dewatering, and incineration/melting was performed to estimate a global warming impact as carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. As representative processes for the assessment, the most typical and widely used processes were selected. Generally. the life cycle of actual treatment facilities consists of three stages: construction. operation and dismantlement. In this study, the amount of CO2 produced from the life cycle steps of existing unit sludge treatment processes, was calculated by inventory analysis of input materials. In addition, for all processes investigated, individual CO2 emission units (CEUs), i.e. the amount of emitted CO2 for treating a unit weight of sludge, were also calculated. By using the obtained CEU matrix, it was possible to simulate the CO2 production from various types of complex treatment systems as well as to trace the dominant cause of CO2 production in individual treatment processes.",0
"The climatic variability in the meridional mode of global atmospheric circulation is investigated by using the monthly geopotential height fields at 1000, 500, and 100 hPa during 1948 and 2004. The data are taken from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis. The leading meridional mode shows opposite characteristics in its spatial and temporal distributions at the high and low latitudes at the three levels. The latitude differences are significantly enlarged in recent 60 years. An abrupt change occurred in the mid-1970s, leading the phases of the first mode reversed at the low and high latitudes in both hemispheres. The variability is generally larger in Southern Hemisphere (SH) at 1000 and 500 hPa, but in Northern Hemisphere (NH) at 100 hPa. In contrast, the second meridional mode shows different features in its spatial and temporal distributions. It mainly manifests as the AAO and AO at 1000 and 100 hPa. The two oscillations have a negative correlation at interannual and interdecadal scales, and show strong anti-phase variations at the SH and NH high latitudes at 100 hPa level, suggesting that the mode could connect the SH and NH circulation at mid- and high latitudes and affect global climate change.",0
"In order to assure energy conservation, modem buildings have increased the airtightness of their structures, and decreased their ventilation volume, thus leading to a deterioration of indoor air quality (IAQ). With respect to this fact, the study employs condensed water electrolysis by solar energy to improve the IAQ. Besides hydrogen that can serve as substitute energy for environmental protection, oxygen can even offer valuable usages. The inflow of oxygen to indoors can reduce the concentration of CO2, While the optimal IAQ is maintained, not only the indoor ventilation load of air conditioners can be reduced with the decreased inflow of ventilation volume from the outdoors, the health of people indoors can also be maintained.. Using NaOH/KOH electrolytes of different concentrations, and through the inflow of the external air of different proportions to indoors for ventilation, the study is able to explain the relationship between the different indoor ventilation rates and the different descending rates of CO2 concentration indoors. The research results show that among the electrolyte samples of the study, KOH with 30 wt. % has the best electrolysis effect. If the cost for the establishment of a solar energy equipment is not taken into account, while a good CO2 concentration is maintained indoors, the energy conservation can at least be as high as 95.2%. The study contributes not only to the decrease of ventilation volume in order to conserve energy and to reduce the CO2 concentration indoors effectively, but also tp achieve the effect of double decrease of carbon emission during the serious climatic changes caused by global warming. Finally, the study hopes to pursue the three goals of environmental protection, energy conservation, and health simultaneously.",0
"This paper examines nine analyses of global ocean 0-/700-m temperature and heat content during the 43-yr period of warming, 1960-2002. Among the analyses are two that are independent of any numerical model, six that rely on sequential data assimilation, including an ocean general circulation model, and one that uses four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR), including an ocean general circulation model and its adjoint. Most analyses show gradual warming of the global ocean with an ensemble trend of 0.77 x 10(8) J m(-2) (10 yr)(-1) (=0.24 W m(-2)) as the result of rapid warming in the early 1970s and again beginning around 1990. One proposed explanation for these variations is the effect of volcanic eruptions in 1963 and 1982. Examination of this hypothesis suggests that while there is an oceanic signal, it is insufficient to explain the observed heat content variations. A second potential cause of decadal variations in global heat content is the uncorrelated contribution of heat content variations in individual ocean basins. The subtropical North Atlantic is warming at twice the global average, with accelerated warming in the 1960s and again beginning in the late 1980s and extending through the end of the record. The Barents Sea region of the Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico have also warmed, while the western subpolar North Atlantic has cooled. Heat content variability in the North Pacific differs significantly from the North Atlantic. There the spatial and temporal patterns are consistent with the decadal variability previously identified through observational and modeling studies examining SST and surface winds. In the Southern Hemisphere large heat content anomalies are evident, and while there is substantial disagreement among analyses on average the band of latitudes at 30 degrees- 60 degrees S contribute significantly to the global warming trend. Thus, the uncorrelated contributions of heat content variations in the individual basins are a major contributor to global heat content variations. A third potential contributor to global heat content variations is the effect of time-dependent bias in the set of historical observations. This last possibility is examined by comparing the analyses to the unbiased salinity-temperature-depth dataset and finding a very substantial warm bias in all analyses in the 1970s relative to the latter decades. This warm bias may well explain the rapid increase in analysis heat content in the early 1970s, but not the more recent increase, which began in the early 1990s. Finally, this study provides information about the similarities and differences between analyses that are independent of a model and those that use sequential assimilation and 4DVAR. The comparisons provide considerable encouragement for the use of the sequential analyses for climate research despite the presence of erroneous variability (also present in the no-model analyses) resulting from instrument bias. The strengths and weaknesses of each analysis need to be considered for a given application.",0
"Evaporation is an important component of surface heat and water balance, and is affected directly by land use and climate change. This paper studies the changes of evaporation in China associated with the global climate change, and explores characteristics of the corresponding regional water cycle variations. The 20-cm-caliber pan evaporation measurements collected from 427 meteorological stations in China from 1957 to 2001 are analyzed to disclose the small-pan evaporation variation trend in China and the associated causes. The results show that although the animal average temperature over China exhibits an upward tendency of 0.2 degrees C/10 yr for the past 45 years, the pan evaporation oil the whole has decreased by -34.12 mm/10 yr. Nonetheless, a significant increase of pan evaporation is observed in a few areas such as the northern part of the Greater Hingan Mountains in Northeast China and the Beishan Mountains in Inner Mongolia. The largest decrease of pan evaporation lies in East China, northern parts of Northwest China, South China, and southern Tibet. An analysis of energy balance and aerodynamics using Penman's formula proves that the drop of pan evaporation in East China is mainly due to a significant decline of source energy for evaporation, while that in West China is mostly attributed to an aerodynamic reduction. The analysis oil tendencies of various meteorological and other related factors shows that wind speed and sunshine hours are two most important factors causing the pan evaporation reduction in China.",0
"The application of pyrogenic carbon, biochar, to agricultural soils is currently discussed as a win-win strategy to sequester carbon in soil, thus improving soil fertility and mitigate global warming. Our aim was to investigate if biochar may improve plant eco-physiological responses under sufficient water supply as well as moderate drought stress. A fully randomized greenhouse study was conducted with the pseudo-cereal Chenopodium quinoa Willd, using three levels of biochar addition (0, 100 and 200 t ha(-1)) to a sandy soil and two water treatments (60% and 20% of the water holding capacity of the control), investigating growth, water use efficiency, eco-physiological parameters and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Biochar application increased growth, drought tolerance and leaf-N- and water-use efficiency of quinoa despite larger plant-leaf areas. The plants growing in biochar-amended soil accumulated exactly the same amount of nitrogen in their larger leaf biomass than the control plants, causing significantly decreased leaf N-, proline- and chlorophyll-concentrations. In this regard, plant responses to biochar closely resembled those to elevated CO2. However, neither soil- nor plant-soil-respiration was higher in the larger plants, indicating less respiratory C losses per unit of biomass produced. Soil-N2O emissions were significantly reduced with biochar. The large application rate of 200 t ha(-1) biochar did not improve plant growth compared to 100 t ha(-1); hence an upper beneficial level exists. For quinoa grown in a sandy soil, biochar application might hence provide a win-win strategy for increased crop production, GHG emission mitigation and soil C sequestration.",0
"Analyses of emissions, and consequent chlorine loading, show that projected use of 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HCFC-123) will result in a virtually indiscernible impact on stratospheric ozone. Parametric scenarios uphold this conclusion, even for extreme levels of emissions far exceeding those of current technologies and practices. Additional scenarios reaffirm the conclusion for continued use - beyond the scheduled phaseout date - as a refrigerant in closed systems. By contrast, use of this compound offers unique opportunities to reduce global warming. Moreover, time-dependent analyses show that the minimal contribution to stratospheric chlorine from HCFC-123 emissions will not peak until more than a decade after the residual peaks of chlorine and bromine, from prior chlorofluorocarbon and halon releases, subside. While no single index exists to compare the relative demerits of ozone depletion and climate change, three conclusions are clear. First, reversal of the buildup of bromine and chlorine (i.e., healing of the `ozone layer') is underway and progressing on target, while sufficient practical remedies for global climate change are far more difficult. Second, the analyses show that phaseout of all chlorinated, and conceptually - but much less probably - all brominated, compounds of anthropogenic origin targets some compounds that provide environmental benefits. Most chlorinated and brominated compounds do warrant phaseout; the exceptions are those with very short atmospheric lifetimes, and consequent low ozone depletion potential (ODP), that also offer offsetting environmental benefits. And third, since new global environmental concerns may, and probably will, be identified in the future, a more scientific approach is needed to determine environmental acceptability or rejection.",0
"Global climate change includes concomitant changes in many components of the abiotic flux necessary for plant life. In this paper, we investigate the combined effects of elevated CO2 (720 ppm) and temperature (+2 K) on the phytochemistry of three deciduous tree species. The analysis revealed that elevated CO2 generally stimulated increased carbon partitioning to various classes of phenolic compounds, whereas an increase in temperature had the opposite effect. The combined effects of both elevated CO2 and temperature were additive, i.e., canceling one another's individual effects. Obviously, the effects of global climate change on leaf chemistry must simultaneously consider both temperature and CO2. If these results are generally applicable, then the counteracting effect of the temperature is likely to play a major role in alpine, boreal, and arctic zones in determining the balance between populations of plants and herbivores.",0
"Only a few studies focused on variations in stem respiration within entire trees related to variations within sapwood temperature. In this study, sapwood temperature was measured in 1 cm depth at four positions in the stem of a 50-year-old cembran pine (Pinus cembra L.) throughout the year 1995. These temperature data were used to estimate variations in CO2 efflux within the stem, assuming that the temperature dependence of respiration was constant and that there is no difference in the number of living cells in the xylem throughout the entire stem. Respiration was compared on a surface area basis. South-facing sapwood temperatures were significantly higher than air temperature when compared to north-facing sapwood temperature. As a consequence annual respiration was up to 13% higher on the south than on the north side of the tree. Thus, within-stem variations in temperature have been taken into account when scaling up stem respiration from data obtained from one individual position within a tree.",0
"The aim of this study was to investigate long-term seasonal trends and decadal change patterns of monthly mean water vapor pressure (WVP) observation series at 16 meteorological stations scattered point-wisely over the Southeastern Anatolian Project (GAP) area in Turkey, where large-scale soil and water development projects have been put into practice since the 1970s. The record length of WVP observation series of each station varied between 31- and 41-years between 1962 and 2002. The monthly mean WVP observation series of each station was rearranged on seasonal basis. Sequential Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's slope estimator, and Spearman's rank-order correlation tests were employed for detection of likely trends, and Kruskall-Wallis test was used to detect decadal variations in WVP series of each observation station. A possible area of representation for each meteorological station was determined by using the Thiessen polygons technique in a geographical information systems media. It was found that 15 seasonal WVP series have a positive trend covering 97% of the GAP area in the summer season; although one WVP series has a negative trend direction. However, in the spring season, 33% of the area had a positive trend, and a negative trend did not appear in any stations. WVP records in the winter season showed an increasing trend over 19% of the GAP area, whereas a decreasing trend prevailed in 9% of the area. The study results led us to conclude that the substantial increase of WVP observations in summer season could be attributed to both the shift from rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture being made increasingly spacious year by year and building large water reservoirs in the GAP located in a semi-arid region. The results also indirectly suggested that the historical trends in the WVP parameters might be related to global climate change phenomenon.",0
"The realistic physical functioning of the greenhouse effect is reviewed, and the role of dynamic transport and water vapor is identified, Model errors and uncertainties are quantitatively compared with the forcing due to doubling CO2, and they are shown to be too large for reliable model evaluations of climate sensitivities, The possibility of directly measuring climate sensitivity is reviewed. A direct approach using satellite data to relate changes in globally averaged radiative flux changes at the top of the atmosphere to naturally occurring changes in global mean temperature is described, Indirect approaches to evaluating climate sensitivity involving the response to volcanic eruptions and Eocene climate change are also described. Finally, it is explained how, in principle, a climate that is insensitive to gross radiative forcing as produced by doubling CO2 might still be able to undergo major changes of the sort associated with ice ages and equable climates.",0
"Landings of North American Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) over the past century show multidecadal patterns, which most recently characterize unprecedented declines in abundance. Stock size is compared with sea surface temperature (SST) data in the marine nurseries of post-smolt Atlantic salmon. A previously described correlation between stock abundance and winter SST conditions was again documented; however, of more relevance to the survival of salmon post-smolts, a correlation was also observed between abundance and spring SST in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The relevance of the winter SST correlation was further investigated by considering winter conditions in the freshwater nurseries as a factor causing elevated overwintering mortality of pre-migrant parr. The salmon abundance time series was compared with air temperature and rainfall trends averaged over time and space. Air temperature and rainfall do not appear to be significant environmental variables in shaping salmon recruitment. The timing of smolt runs appears to be out of synchronization with ocean conditions in the post-smolt nursery areas. The relationship between marine and freshwater impacts may change with changing climate conditions. Persistent positive phase forcing in the North Atlantic Oscillation raises the concern that recent declines in Atlantic salmon are, in part, due to global climate change.",0
"Despite its role as an essential micronutrient, copper (Cu) can be present in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations able to cause adverse health effects on aquatic organisms. Although Cu is acquired by fish by either water or diet, studies that have investigated Cu impacts in fish have mainly focused on the toxicity of waterborne Cu. Moreover, as the majority of experiments were carried out under simplified conditions, little is known about the effects of natural factors other than competitive ions on Cu toxicity in fish. As temperature is a primary factor that affects the physiological state of poikilotherm organisms, we investigated the individual and combined effects of temperature and waterborne or dietary Cu on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of waterborne or dietary Cu at 20 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Transcriptional and enzymatic responses of various indicators of metabolic capacities as well as indicators of heat, oxidative and metal stresses were measured in fish muscle. Under our experimental conditions, temperature was the most important factor affecting the general condition of fish. Although no significant Cu accumulation was observed in the muscle of Cu-exposed fish, at 20 degrees C, waterborne and dietary Cu triggered significant changes in the transcription level of genes encoding for proteins involved in energy metabolism, metal detoxification and protein protection. Moreover, the response was quantitatively more important for dietary Cu than for waterborne Cu. Combined exposure to heat and Cu triggered the most significant changes in gene transcription levels and enzyme activities. During combined exposure to heat and Cu, in addition to synergistic effects of the two factors, both waterborne and dietary Cu impaired the adaptive response developed by fish to curb heat stress. Reciprocally, temperature impaired the adaptive response developed by fish to combat Cu toxicity. These results suggest that wild fish populations subjected to elevated temperatures due to seasonal warming or global climate change may become more susceptible to Cu pollution, and vice versa.

"prevailing ambient temperature during the reproductive phase is one of several important factors for seed and fruit set in different plant species, and its consequences oil reproductive Success may increase with global warming. The effect of temperature oil pollen performance was evaluated in sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), comparing as pollen donors two cultivars that differ in their adaptation to temperature. 'Sunburst' is a cultivar that originated in Canada with a pedigree of cultivars from Northern Europe, while 'Cristobalina' is a cultivar native to southeast Spain. adapted to warmer conditions. Temperature effects were tested either in controlled-temperature chambers or in the field in a plastic cage. In both genotypes. all increase in temperature reduced pollen germination. but accelerated pollen tube growth. However, a different genotypic response, which reflected the overall adaptation of the pollen donor. was obtained for pollen tube dynamics, expressed as the census of the nicrogametophyte population that Successfully reached the base of the style. While both cultivars performed similarly at 20degreesC. the microgametophyte population was reduced at 30degreesC for Sunburst and at 10degreesC for Cristobalina. These results indicate a differential genotypic response to temperature during the reproductive phase, which could be important in terms of the time needed for a plant species to adapt to rapid temperature changes.",0
"To better understand migratory divergences among Anguilla anguilla glass eels, the behaviour of individuals caught at the time of their estuary entrance was studied through their response to a light:dark cycle and then to both water current reversal and light:dark cycle. In a first experiment, fish moving with the flow in response to dusk (M+ fish) and fish that had not exhibited any movement (M- fish) were distinguished. Anguilla anguilla from these two groups were then individually marked and their response to water current reversal compared. M+ individuals mainly exhibited negative rheotaxis with a tidal periodicity, whereas positive rheotaxis was mainly exhibited by M- individuals. Thus, M+ A. anguilla glass eels showing negative rheotaxis appear to have the strongest propensity to migrate, the converse applies to M- ones showing positive rheotaxis. A small percentage of individuals (5%) were hyperactive, alternately swimming with and against the current with almost no resting phase. These fish lost c. 2 mg wet mass day(-1), whereas individuals which were almost inactive lost c. 1 mg day(-1). Wet and dry mass changes in relation to activity levels were compared with previous experiments and it was concluded that A. anguilla glass eel energy status might be involved in differences in migratory tendencies but other factors that might be important are discussed. It is proposed that any decrease in A. anguilla glass eel energy stores associated with global warming might lead to an increase in the proportion of sedentary individuals and thus be involved in the decrease in the recruitment to freshwater habitats.",0
"The uneven distribution of water resources, a growing population, urbanization and global climate change require new approaches for groundwater management in Turkey. ""Safe yield"" should yield to broader concepts such as ""sustainability"". Groundwater management needs to consider future needs of the people and all ecosystems in accordance with basin development models. Groundwater law needs to be expanded beyond quantity to address quality concerns. A new institutional framework should be established and groundwater regulation should reflect new approaches and ideas, in particular to address problems of application.",0
"The incidences of allergies, allergic diseases and asthma are increasing world wide. Global climate change is likely to impact plants and animals, as well as microorganisms. The World Health Organization, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cite increased allergic reactions due to climate change as a growing concern. Monitoring of indoor and ambient particulate matter (PM) and the characterization of the content for biological aerosol concentrations has not been extensively performed. Samples from urban and rural North Carolina (NC), and Denver (CO), were collected and analyzed as the goal of this research. A study of PM(10) (<10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) and PM(2.5) (<2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) fractions of ambient bioaerosols was undertaken for a six month period to evaluate the potential for long-term concentrations. These airborne bioaerosols can induce irritational, allergic, infectious, and chemical responses in exposed individuals. Three separate sites were monitored, samples were collected and analyzed for mass and biological content (endotoxins, (1,3)-beta-D-glucan and protein). Concentrations of these bioaerosols were reported as a function of PM size fraction, mass and volume of air sampled. The results indicated that higher concentrations of biologicals were present in PM(10) than were present in PM(2.5), except when near-roadway conditions existed. This study provides the characterization of ambient bioaerosol concentrations in a variety of areas and conditions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
"Many semiarid streams are threatened both by human demands and climatic effects (global warming), but little is known about their algal biodiversity and their conservation value, especially in Mediterranean areas. The aim of the present study was to evaluate annual changes in the structure and species richness of diatom communities in runs and pools of an oligohaline, semiarid stream in south-eastern Spain, and their relationship with nutrients and hydrology. The pool substrate was covered most of the time by a yellow-brown coat, mainly composed of diatoms and a few cyanophytes (Leptolyngbya). In the runs, cyanophytes were dominant (Rivularia) and diatoms occurred as epiphytes. The diversity of these diatom assemblages was high, particularly in the pools. Some species were present throughout the year, whereas others showed a bimodal growth pattern. Maximum biomasses were reached in summer in the pools and in autumn in the runs, when levels of phosphorus increased as a result of flooding. Species richness and diversity were correlated with hydrology and sulfate concentrations, whereas biomass (as chlorophyll a and ash-free dry weight) was associated with variations in temperature, conductivity and ammonium. These semiarid streams are refuges of biodiversity, representing habitats reliant on cycles of drought and floods, which should be considered in proposals for their conservation.",0
"Understanding external deciding factors in growth and morphology of reef corals is essential to elucidate the role of corals in marine ecosystems, and to explain their susceptibility to pollution and global climate change. Here, we extend on a previously presented model for simulating the growth and form of a branching coral and we compare the simulated morphologies to three-dimensional (313) images of the coral species Madracis mirabilis. Simulation experiments and isotope analyses of M. mirabilis skeletons indicate that external gradients of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) determine the morphogenesis of branching, phototrophic corals. In the simulations we use a first principle model of accretive growth based on local interactions between the polyps. The only species-specific information in the model is the average size of a polyp. From flow tank and simulation studies it is known that a relatively large stagnant and diffusion dominated region develops within a branching colony. We have used this information by assuming in our model that growth is entirely driven by a difftision-limited process, where DIC supply represents the limiting factor. With such model constraints it is possible to generate morphologies that are virtually indistinguishable from the 3D images of the actual colonies.",0
"Natural marine hydrocarbon seeps on continental margins today represent a small source of methane in the global atmosphere budget, which is dominated by anthropogenic sources and contributions from wetlands in the tropics and northern high latitudes. In glacial times with lowered sea level, exposed seeps must have vented directly to the atmosphere and the portion of methane that was formerly dissolved and oxidized in the ocean contributed to the global atmospheric methane budget. We estimate that during lowered sea level 40-100 X 10(12) g/yr of methane were added to the atmosphere from gas seeps on the exposed shelves. This source could account for much of the atmospheric methane during glacial episodes because major wetlands were largely absent prior to the Holocene. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"The recent increase in typhoon (tropical cyclone) activity has attracted great interest and induced heated debates over whether it is linked to global warming or only a return to an active phase of the well-known multi-decadal variability. Due to the short instrumental record, our knowledge is quite scarce on the complex processes and mechanism of typhoon generation, development, and evolution, especially for the rare but highly destructive super-typhoons. It is therefore very important to extend the time span of typhoon activity records. Paleotempestology, a young science that emerged in the early 1990s, studies past typhoon activity spanning several centuries to millennia before the instrumental era through the use of geological proxies and historical documentary records. This paper presents a brief review and synthesis on the major research advances and findings of paleotempestology with an emphasis on proxy technique development and applications. The methodology has been evolving from single geologic proxy to multi-proxy techniques by integrating microfossils, sedimentary organic elemental ratios, and stable isotopes, together with typical sedimentary textures and structures, for the diagnosis of storm deposits. A newly-developed proxy technique is employing oxygen isotopes preserved in growing laminae of tree rings, cave stalagmites, and reef corals to diagnose typhoon rainwater impacts. Historical documentary records have been systematically compiled and analyzed to reconstruct the history of typhoon activity in some regions. The extracted typhoon-proxy data show that there does not exist a simple linear relationship between typhoon frequency and Holocene climate (temperature) change. Typhoon activity should have a secular and constant linkage with ENSO fluctuations, in that more typhoons and hurricanes make landfalls in China, Central and North America during La Nina years than El Nino years. This finding is consistent with that derived from recent instrumental data. Shifts in positions of subtropical high exert great influence on storm tracks, but their long-term relationship is still not well understood. All these findings are significant in projecting typhoon trends under global warming scenarios. Future developments in paleotempestology should strengthen the following research fields: (1) proxy generation mechanism and preservation potential, (2) inter-validation of different proxy data, (3) recognition of storm and tsunami deposits, (4) evaluation of paleo-typhoon intensity, (5) numerical modeling, and (6) regional to global scale comparison studies.",0
"The forest hunter-gatherers of the middle Yangtze River basin, who were the first to invent pottery and led a sedentary lifestyle, may have begun to cultivate rice during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial global warming period. The earliest rice cultivation may have dated back to 14 000 calibrated (cal.) years before present (YBP). The global warming at 9000 cal. YBP in the early Holocene brought the development of the rice cultivation to the middle Yangtze River basin. On the other hand, ancient rice-cultivating and piscatorial society met a crisis at 4200-4000 cal. YBP that was characterized by a significant cooling of the climate. This climate deterioration led the northern wheat/barley-cultivating pastoral people to migrate to the south and invade, ultimately bringing about the collapse of the rice-cultivating and piscatorial society in the Yangtze River basin.",0
"This study investigated the effects of increased temperature and salinity, two potential impacts of global climate change, on the toxicity of two common pesticides to the estuarine grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio. Larval and adult grass shrimp were exposed to the fungicide chlorothalonil and the insecticide Scourge (R) under standard toxicity test conditions, a 10 degrees C increase in temperature, a 10 ppt increase in salinity, and a combined increased temperature and salinity exposure. Toxicity of the fungicide chlorothalonil increased with temperature and salinity. Toxicity of the insecticide Scourge (R) also increased with temperature; while increased salinity reduced Scourge (R) toxicity, but only in adult shrimp. These findings suggest that changes in temperature and salinity may alter the toxicity of certain pesticides, and that the nature of the effect will depend on both the organism's life stage and the chemical contaminant. Standard toxicity bioassays may not be predictive of actual pesticide toxicity under variable environmental conditions, and testing under a wider range of exposure conditions could improve the accuracy of chemical risk assessments.",0
"Climatic changes, together with an increase in the movement of cats and dogs across Europe, have caused an increase in the geographical range of several vector borne parasites like Dirofilaria, and in the risk of infection for animals and humans. The present paper reviews the effects of climate and other global drivers on Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens infections in Europe and the possible implications on the transmission and control of these mosquito-borne nematodes. In the last several years, growing degree day (GDD)-based forecast models, which use wide or local scale temperature data, have been developed to predict the occurrence and seasonality of Dirofilaria in different parts of the world. All these models are based on the fact that: there is a threshold of 14 degrees C below which Dirofilaria development will not proceed; and there is a requirement of 130 GDD for larvae to reach infectivity and a maximum life expectancy of 30 days for a vector mosquito. The output of these models predicts that the summer temperatures (with peaks in July) are sufficient to facilitate extrinsic incubation of Dirofilaria even at high latitudes. The global warming projected by the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that warm summers suitable for Dirofilaria transmission in Europe will be the rule in the future decades and if the actual trend of temperature increase continues, filarial infection should spread into previously infection-free areas. These factors not only favour incubation of Dirofilaria, but also impact on mosquito species. Recent findings have also demonstrated that Aedes albopictus is now considered to be an important, competent vector of Dirofilaria infections. This mosquito species could spread from southern to northern European countries in the near future, changing the epidemiological patterns of dirofilariosis both in humans and animals.

"The impact of management on global warming potential (GWP), crop production, and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in irrigated agriculture is not well documented. A no-fill (NT) cropping systems study initiated in 1999 to evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential in irrigated agriculture was used in this study to make trace gas flux measurements for 3 yr to facilitate a complete greenhouse gas accounting of GWP and GHGI. Fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O were measured using static, vented chambers, one to three times per week, year round, from April 2002 through October 2004 within conventional-till continuous corn (CT-CC) and NT continuous corn (NT-CC) plots and in NT corn-soybean rotation (NT-CB) plots. Nitrogen fertilizer rates ranged from 0 to 224 kg N ha(-1). Methane fluxes were small and did not differ between tillage systems. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased linearly with increasing N fertilizer rate each year, but emission rates varied with years. Carbon dioxide efflux was higher in CT compared to NT in 2002 but was not different by tillage in 2003 or 2004. Based on soil respiration and residue C inputs, NT soils were net sinks of GWP when adequate fertilizer was added to maintain crop production. The CT soils were smaller net sinks for GWP than NT soils. The determinant for the net GWP relationship was a balance between soil respiration and N2O emissions. Based on soil C sequestration, only NT soils were net sinks for GWP. Both estimates of GWP and GHGI indicate that when appropriate crop production levels are achieved, net CO2 emissions are reduced. The results suggest that economic viability and environmental conservation can be achieved by minimizing tillage and utilizing appropriate levels of fertilizer.",0
"The aim of this paper is to determine the possibility of the stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system which able to satisfy the electric load demand by using HOMER Software. Besides, it is always desirable to have an environmental friendly energy system in order to maintain its natural beauty and prevent the effect of global warming. As the project economics is concerned, it is necessary to indentify the system life cycle cost or Total Net Present Cost, TNPC, of the optimal hybrid energy system, where this also can be analysing by optimization in HOMER. For observing the realistic effect has on power system designed and it economics, it is also important to assess the effect of uncertainty or a change in sensitivity variable such wind speed and fuel price which this can be done by performing sensitivity analysis.

"Paddy soils under flooded rice produce nearly 18% of all methane (CH4) emissions in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. However, CH4 release depends on the intensity of soil reduction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of emissions of this greenhouse gas from six representative soils [Albaqualf (2), Endoaqualf (2), Udorthent and Hapludoll] of rice cultivation in southern Brazil, to identify the relation with soil proprieties and electrochemical changes in the soil solution after flooding. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse with three replications in a randomized block design. Rice was grown in PVC pots filled with soil and covered with a 10 cm water layer. CH4 emissions were evaluated weekly from the 3(rd) to the 66(th) day after flooding, using a gas trap fixed on top of the pots. The gas was collected every five minutes, four times, to estimate CH4 emission rates. Soil solution was collected and analyzed as well. The beginning of CH4 emissions varied according to the soil type and usually occurred when 90 % of Fe3+ had been reduced to Fe2+ and pH and Eh stabilized. Total CH4 emission varied from 8.5 to 44.2 g m(-2) and had a sigmoid relation to soil organic C (r(2) = 0.83, p < 0.05), suggesting that C availability only limited methanogenesis when levels were below 8 g kg(-1) C soil. The results illustrate that the dynamics and total fluxes were strongly affected by the soil type and efforts must be directed toward determining CH4 emission factors for the different representative soil types of rice cultivation in southern Brazil, and agricultural practices to mitigate greenhouse gases from the different soils should be evaluated.",0
"Most state-of-the art global coupled models simulate a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in climate change scenarios but the mechanisms leading to this weakening are still being debated. The third version of the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques) global atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model (CNRM-CM3) was used to conduct climate change experiments for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). The analysis of the A1B scenario experiment shows that global warming leads to a slowdown of North Atlantic deep ocean convection and thermohaline circulation south of Iceland. This slowdown is triggered by a freshening of the Arctic Ocean and an increase in freshwater outflow through Fram Strait. Sea ice melting in the Barents Sea induces a local amplification of the surface warming, which enhances the cyclonic atmospheric circulation around Spitzberg. This anti-clockwise circulation forces an increase in Fram Strait outflow and a simultaneous increase in ocean transport of warm waters toward the Barents Sea, favouring further sea ice melting and surface warming in the Barents Sea. Additionally, the retreat of sea ice allows more deep water formation north of Iceland and the thermohaline circulation strengthens there. The transport of warm and saline waters toward the Barents Sea is further enhanced, which constitutes a second positive feedback.",0
"Silicon nitride cleaning of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber was carried out by NF3 and C3F3/O-2 using a remote plasma source. The effects of cleaning gases on the silicon nitride cleaning and perfluorocompounds (PFCs) emission properties were studied. To improve the cleaning properties with C3F8/O-2, N-based gases such as N-2, N2O, and NO were added to an optimized condition of C3F8/O-2 (that is, C3F8 : O-2=3:7). The silicon nitride cleaning rate was increased by about 70 % from 260 to 440 nm/min by mixing 5 to 10 % of N-based gases to C3F8(30 %) /O-2(70 %). Million metric tons of carbon equivalents (MMTCEs) were investigated and MMTCEs were decreased from 5 x 10(-10) to 8 x 10(-11) by the addition of 5 to 10 % N-based additive gases to C3F8(30 % /O-2(70 %). In the case of NF3, silicon nitride cleaning rate was 900 nm/min and the MMTCE was lower than 5 x 10(-11) at 600 sccm of NF3. Even though N-based gas with added C3F8/O-2 shows a higher MMTCE and a lower silicon nitride cleaning rate than those by NF3, it is believed that N-based gas with added C3F8/O-2 is replaceable to NF3 due to such advantages as relatively low price and low F-2 emission.",0
"Fertilizer nitrogen (N) use is expanding globally to satisfy food, fiber, and fuel demands of a growing world population. Fertilizer consumers are being asked to improve N use efficiency through better management in their fields, to protect water resources and to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while sustaining soil resources and providing a healthy economy. A review of the available science on the effects of N source, rate, timing, and placement, in combination with other cropping and tillage practices, on GHG emissions was conducted. Implementation of intensive crop management practices, using principles of ecological intensification to enhance efficient and effective nutrient uptake while achieving high yields, was identified as a principal way to achieve reductions in GHG emissions while meeting production demands. Many studies identified through the review involved measurements of GHG emissions over several weeks to a few months, which greatly limit the ability to accurately determine system-level management effects on net global warming potential. The current science indicates: (I) appropriate fertilizer N use helps increase biomass production necessary to help restore and maintain soil organic carbon (SOC) levels; (2) best management practices (BMPs) for fertilizer N play a large role in minimizing residual soil nitrate, which helps lower the risk of increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions; (3) tillage practices that reduce soil disturbance and maintain crop residue on the soil surface can increase SOC levels, but usually only if crop productivity is maintained or increased; (4) differences among fertilizer N sources in N2O emissions depend on site- and weather-specific conditions; and (5) intensive crop management systems do not necessarily increase GHG emissions per unit of crop or food production; they can help spare natural areas from conversion to cropland and allow conversion of selected lands to forests for GHG mitigation, while supplying the world's need for food, fiber, and biofuel. Transfer of the information to fertilizer dealers, crop advisers, farmers, and agricultural and environmental authorities should lead to increased implementation of fertilizer BMPs, and help to reduce confusion over the role of fertilizer N on cropping system emissions of GHGs. Gaps in scientific understanding were identified and will require the collaborative attention of agronomists, soil scientists, ecologists, and environmental authorities in serving the immediate and long-term interests of the human population.

"Global climate change (GCC) has emerged in recent years as the highest-profile environmental issue of the early 21st century. Transportation institutions at all levels of government face significant challenges in effectively addressing GCC in terms of both the adaptation of the transportation system to the impacts of GCC and the mitigation of transportation's contribution to GCC. These challenges stem in large part from the fragmentation of decision making within and across governmental levels, the consequent mismatch of political boundaries, and the nature of options for effectively addressing GCC. This paper discusses these challenges and proposes a conceptual framework for rethinking how transportation institutions may more effectively address the connection between transportation and GCC. It includes an assessment of the current state and metropolitan planning activities related to GCC and the perspectives of various planning practitioners from across the United States. It also articulates several of the key institutional elements necessary for a GCC-responsive transportation agency, including entrepreneurial leadership, an appropriate geographic jurisdiction, a multidisciplinary organizational structure, appropriately aligned funding and planning structures, and adequate planning and implementation authority. Finally, it also offers several suggestions on potential research needs associated with climate change and transportation institutional change.",0
"Full-scale integrated assessment models (IAMs) allow many components of the global climate change problem to be examined in one framework. The chief advantage of the IAM approach over less complete modelling frameworks is that the socio-economic and environmental consequences of policy choices aimed at abating or adapting to climate change can be evaluated in their totality, However, the highly aggregate functional forms that IAMs currently embed are lacking in sufficient regional and sectoral detail to be totally credible. In this paper, ten reasons why regional studies are needed in support of the development of full-scale IAMs are given.

"Ceramic tiles are one of the most widely used materials in both commercial and residential buildings. As environmental problems increase, the need for environment-friendly building design increases. To achieve this, architects and engineers need reliable data on the environmental impacts of various building materials-including ceramic tiles. This paper reports the results of environmental impact assessment of ceramic tile production in Thailand. Key impact categories, including fossil fuel impact, global warming, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity were assessed. The results showed that when assessed by EDIP methodology, the global warming impact value of 3.73E+3 kg CO2-eq per megagram (Mg) of ceramic tile is quite prominent and is rather high compared with existing data in current literature. The human toxicity impact value is also significant. The values of the other impact categories were also determined and found to be relatively high. When assessed using the Eco-indicator 99 methodology, the results showed that the fossil fuel category was the most affected with a value of 8.62E+1 Pt per Mg of ceramic tile, followed by respiratory inorganics and climate change. Raw materials transportation stage yielded the highest environmental impact values. It is thought that the key factors responsible for the relatively high impact values are the process technologies employed and the long transportation distances of the raw materials. It was concluded that the environmental impact values of ceramic tile production in this study are different from, and in most cases higher than, the values presented in current literature.

"Shrubs are predicted to dominate tundra with warmer temperatures at northern latitudes. We tested the null hypothesis that addition of browse to a graminoid diet would not alter post-ingestive energy loss in muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus (Zimmermann, 1780)). Energy losses over 8 h following feeding were used to test our hypothesis. Willows (Salix alaxensis (Anderss.) Coville, Salix plan folia ssp. pulchra (Cham.) Argus) and birch (Betula nana L.) (twigs in winter, leaves in summer) were separately mixed at graded levels (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) with chopped hay (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and fed as single meals to muskoxen. Meals containing 2 60% browse were often partially or completely rejected. Meals containing 20%-60% woody or leafy S. alaxensis or S. p. pulchra resulted in higher energy expenditure than meals of 100% hay. Meals containing 20%-60% woody B. nana tended to decrease energy expenditure relative to 100% hay, while 20%-60% leafy B. nana was similar to 100% hay. We conclude there is an energy cost associated with consuming browse. This cost varies by browse species and type. Since muskoxen tolerated LIP to 40% browse in the diet, this cost may be within their ecological tolerance. This tolerance has important implications under global warming scenarios.",0
"The feared global climate change could have important effects on various environmental variables including rainfall in many countries around the world. Changes in precipitation regime directly affect water resources management, agriculture, hydrology and ecosystems. For this reason it is important to investigate the changes in the spatial and temporal rainfall pattern in order to improve water management strategies. In this study a non-parametric statistical method (Mann-Kendall rank correlation method) is employed in order to verify the existence of trend in annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall and the distribution of the rainfall during the year. This test is applied to about 250 rain gauge stations in Sicily (Italy) after a series of procedures finalized to the estimation of missing records and to the verification of data consistency. In order to understand the regional pattern of precipitation in Sicily, the detected trends are spatially interpolated using spatial analysis techniques in a GIS environment. The results show the existence of a generalized negative trend for the entire region. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"The temperature-dependent rate constant for the reaction of the OH radical with 1-bromopropane has been measured using the discharge flow technique with laser-induced fluorescence detection of the OH radicals. Rate constants were measured as a function of temperature between T = 271 K and T = 363 K. The temperature dependence is well described by a simple Arrhenius expression, k(T) = A exp[-E/(RT)]. We find that A = (5.75 +/- 0.9) x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and E/R = 504 +/- 50 K for the OH reaction rate with CH3CH2CH2Br. The reaction rate at T = 277 K is 9.3 x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), which implies that the atmospheric lifetime for CH3CH2CH2Br is approximately 15 days using the scaling method of Prather and Spivakovsky. In addition, the quantitative infrared spectrum for 1-bromopropane has been obtained using a Fourier transform spectrometer. Together with the atmospheric lifetime estimate, this spectrum implies global warming potentials of 0, 0.3, and 0.1 for integration time horizons of 20, 100, and 500 years, respectively. We have calculated the ozone depletion potential (ODP) for bromopropane based on the kinetic results using our 2-D model and using the standard semi-empirical approach. The semiempirical calculation of the ODP, using the 15 day lifetime and the model calculated vertical profile of 1-bromopropane, gives 0.0019. However, the 2-D model result is 0.027 using a fixed mixing ratio boundary condition for 1-bromopropane. It is likely that the semiempirical method is inappropriate for species with lifetimes as short as 15 days.",0
"Alongshore wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST) from coastal National Data Buoy Center buoys are used to study the variability of wind-driven coastal upwelling from 1982 to 2008. A long-term increase in upwelling is observed in central California (35 degrees N-39 degrees N) with stronger upwelling-favorable winds, colder water, and more frequent occurrences of upwelling days during the upwelling season (March-July). Further, a longer upwelling season is observed in the same region, starting earlier in the spring and persisting later in the fall. These interannual changes in upwelling strength and seasonal duration are investigated in this study. Changes in alongshore wind (forcing of upwelling) are poorly correlated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, but the Northern Oscillation and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation correlate with the geostrophic upwelling-favorable winds in the region. However, changes in SST (an upwelling response) are correlated with both changes in wind (upwelling forcing) and the climate indices. Although this short record cannot differentiate between multidecadal cycles and persistent trends, this data-based result does corroborate model-based projections of increased upwelling in this region due to global climate change. This increase in upwelling is understood to be a response to the strengthening of large-scale pressure gradient fields partially due to global-scale climate change. Farther north and farther south in California, other processes also have a significant influence on coastal conditions, such that the tendency for increased upwelling is not evident in the same way.",0
"The Earth is facing many serious environmental problems. The global warming problem has reached a point at which action cannot be delayed. It is necessary not only to expect novel technological development but also to create realistic solutions by extending conventional technologies. Tribology has supported various technological developments over the years and has also responded promptly to societal demands for decreasing substances from engineering products that would be hazardous to the environment. As societies aim to become sustainable, tribology needs to be involved and contribute to the solution more than ever before. Environmentally friendly tribology, eco-tribology, through progress in surface modification, is seen to be an effective engineering technology that can contribute very much to sustainable societies. Multi-scale surface texturing, which is a new concept of surface modification for tribo-materials, and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating technology were introduced as the expected future development.",0
"Vegetation change can affect the magnitude and direction of global climate change via its effect on carbon cycling among plants, the soil and the atmosphere. The invasion of non-native plants is a major cause of land cover change, of biodiversity loss, and of other changes in ecosystem structure and function. In California, annual grasses from Mediterranean Europe have nearly displaced native perennial grasses across the coastal hillsides and terraces of the state. Our study examines the impact of this invasion on carbon cycling and storage at two sites in northern coastal California. The results suggest that annual grass invasion has caused an average drop in soil carbon storage of 40 Mg/ha in the top half meter of soil, although additional mechanisms may also contribute to soil carbon losses. We attribute the reduction in soil carbon storage to low rates of net primary production in non-native annuals relative to perennial grasses, a shift in rooting depth and water use to primarily shallow sources, and soil respiratory losses in non-native grass soils that exceed production rates. These results indicate that even seemingly subtle land cover changes can significantly impact ecosystem functions in general, and carbon storage in particular.",0
"An annual index measuring past national losses and capable of measuring future loss from weather and climate extremes was developed to help measure future shifts in climate, a subject of great concern to the global warming issue and the insurance industry. Results from climate models indicate that a changed climate owing to global warming would alter and increase many extremes, and the objective of this study was to develop a national-scale index to monitor change in monetary losses and costs from weather and climate extremes. Forty-four historical variables addressing various aspects of weather and climate extremes and their effects on the U.S. economy since the late 1940s were assessed as potential input to such an index. Frequencies of most severe weather conditions from 1950 to 1997 did not correspond well with their financial impacts. However, hurricane losses did correspond with the frequency of intense hurricanes, and tornado losses corresponded well with the number of violent tornadic storms. Quality insurance loss data for several major storm types (thunder, hail, winter, and wind storms) were available, plus quality data on flood and hurricane losses, and all were adjusted to 1997 dollars. Techniques were developed to assess the effect of seasonal climate extremes on major crop yields and costs for electricity and natural gas consumed. Trends were upward for certain key variables between 1950 and 1997, including the incidence and losses associated with winter storms, flood losses, crop losses, and incidence of heavy rains. Trends were downward for other weather-driven loss variables including hurricane losses, energy costs, thunderstorm losses, wind storm losses, and hail losses. Nine loss variables were selected to develop the U.S. annual loss index, and in rank order, based on their average annual loss values, were energy costs, followed by losses from hurricanes, floods, severe convective storms, crops, tornadoes, winter storms, hail, and wind storms. The variables chosen also will be available in future years to allow a continuing assessment using the index. The 1950-1997 average annual index value was $17.47 billion (1997 dollars), with annual values ranging from a high of $54.4 billion in 1972 to a low of $2.4 billion in 1963. The 48-year trend of the index was unchanging with three notable high loss periods: 1950-1954, 1970-1974, and 1990-1994.",0
"In the recent years, global warming has dramatically increased the atmospheric carbon-dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperature. As a consequence of this, carbonation has become one of the most critical durability issues for concrete structures in urban environment. In this study, the climate scenario IS92a recommended by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is used for evaluating the effect Of CO2 concentration on carbonation of concrete. A modified mathematical equation, based on Fick's 1 st law of diffusion, is used to evaluate CO2 diffusion coefficient of concrete. The required cover depth of concrete is estimated by using the applicative methods of reliability and stochastic concepts to take microclimatic conditions into consideration. The tolerance of cover depth should be considered in order to prevent carbonation-induced corrosion. From the relationship between the weight loss of reinforcement and corrosion current density for a given time, the tolerance of cover depth to prevent carbonation-induced corrosion is suggested. It was observed that corrosion occurs when the distance between carbonation front and reinforcement bar surface (the uncarbonated depth) is < 5 mm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"THE Dynamics of Eddy Impacts on Marion's Ecosystem Study (DEIMEC) programme was begun in 2002 with the aim of understand the importance of the oceanic, upstream environment to the ecosystem of the Prince Edward Islands.(1) This island group consists of two small volcanic islands and provides many opportunities for studying ecological and evolutionary processes, for monitoring ecological changes in relation to global climate change and for conserving a unique component of the planet's biological diversity.",0
"A study has been conducted to assess the reasons for a significant decrease in the astronomic observing period since the Very Large Telescope of ESO (the European Southern Observatory) went into operation in 1998. Following a multi-year monitoring of meteorological parameters at the site of the ESO telescope in Paranal (northern Chile), the optimal climatic conditions observed there prior to the construction of the Very Large Telescope have not been as frequently recorded since. In order to determine whether this region is being subjected to long-term changes in climate consecutive to 20(th) century global warming, or whether the ENSO (El Nino/Southern Oscillation) event in the final years of the 1990s are responsible for this situation, climatological data from in situ measurements, upper-air soundings, analogical reconstructions of meteorological data to extend the records further back into the past, and large-scale re-analysis data have been used. The results point towards a dominant role of ENSO in the current problems that astronomers face with reduced observation time.",0
"Vertical profiles of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and beta-dimethylsulfoniopropionate, particulate (pDMSP) and dissolved (dDMSP), were measured biweekly in the upper 140 m of the Sargasso Sea (32 degrees 10'N, 64 degrees 30'W) during 1992 and 1993. DMS and pDMSP showed strong, but different, seasonal patterns; no distinct intra-annual pattern was observed for dDMSP. During winter, concentrations of DMS were generally less than 1 nmol l(-1) at all depths, dDMSP was less than 3 nmol l(-1) and pDMSP was less than 8 nmol l(-1). In spring, concentrations of both dDMSP and pDMSP rose, on a few occasions up to 20 nmol l(-1) in the dissolved pool and up to 27 nmol l(-1) in the particulate pool. These increases, due to blooms of DMSP-containing phytoplankton, resulted in only minor increases in DMS concentrations (up to 4 nmol l(-1)). Throughout the summer, the concentrations of DMS continued to increase, reaching a maximum in August of 12 nmol l(-1) (at 30 m depth). There was no concomitant summer increase in dDMSP or pDMSP, The differences among the seasonal patterns of DMS, dDMSP, and pDMSP suggest that the physical and biological processes involved in the cycling of DMS change with the seasons. There is a correlation between the concentration of DMS and temperature in this data set, as required by some of the climate feedback models that have been suggested for DMS. A full understanding of the underlying processes controlling DMS is required to determine if the temperature-DMS pattern is of significance in the context of global climate change.

"Landsat enhanced thematic mapper imagery (ETM) of 2002 and aerial photography of 1955, combined with published charts and field observations were used to interpret coastal changes in the zone between Kitchener drain and Damietta spit in the northeastern Nile delta, previously recognized as a vulnerable zone to the effects of any sea level rise resulting from global warming. The interpretation resulted in recognition of several changes in nine identified geomorphological land types: beach and coastal flat, coastal dunes, agricultural deltaic land, sabkhas, fish farms, Manzala lagoon, saltpans, marshes and urban centers. Reclamation of vast areas of the coastal dunes and of Manzala lagoon added about 420 kmA(2) to the agricultural deltaic land. About 48 kmA(2) of backshore flats, marshes, salt pans and Manzala lagoon have been converted to productive fish farms. The main urban centers have expanded; nearly 12.1 km(2) have been added to their areas, and new urban centers (Damietta harbor and the New Damietta city) with total area reach of similar to 35.3 km(2) have been constructed at the expense of vast areas of Manzala lagoon, coastal dunes, and backshore flats. As a consequence of human activities, the size of Manzala lagoon has been reduced to more than 65%. Shoreline changes have been determined from beach profile survey (1990-2000), and comparison of 1955 aerial photographs and ETM satellite image of 2002 reveal alongshore patterns of erosion versus accretion. The short-term rate of shoreline retreat (1990-2000) has increased in the downdrift side of Damietta harbor (a parts per thousand integral 14 m/year), whereas areas of accretion exist within the embayment of Gamasa and in the shadow of Ras El Bar detached breakwaters system, with a maximum shoreline advance of similar to 15 m/year. A sandy spit, 12 km long, has developed southeast of Damietta promontory. These erosion/accretion patterns denote the natural processes of wave-induced longshore currents and sediment transport, in addition, the impact of man-made coastal protection structures.",0
"A field station was established in a beech forest near Soro, Denmark in the spring of 1996 to provide a platform for Studies of atmosphere-biosphere interactions. The station is equipped with a 57-m mast and a 24-m scaffolding tower. The mast makes it possible to measure profiles of gaseous atmospheric compounds and meteorological variables and to undertake measurements of fluxes by the eddy covariance method. The tower gives access to the tree canopy where branch and leaf level exchange of water vapour and CO2 is measured. Soil-atmosphere exchange of gaseous compounds is investigated with gas flux chambers on the soil surface. Water-mediated transport of C and N is measured in throughfall, stemflow and soil water. The paper provides information on the site, vegetation, climate and soil and gives a description of the instrumentation and other technical installations at the site. The paper also presents and discusses example results from the measurements such as meteorological variables (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, radiation, rainfall and relative humidity), gaseous concentrations (O-3) and fluxes (CO2, CH4 and N2O), water mediated transport (NO3- and NH4+ in rainfall, throughfall, stemflow and soil water) and measurements on the trees (leaf area index, specific leaf area, litter fall, CO2 exchange at branch and leaf level, maximum photosynthetic capacity). The forest acted in all years as a carbon sink with an average uptake of 190 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Contributions, from CH4 and N2O in terms of global warming potential (GWP) were less than 10% of the CO2. CH4 was deposited and NO emitted, almost neutralising each other in terms of GWP Leaves at the top of the canopy had the highest photosynthetic capacity (mid summer maximum of 50 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) and leaves at the bottom the lowest (20 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), indicating a clear acclimation to light. Sun leaves generally had significantly lower specific leaf area (118 cm(2) g(-1)) and water content (42%) than shade leaves (specific leaf area: 282 cm(2) g(-1); water content: 53%). On an annual basis about 24% of the precipitation was lost as evaporation, 66% reached the forest floor as throughfall and 10% as stemflow. Due to leaching of NO3- from the trees, the forest floor received 30% more nitrogen than in precipitation, resulting in a total input of 2.9 g N m(-2) yr(-1)). The soil water was almost completely depleted in NO3- with NH4+ constituting 97% of the total available inorganic nitrogen.",0
"Under the background of global warming, does the effect of the rising global surface temperature accelerate the hydrological cycle? To address this issue, we use the hydro-climatic data from five sub-basins in Poyang Lake basin in the southeast China over the past 50 years, to investigate the annual and seasonal trends of streamflow and the correlations between streamflow and climatic variables. The Theil-Sen Approach and the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test are applied to identify the trends in the annual and seasonal streamflow, precipitation and evapotranspiration series. It was found that annual and seasonal streamflow of all the stations had increasing trends except Lijiadu station in wet season. Only 37.5% hydro-stations in annual streamflow increased significantly, while most stations increased at 95% significance level in dry season. Trends in annual and seasonal precipitation during the whole period were generally not as significant as those in evapotranspiration. The correlations between streamflow and climate variables (precipitation and evapotranspiration) were detected by the Pearson's test. The results showed that streamflow in the Poyang Lake basin are more sensitive to changes in precipitation than potential evapotranspiration.",0
"The relationship between permafrost conditions and the distribution of infrastructure in the Usa Basin, Northeast European Russia, is analyzed. About 75% of the Basin is underlain by permafrost terrain with various degrees of continuity (isolated patches to continuous permafrost). The region has a high level of urban and industrial development (e.g., towns, coal mines, hydrocarbon extraction sites, railway, pipelines). GIS-analyses indicate that about 60% of all infrastructure is located in the 'high risk' perma-frost area, here defined as the zones of isolated to discontinuous permafrost (3-90% coverage) with 'warm' ground temperatures (0 to -2degreesC). Ground monitoring, aerial photo interpretation, and permafrost modeling suggest a differential response to future global warming. Most of the permafrost-affected terrain will likely start to thaw within a few decades to a century. This forecast poses serious challenges to permafrost engineering and calls for long-term investments in adequate infrastructure that will payback overtime.",0
"This paper describes discharge properties of N(2) and CO(2)-based gas mixtures including a perfluorocarbon (PFC) gas such as CF(4), C(3)F(8) and C-C(4)F(8) under non-uniform field. The mixture ratio between a base gas of N(2) or CO(2) and the additive PFC gas was fixed as 9:1; namely, 90%N(2)/10%PFC or 90%CO(2)/10%PFC gas mixture. The PFC gases have even smaller global warming potential (GWP) than SF(6) gas and have good insulation properties as SF6 gas. Thus, PFC gas mixture is expected to be a SF(6) substitute without highly pressurizing the gas over the conventional pressure of 0.5 to 0.6 MPa. In this study, in order to compare the partial discharge (PD) inception voltage V(PD) and breakdown voltage V(B) properties between N(2) and CO(2)-based gas mixtures, as well as between the additive gas of PFC and SF(6) gas, we investigated these properties of the gas mixtures with a needle to plane electrode under ac high voltage application. The gas pressure was changed from 0.1 to 0.6 NIPa. As a result, it was found that V(PD) and V(B) characteristics of N(2) and CO(2)-based gas mixtures differed considerably, especially the gas pressure dependence of V(B) (so-called the N shape characteristics). V(B) characteristics of N(2)-based gas mixture including C-C(4)F(8) proved to be excellent within the test conditions over the wide gas pressure region, showing the maximum breakdown voltage. In terms of V(PD) properties, CO(2)-based gas mixture had an advantage over N(2)-based gas mixture due to higher V(PD). Furthermore, we discussed the synergy effects of V(PD) and V(B) for N(2) and CO(2)-based gas mixtures using the index R,, which was defined to quantify the degree of the effect. R(n) for CO(2)-based gas mixture was higher than that of N(2)-based gas mixture.",0
"Data on the spring arrival dates of 23 species of migrants in Leicestershire over a 50-year period are presented. Chiffchaff, Sand Martin, Blackcap and Sedge Warbler showed a significant trend towards earlier arrival over the period, while Tree Pipit, Cuckoo, Whinchat, Whitethroat and Garden Warbler showed It significant trend towards later arrival. Fifteen species arrived noticeably earlier in the 1940s, a period of warm springs, while several species showed earlier arrivals in the 1980s. A number of species showed later arrival dates in the 1960s and 1970s, when April temperatures were colder than average. Several species showed significant correlations between arrival date and temperature. Arrival dates of the earliest species were much more variable than those arriving later, while species arriving in the second half of April showed a generally synchronous arrival. The results are discussed in the context of global warming.",0
"We use diagnostic studies of off-line variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model simulations of terrestrial water budgets and 21st-century climate change simulations using the parallel climate model (PCM) to estimate the time required to detect predicted changes in annual precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E), and discharge (Q) in three sub-basins of the Mississippi River Basin. Time series lengths on the order of 50-350 years are required to detect plausible P, E, and Q trends in the Missouri, Ohio, and Upper Mississippi River basins. Approximately 80-160, 50, and 140-350 years, respectively, are needed to detect the predicted P, E, and Q trends with a high degree of statistical confidence. These detection time estimates are based on conservative statistical criteria (alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.10) associated with low probability of both detecting a trend when it is not occurring (Type I error) and not detecting a trend when it is occurring (Type II error). The long detection times suggest that global-warming-induced changes in annual basin-wide hydro-climatic variables that may already be occurring in the three basins probably cannot yet be detected at this level of confidence. Furthermore, changes for some variables that may occur within the 21st century might not be detectable for many decades or until the following century - this may or may not be the case for individual recording station data. The long detection times for streamflow result from comparatively low signal-to-noise ratios in the annual time series. Finally, initial estimates suggest that faster detection of acceleration in the hydrological cycle may be possible using seasonal time series of appropriate hydro-climatic variables, rather than annual time series.",0
"There are seven cyclic perfluoroalkane compounds, which can be detected in extremely low concentrations, that are used to track mass movement and transfer in a variety of research and practical applications. They are used in leak detection in underground storage and pipelines and in atmospheric transport and diffusion research on local, regional, and continental scales. They are likely to be a used globally for monitoring carbon sequestration in geological formations. The atmospheric background levels of these compounds must be accurately known, and trends in their concentrations determined for these compounds to be effective in monitoring CO2 reservoirs and because there are environmental concerns about their release. Results of measurements of perfluorocarbon background concentrations from two recent field programs are presented, and trends in these values examined using data collected over the last 25 years. The current atmospheric concentrations of these compounds are in the low parts per quadrillion levels, and their annual atmospheric growth rate is less than 1 part per quadrillion per year. The environmental effects of these compounds are examined and found to be negligible at current release rates.",0
"Weather has a significant impact on crop growth and development. This paper presents an overview of crop modeling and applications of crop models, and the significance of weather related to these applications. To account for the impact of weather and climate variability on crop production. agrometeorological variables are one of the key inputs required for the operation of crop simulation models. These include maximum and minimum air temperature, total solar radiation, and total rainfall. Most models use daily data as input, because variables at a smaller time scale are usually unavailable for most locations. It is important to define standard file formats for weather and other input data; this will expand the applicability of weather data by different models. Issues related to missing variables and data, as well as locations for which no data are available, need to be addressed for model applications, as it can affect the accuracy of the simulations. Weather generators can be used to stochastically generate daily data when data are missing or long-term historical data are unavailable. However, the use of observed weather data for model input will provide more precise crop yield simulations, especially for tropical regions. Many of the crop models have been applied towards strategic and tactical management decision making as well as yield forecasting. The predicted variability of crop yield and related variables as well as natural resource use is mainly due to the short- and long-term variation of weather and climate conditions. The results produced by the models can be used to make appropriate management decisions and to provide farmers and others with alternative options for their farming system. The crop models have been used extensively to study the impact of climate change on agricultural production and food security. Recently, they have also been applied towards the impact of climate variability and the effect of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on agricultural production and food security. It is expected that, with the increased availability of computers, the use of crop models by farmers and consultants as well as policy and decision makers will increase. Weather data in the form of historical data or observations made during the current growing season, and short-, medium-, and long-term weather forecasts will play a critical role in these applications.

"There is accumulating evidence that individuals leave their natal area and select a breeding habitat non-randomly by relying upon information about their natal and future breeding environments. This variation in dispersal is not only based on external information (condition dependence) but also depends upon the internal state of individuals (phenotype dependence). As a consequence, not all dispersers are of the same quality or search for the same habitats. In addition, the individual's state is characterized by morphological, physiological or behavioural attributes that might themselves serve as a cue altering the habitat choice of conspecifics. These combined effects of internal and external information have the potential to generate complex movement patterns and could influence population dynamics and colonization processes. Here, we highlight three particular processes that link condition-dependent dispersal, phenotype-dependent dispersal and habitat choice strategies: (1) the relationship between the cause of departure and the dispersers' phenotype; (2) the relationship between the cause of departure and the settlement behaviour and (3) the concept of informed dispersal, where individuals gather and transfer information before and during their movements through the landscape. We review the empirical evidence for these processes with a special emphasis on vertebrate and arthropod model systems, and present case studies that have quantified the impacts of these processes on spatially structured population dynamics. We also discuss recent literature providing strong evidence that individual variation in dispersal has an important impact on both reinforcement and colonization success and therefore must be taken into account when predicting ecological responses to global warming and habitat fragmentation.",0
"We consider estimation of quantile curves for a general class of nonstationary processes. Consistency and central limit results are obtained for local linear quantile estimates under a mild short-range dependence condition. Our results are applied to environmental data sets. In particular, our results can be used to address the problem of whether climate variability has changed, an important problem raised by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) in 200",0
"The aim of the study is to analyze three different waste treatment technologies by life cycle assessment tool. Sanitary Landfill, Incineration and gasification-pyrolysis of the waste treatment technologies are studied in SimaPro software based on input-output materials flow. SimaPro software has been applied for analyzing environmental burden by different impact categories. All technologies are favorable to abiotic and ozone layer depletion due to energy recovery from the waste treatment facilities. Sanitary landfill has the significantly lower environmental impact among other thermal treatment while gases are used for fuel with control emission environment. However, sanitary landfill has significant impact on photochemical oxidation, global warming and acidification. Among thermal technology, pyrolysis-gasification is comparatively more favorable to environment than incineration in global warming, acidification, eutrophication and eco-toxicity categories. Landfill with energy recovery facilities is environmentally favorable. However, due to large land requirement, difficult emission control system and long time span, restriction on land filling is applying more in the developed countries. Pyrolysis-gasification is more environmental friendly technology than incineration due to higher energy recovery efficiency. Life cycle assessment is an effective tool to analyze waste treatment technology based on environmental performances.",0
"Reconstruction of past climate change and ecosystem response is important to correctly assess the impacts of global warming. In this study, we provide a paleoenvironmental record of in-lake and catchment changes in northern Poland during the Late Glacial and early Holocene using various biotic proxies (pollen, macrofossils and Cladocera) preserved in the lake sedimentary record. Chronology was derived from palynological correlation with a well-dated pollen sequence from nearby-lying Lake Ostrowite and some well-dated events of vegetation history in Central Europe. Pollen analysis provided information on regional climate change affecting vegetation dynamics, whereas macrofossils supplied substantial information on the response of local flora and fauna to climatic, geomorphological and limnological changes. Data were supplemented by analysis of Cladocera remains, which are of special importance because of their quick response to changes in trophic conditions and climate (especially temperature). The bottom of the sediment core reflects an initial stage of the lake formed during the late Allerod. The Younger Dryas cooling apparently resulted in forest recession and presence of cold tolerant Cladocera species. Due to amelioration of climate at the end of the Younger Dryas and melting of ice, the lake deepened. The beginning of the Holocene was characterised by forest shrinkage and induced clear changes in local flora and fauna communities. The regional vegetation development deduced from the lake's core is generally consistent with the vegetation history of central Europe. Due to the location of the site near the seashore (oceanic climate and western wind), signals of warming came earlier than inland and in eastern Poland.",0
"A streamlined hybrid life cycle assessment is conducted to compare the global warming potential (GWP) and primary energy use of conventional and organic wheat production and delivery in the US. Impact differences from agricultural inputs, grain farming, and transport processes are estimated. The GWP of a I kg loaf of organic wheat bread is about 30 g CO2-eq less than the conventional loaf. When organic wheat is shipped 420 km farther to market, organic and conventional wheat systems have similar impacts. These results can change dramatically depending on soil carbon accumulation and nitrous oxide emissions from the two systems. Key parameters and their variability are discussed to provide producers, wholesale and retail consumers, and policymakers metrics to align their decisions with low-carbon objectives.

"This study concerns the thermotolerance of spores of mesophilic fungi isolated from a tropical semi-arid habitat subject to dry season fire in the Western Ghats, southern India. Among 25 species of Ascomycota isolated from leaf litter, nine were able to grow after incubation in a drying oven for 2 h at 100 degrees C; the spores of two of these species survived 2 h incubation at 110 degrees C, and one survived exposure to 115 degrees C for 2 h. The range of thermotolerance among mesophilic fungi isolated from the leaf litter was surprising: filamentous fungi from other habitats, including species that colonize scorched vegetation after fires and thermophilic forms occurring in self-heating plant composts, cannot survive even brief exposure to such high temperatures. It is possible that the exceptional heat resistance of the Indian fungi is related to adaptations to surviving fires. Genetic analysis of the physiological mechanisms of heat resistance in these fungi offers prospects for future biotechnological innovations. The discovery of extreme thermotolerance among common saprotrophs shows that this physiological trait may be more widespread than recognized previously, adding to concern about the evolution of opportunistic pathogens on a warmer planet. The fungi in this study are among the most heat-resistant eukaryotes on record and are referred to here as 'Agni's Fungi', after the Hindu God of Fire. (C) 2011 British Mycological Society.

"Several studies have been conducted on the response of crops to greater concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) (CO(2) fertilization) as a result of climate change, but only few studies have evaluated this effect on multipurpose agroforestry tree species in tropical environments. The objectives of this study were to quantify differences in growth parameters and in leaf carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations of Cedrela odorata L. and Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp. seedlings under current ambient temperature (32 degrees C daytime, 22 degrees C night time) and CO(2) (360 ppm) (AMB); CO(2) fertilization (800 ppm, 32 degrees C daytime, 22 degrees C night time) ((f)CO(2)); elevated ambient temperature (360 ppm, 34 degrees C daytime, 25 degrees C night time) (TEMP); and a combination of elevated temperature (32 degrees C daytime, 22 degrees C night time) and CO(2) fertilization (800 ppm) (TEMPx(f)CO(2)). Results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in seedling growth parameters (seedling height, number of stem leaves, leaf area ratio, shoot and root biomass, and shoot/root ratio) between treatments for both tree species. The greatest increases in growth parameters occurred in the TEMP and TEMPxfCO(2) treatments compared to the AMB treatment for both tree species. However, growth parameters were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the fCO(2) treatment compared to that of the AMB treatment. Leaf N concentration was 1 to 2.1 times lower (P < 0.05) in all treatments when compared to current ambient conditions (AMB) in both tree species, but no significant changes in leaf C concentrations were observed. Results from our study suggested that fCO(2) had the greatest negative impact on tree growth parameters, and leaf N concentrations were affected negatively in all treatments compared to current ambient conditions. It is expected that such changes in growth parameters and plant N content may impact the long-term cycling of nutrients in agroforestry systems.",0
"The results of spatial modelling based on various climatic change scenarios predict shifts in the geographical ranges of species Theoretically, a species can spread Into new areas if the local habitat composition meets its ecological requirements Therefore, habitat change in an unfavourable direction should inhibit climatically Induced range shifts in some species We tested this prediction using data on breeding bird distribution in the Czech Republic, a small central European country We selected 28 species whose northern range limits are in central Europe and compared their distribution in the Czech Republic between 1985-1989 and 2001-2003 From these species, we Identified 10 affected by habitat changes, such as a loss in environmental heterogeneity or agricultural intensification, using a local literature survey As a group, the 28 species did not show any significant changes in their breeding distribution However, those species affected by habitat change significantly restricted their distribution, whereas the remaining species not affected by habitat change Increased their distribution We suggest that the increasing occupancy of species not affected by habitat change could be caused by climate change However, climate cannot overshadow the negative impacts of land-use changes on the distribution of species affected by habitat change Therefore, such species could be seriously threatened they might not be able to track their climatic optima if future climate change proceeds in tandem with the destruction of their habitats",0
"Accurate prediction of changes in the relative elevation of coastal marsh surfaces has gained considerable importance in light of global-warming-induced sea-level rise. Shallow autocompaction is an important component of elevation change that acts to decrease relative elevation. Unlike vertical accretion, which can be determined from repeated surveys of artificial marker horizons, autocompaction is difficult to measure. This report presents the results of a preliminary study that uses cesium-137 dating and down-core measurements of sediment bulk density to numerically model vertical accretion, shallow autocompaction and surface elevation change. The models produce vertical accretion rates that are comparable to rates derived from artificial marker horizons, and long-term surface elevation changes that are in close agreement with sedimentation rates based on cesium-137 dating of well-compacted sediment. The model results suggest that average annual vertical accretion may be higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 6 to 2 Sedimentation rates derived from cesium-137 dating also are higher than average annual surface elevation change by a factor of 1 to 4.7. These findings suggest that sedimentation rates based on cesium-137 dating will tend to be lower than vertical accretion and higher than long-term surface elevation change. The results of the study re-emphasize the importance of fully accounting for shallow autocompaction when attempting to predict marsh surface elevation change.",0
"Breeding at the right time of the year is crucial for many temperate zone organisms, as any mismatch with their optimal breeding period leads to a reduction in fitness. The roles of the breeding partners in these adaptive decisions have, however, only rarely been studied. In blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) that breed in heterogenous Mediterranean habitats, nearby populations show up to 1-month differences in breeding time. This difference is adaptive as the optimal time for breeding varies by the same amount due to habitat characteristics. But which sex is determining this large difference in timing? We show here that the seasonal development of female reproductive activity (yolk precursor production) closely matches the local optimal breeding time in these two highly contrasted landscapes, while previous studies have demonstrated that male gonadal development does not. In accordance with this, quantitative genetic analyses reveal that timing for breeding is determined by the female only, with no evidence for an additive genetic male effect on laying date. Our results strongly suggest that the adaptive inter-population difference in the laying periods has been driven by females. The central role of females in the determination of breeding period needs to be included when studying how micro-evolutionary processes are affected by global climate change.",0
"The forests of Russia cover a larger area and hold more carbon than the forests of any other nation and thus have the potential for a major role in global warming. Despite a systematic inventory of these forests, however, estimates of total carbon stocks vary, and spatial variations in the stocks within large aggregated units of land are unknown, thus hampering measurement of sources and sinks of carbon. We mapped the distribution of living forest biomass for the year 2000 by developing a relationship between ground measurements of wood volume at 12 sites throughout the Russian Federation and data from the MODIS satellite bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) product (MOD43B4). Based on the results of regression-tree analyses, we used the MOD43B4 product to assign biomass values to individual 500 m x 500 m cells in areas identified as forest by two satellite-basedmaps of land cover. According to the analysis, the total living biomass varied between 46 and 67 Pg, largely because of different estimates of forest area. Although optical data are limited in distinguishing differences in biomass in closed canopy forests, the estimates of total living biomass obtained here varied more in response to different definitions of forest than to saturation of the optical sensing of biomass.",0
"A new model of reef-island evolution, based on detailed morphostratigraphic analysis and radiometric dating of three islands in South Maalhosmadulu Atoll, Maldives, is presented. Islands initially formed on a foundation of lagoonal sediments between 5500 and 4500 yr B.P. when the reef surface was as much as 2.5 m below modern sea level. Islands accumulated rapidly during the following 1500 yr, effectively reaching their current dimensions by 4000 yr B.P. Since then the high circum-island peripheral ridge has been subject to seasonal and longer-term shoreline changes, while the outer reef has grown upward, reducing the energy window and confining the islands. This new model has far-reaching implications for island stability during a period of global warming and raised sea level, which will partially reactivate the energy window, although it is not expected to inhibit upward reef growth or compromise island stability.",0
"There has been great interest in the global warming events that heralded the onset of the Eocene and particularly the response of mammalian faunas to these events. However, little information is available on the subsequent deterioration of tropical habitats in the interior of North America after these major warming episodes. The decline of tropical habitats is thought to have begun during the middle Eocene in the interior of North America, but until now, no studies have been able to document the details of this event. Recent fossil collection and stratigraphic studies from sites in southwestern Wyoming and northeastern Utah that span the middle Eocene offer a unique opportunity to evaluate changes in habitat in the western interior. Using a discriminant function analysis, habitats were reconstructed for a sequence of eight stratigraphically controlled middle Eocene assemblages. Adaptive profiles (diets, substrate use, and body masses) of fossil mammal communities were statistically compared to those of extant faunas from a variety of Neotropical habitats. Previously published magnetostratigraphic data from Utah provided a means to correlate our stratigraphic sections to the geomagnetic polarity time scale and the oxygen isotope record. The discriminant model shows that there was a significant change in the mammalian community ecology near the end of the late middle Eocene that is likely reflective of a habitat shift. When correlated to the time scale and oxygen isotope record, this key transition from forested habitats typical of the tropical early Eocene to more open woodlands began about 42 million years ago in this region of the Rocky Mountains.

"Environmental conditions control physiological processes in plants and thus their growth. The predicted global warming is expected to accelerate tree growth. However, the growth response is a complex function of several processes with both direct and indirect effects. To analyse this problem we have used needle nitrogen productivity, which is an aggregate parameter for production of new foliage. Data on needle dry matter, production, and nitrogen content in needles of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce ( Picea abies) from a wide range of climatic conditions were collected and needle nitrogen productivities, defined as dry matter production of needles per unit of nitrogen in the needle biomass, were calculated. Our results show that the nitrogen productivity for spruce is insensitive to temperature. However, for pine, temperature affects both the magnitude of nitrogen productivity at low needle biomass and the response to self-shading but the temperature response is small at the high end of needle biomass. For practical applications it may be sufficient to use a species-specific nitrogen productivity that is independent of temperature. Because temperature affects tree growth indirectly as well as through soil processes, the effects of temperature change on tree growth and ecosystem carbon storage should mainly be derived from effects on nitrogen availability through changes in nitrogen mineralization. In addition, this paper summarises data on dry matter, production and nitrogen content of needles of conifers along a temperature gradient.",0
"Historical written records of weather conditions that affect agriculture and living conditions in China can serve as a proxy for instrumental observations of the relative wetness and dryness, or precipitation amounts, for periods of time dating back to at least AD 1470. The dryness/wetness index (DW) data at 100 selected sites and at a subset of 25 sites with entirely continuous data indicate that during the growing season the number of sites with dryness increased rapidly in the 20th century, in contrast to a gradual increase and levelling off of wetness since the 18th century. Dry conditions existed mostly in northeastern China in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 20th century, dryness prevailed in most areas in China, and the chance of occurrence at each site increased. Wet conditions have expanded from east coastal areas to inland since the 19th century. As a result of increased dryness and wetness, the number of sites experiencing normal precipitation conditions has dropped dramatically. The number of sites with extreme dryness/wetness has also increased during the 20th century, and the spatial distribution of the sites with a large chance of extreme dryness/wetness has also changed. The frequent occurrences in dryness/wetness as well as in extremes in the 20th century seem indicative of an abnormality in climate on a large scale. Spectral analyses of the DW data has revealed that cycles in dryness/wetness and their extremes have existed with periods on relatively short time scales as well as on the long time scales. The possible existence of a century-scale cycle suggests that caution should be used in relating variations in rainfall conditions to global warming.

"Background and Aims A meta-analysis of global change experiments in arctic tundra sites suggests that plant productivity and the cover of shrubs, grasses and dead plant material (i.e. litter) will increase and the cover of bryophytes will decrease in response to higher air temperatures. However, little is known about which effects these changes in vegetation structure will have on seedling recruitment of species and invasibility of arctic ecosystems. Methods A field experiment was done in a bryophyte-dominated, species-rich subarctic heath by manipulating the cover of bryophytes and litter in a factorial design. Three phases of seedling recruitment (seedling emergence, summer seedling survival, first-year recruitment) of the grass Anthoxanthum alpinum and the shrub Betula nana were analysed after they were sown into the experimental plots. Key Results Bryophyte and litter removal significantly increased seedling emergence of both species but the effects of manipulations of vegetation structure varied strongly for the later phases of recruitment. Summer survival and first-year recruitment were significantly higher in Anthoxanthum. Although bryophyte removal generally increased summer survival and recruitment, seedlings of Betula showed high mortality in early August on plots where bryophytes had been removed. Conclusions Large species-specific variation and significant effects of experimental manipulations on seedling recruitment suggest that changes in vegetation structure as a consequence of global warming will affect the abundance of grasses and shrubs, the species composition and the susceptibility to invasion of subarctic heath vegetation.",0
"Global climate change will affect the ecology and environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, thus increasing attention is being paid to the aeolian desertification that is occurring in the watershed that supplies the Longyangxia Reservoir in the upper reaches of China's Yellow River. We must assess the aeolian desertification trends before developing a plan to restore the region's degraded eco-environment. In this study, land suffered from aeolian desertification was classified into four levels (slight, moderate, severe, and extremely severe) using a series of indices. Interpretation of Landsat MSS and TM data from 1975's, 1989's, and 2005's was used to establish databases of aeolian desertified land at these three times. We then derived the aeolian desertification trends during the study period by overlaying the consecutive databases, and we analyzed the driving factors responsible for the observed aeolian desertification. The results show a total of 1,721,478.02 ha of aeolian desertified land in 2005's, accounting for 13% of the region's total area. From 1975's to 1989's, the area of aeolian desertified land increased by 229,307.26 ha, which represents a 15% increase compared to the 1975's area; and from 1989's to 2005's, the area of aeolian desertified land decreased by 19,079.87 ha, which represents a 1% decrease compared to the 1989's area. The main driving factors responsible for this increased aeolian desertification were climate factors (high wind velocity and an increase in annual temperature, combined with low precipitation and high evaporation) as well as unsustainable human activities and inappropriate policy measures. A series of key national projects initiated to combat degradation of the study area's eco-environment led to a decrease of aeolian desertified land through obvious restoration of vegetation.

"Plio-Pleistocene East African grassland expansion and faunal macroevolution, including that of our own lineage, are attributed to global climate change. To further understand environmental factors of early hominin evolution, we reconstruct the paleogeographic distribution of vegetation (C(3)-C(4) pathways) by stable carbon isotope (delta(13)C) analysis of pedogenic carbonates from the Plio-Pleistocene Koobi Fora region, northeast Lake Turkana Basin, Kenya. We analyzed 202 nodules (530 measurements) from ten paleontological/archaeological collecting areas spanning environments over a 50-km(2) area. We compared results across subregions in evolving fluviolacustrine depositional environments in the Koobi Fora Formation from 2.0-5 Ma, a stratigraphic interval that temporally brackets grassland ascendancy in East Africa. Significant differences in delta(13)C values between subregions are explained by paleogeographic controls on floral composition and distribution. Our results indicate grassland expansion between 2.0 and 75 Ma, coincident with major shifts in basin-wide sedimentation and hydrology. Hypotheses may be correct in linking Plio-Pleistocene hominin evolution to environmental changes from global climate; however, based on our results, we interpret complexity from proximate forces that mitigated basin evolution. An similar to 2.5 Ma tectonic event in southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya exerted strong effects on paleography in the Turkana Basin from 2.0-5 Ma, contributing to the shift from a closed, lacustrine basin to one dominated by open, fluvial conditions. We propose basin transformation decreased residence time for Omo River water and expanded subaerial floodplain landscapes, ultimately leading to reduced proportions of wooded floras and the establishment of habitats suitable for grassland communities.

"Central and semiarid north-eastern Asia was subject to twentieth century warming far above the global average. Since forests of this region occur at their drought limit, they are particularly vulnerable to climate change. We studied the regional variations of temperature and precipitation trends and their effects on tree growth and forest regeneration in Mongolia. Tree-ring series from more than 2,300 trees of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) collected in four regions of Mongolia's forest zone were analyzed and related to available weather data. Climate trends underlie a remarkable regional variation leading to contrasting responses of tree growth in taiga forests even within the same mountain system. Within a distance of a few hundred kilometers (140-490 km), areas with recently reduced growth and regeneration of larch alternated with regions where these parameters remained constant or even increased. Reduced productivity could be correlated with increasing summer temperatures and decreasing precipitation; improved growth conditions were found at increasing precipitation, but constant summer temperatures. An effect of increasing winter temperatures on tree-ring width or forest regeneration was not detectable. Since declines of productivity and regeneration are more widespread in the Mongolian taiga than the opposite trend, a net loss of forests is likely to occur in the future, as strong increases in temperature and regionally differing changes in precipitation are predicted for the twenty-first century.",0
"Temperature sensitivities of microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production were investigated by using a novel method, thermal gradient (2-20A degrees C) temperature bar, in two typical peatlands (bog and fen) in North Wales, UK over 12 months. The study indicated that temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition in North peatlands was regulated not only by temperature but soil water content, dry-rewet event and phenologies. Potential decreases of Q(10) (CO(2)) with increasing soil temperature were confirmed in both peatlands, but Q(10) (DOC) increase with increasing soil temperature in both bog and fen sites. These results imply, if other factors such as the so-called CO(2) fertilization effect are simultaneously taken into account, that the feedback of global warming induced CO(2) release from peatlands to climate change may be overestimated in current biogeochemical models. However, global warming might have been nonlinearly accelerating DOC thermal production, and therefore it helps explaining the causes of remarkable increase of DOC in surface water in the Northern Hemisphere during last several decades.",0
"This work investigates seasonal and annual trends of temperature and precipitation from 1951/1971 to 2007 in the south-eastern part of Styria, Austria. Linear trends are calculated by least squares regression and analyzed for single station records and two different area-average time series. The focus area is represented by a regional mean and the two single stations Bad Gleichenberg and Gleisdorf. The regional mean over the focus area is calculated on the basis of seventeen stations in total previously tested by the standard normal homogeneity test. Changes in south-eastern Styria are compared with the urban station Graz University and with trends on a larger scale by the supra-regional mean over a greater territory north-east of the Alpine crest. In addition, some information regarding the sensitivity of linear trends is briefly discussed. The results reflect the warming in the 20(th) century and its acceleration since the 1950s and, in particular, since the 1970s. In the period from 1971 to 2007, significant trends are detected on annual and seasonal scales, except for winter temperatures. Similar trends are observed in spring and autumn (similar to 8 degrees C) but the maximum increase occured in summer (similar to 2.5 degrees C). For precipitation, annual data as well as the summer and winter seasons show a decreasing tendency from 1951 to 2007 and from 1971 to 2007. Although spring and autumn conditions are characterized by a much higher spatial variability, the regional mean over the focus area indicates an increase from 1971 to 2007. The findings of the present study illustrate south-eastern Styria as a region of high sensitivity to global warming. In particular since the 1970s, the changes in temperature and precipitation are an enhanced reflection of the large-scale trends.",0
"Global climate change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity; one of the most important effects is the increase in the mean earth surface temperature. However, another but poorly studied main characteristic of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We experimentally tested the effects of environmental temperature variability on characteristics associated to the fitness (body mass balance, growth rate, and survival), metabolic rate (VCO2) and molecular traits (heat shock protein expression, Hsp70), in an ectotherm, the terrestrial woodlouse Porcellio laevis. Our general hypotheses are that higher values of thermal amplitude may directly affect life-history traits, increasing metabolic cost and stress responses. At first, results supported our hypotheses showing a diversity of responses among characters to the experimental thermal treatments. We emphasize that knowledge about the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which animals cope with environmental changes is essential to understand the impact of mean climatic change and variability. Also, we consider that the studies that only incorporate only mean temperatures to predict the life-history, ecological and evolutionary impact of global temperature changes present important problems to predict the diversity of responses of the organism. This is because the analysis ignores the complexity and details of the molecular and physiological processes by which animals cope with environmental variability, as well as the life-history and demographic consequences of such variability.

"We estimate the global mean sea level (GMSL) change using TOPEX/Poseidon satellite radar altimeter measurements and investigate possible contributions from water mass redistribution within the global. hydrological cycle using a few numerical models. We examine the global mean sea level change at seasonal, interannual, and long-term time scales. The atmospheric and hydrological models include the ECMWF operational atmospheric model and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis system. The World Ocean Atlas 1998 and over 19 years' satellite sea surface temperature observations are used-to evaluate steric mean sea level change at different time scales. Both hydrological cycle and steric change provide important contribution to seasonal GMSL change. At interannual time scales, atmospheric water vapor variation shows good correlation to the altimeter observation and can introduce observable changes in the mean sea level. The snow water over Greenland and Antarctica estimated from the ECMWF model also shows encouraging interannual variability during the 1997/1998 El Nino period. Preliminary results show that thermal effect is a major but not a dominant contributor to long-term sea level rise, indicating that snow and ice melting associated With global warming may play an important role in driving GMSL rise.

"Assessment of physical risks is important with respect to costs and carbon yields from tree planting. Plantation losses were estimated for the Southern U.S. Commercial timber harvests are the principal cause of losses. Excluding harvesting losses, the annual survival rate is 98.4 percent. Wildfire, insects, and inclement weather are not major factors; diseases are the leading cause of mortality, but affect only a small number of plantations.",0
"Across vast, agriculturally intensive regions of the United States, the spread in predictions of summer temperature and soil moisture under global warming is curiously elevated in current climate models. Some models show modest warming of 2-3C degrees and little drying or slight moistening by the 22nd century, while at the other extreme are simulations with warming as large as 7-8C degrees and 20-40% reductions in soil moisture. We show this region of large spread arises from differences in simulations of snow albedo feedback. During winter and early spring, models with strong snow albedo feedback exhibit large reductions in snowpack and hence water storage. This water deficit persists in summer soil moisture, with reduced evapotranspiration yielding warmer temperatures. Comparison of simulated feedback strength to observations of the feedback from the current climate's seasonal cycle suggests the inter-model differences are excessive. At the same time, the multi-model mean feedback strength agrees reasonably well with the observed value. We estimate that if the next generation of models were brought into line with observations of snow albedo feedback, the unusually wide divergence in simulations of summer warming and drying over the US would shrink by roughly one third to one half.",0
"Recent information campaigns of media and the ongoing substantive discussions of experts have been more and more devoted to the climate change issue and its impacts that could affect our future and threaten the sustainable and balanced development of the planet Earth. However, the categorical apparatus as presented at the above mentioned events is not always used correctly and the same is true about the objective interpretation of the very nature of the processes. Also the explanations of realistic options of governance to mitigate and streamline the effects associated with climate variability in order to achieve the least possible damage of global environment are not always given appropriately. Because of a lack of specific statistical data on climate variability, which are usually at the sole disposal of professional climate scientists, and owing to the attention the public pays to these phenomena only at times of climatic anomalies (floods, extreme heat and drought, etc.), the issue is still on the edge of a broader awareness of people and academic research. This paper is in essence an overview of scientific works, which aims to contribute to the understanding of the issue of climate change by the means of summarizing the main approaches and use of categories, defining their substance and especially clarifying the phenomena in relation to possibilities of global governance.",0
"Northwestern Mediterranean warming-related disease outbreaks and species shifts have recently been documented. Biomarkers of short-term effects on the health or resistance of organisms are necessary to assess and understand mechanisms affecting marine biodiversity. Heat-shock protein (HSP) expression was here believed to present finer variations than previously reported in experimental studies, which we tested to assess HSP sensitivity and relevance in the global warming context. One population of the ""thermophilic"" marine cave mysid Hemimysis margalefi was monitored over 4 years. Three HSPs presented recurrent expression. Among them, HSP50 and HSP60 expressions varied seasonally with environmental temperature. HSP60 expression displayed the greatest variability and was most closely related to temperature fluctuations. Multiple regression showed that while the main stressor was temperature, demographic variables (proportion of immatures, proportion of gravid females) also influenced expression variability. Such a monitoring of HSP baseline expression in a natural population had only rarely been conducted. HSPs are, however, good biomarkers to evaluate the effects of warming episodes or heat stress in the wild. This study provides essential spatial and temporal reference for further experimental and in situ analyses and is a prerequisite to diagnostic and predictive approaches.",0
"Environmental cues control or synchronize the reproductive cycle of many marine invertebrates. Of these environmental cues, photoperiod and temperature have been shown to moderate reproduction either individually or in combination. In addition, they may act directly or, in the case of photoperiod, set circannual clock mechanisms. These environmental cues may affect a number of reproductive parameters, including sex determination, gametogenesis and spawning. Gonadotrophic and spawning hormones appear to act as the transducers between the environment and the gamete, and limited evidence indicates that temperature and photoperiod can alter levels of these. Such processes occur in a range of estuarine invertebrates that constitute important components of the diets of overwintering birds. Global warming is likely to uncouple and alter the phase relationship between temperature and photoperiod and this is likely to have significant consequences for animals that develop gametes during the winter and spawn in the spring in temperate northern latitudes. Species that cue reproduction to photoperiod are likely to be particularly vulnerable. Although this is unlikely to lead to extinctions, it may cause local extirpations. However, this will depend on speed of adaptation to changing climate in relation to speed of climate change and the degree of mixing between populations across the range of the species. More likely will be significant impacts on fecundity, spawning success and recruitment, and this may have significant implications for overwintering birds of national and international importance, and, ultimately, on the conservation status of estuaries such as the Humber in the UK.",0
"To enable experiments on the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and increased air temperature on physiological processes in trees to be carried out, we altered the standard design of open-top chambers by replacing blowers with evaporative coolers and in-line heaters, with a feedback control system to maintain ambient or elevated air temperatures within the chambers. Ambient and elevated (+ 4 degrees C) temperature regimes were attained consistently and reliably throughout the growing season, with high reproducibility between chambers. From May through December the average of nearly 300,000 temperature measurements was 18.5 degrees C in ambient air, 18.9 +/- 0.6 degrees C in six ambient chambers, and 22.4 +/- 0.9 degrees C in six elevated temperature chambers. The difference in soil temperature between ambient and elevated chambers was 2 degrees C. Absolute humidity (vapour pressure) in the chambers was higher than that of ambient air, but it was generally similar between temperature treatments. Vapour pressure deficit therefore was higher in elevated temperature chambers than in ambient chambers, and this difference is considered an inseparable part of the temperature treatment. The addition of a temperature control system to open-top chambers removes what has been an important flaw in this important tool for global change research.",0

"The effects of elevated carbon dioxide on plant-herbivore interactions have been summarized in a number of narrative reviews and metaanalyses, while accompanying elevation of temperature has not received sufficient attention. The goal of our study is to search, by means of metaanalysis, for a general pattern in responses of herbivores, and plant characteristics important for herbivores, to simultaneous experimental increase of carbon dioxide and temperature (ECET) in comparison with both ambient conditions and responses to elevated CO2 (EC) and temperature (ET) applied separately. Our database includes 42 papers describing studies of 31 plant species and seven herbivore species. Nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio in plants decreased under both EC and ECET treatments, whereas ET had no significant effect. Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and phenolics increased in EC, decreased in ET and did not change in ECET treatments, whereas terpenes did not respond to EC but increased in both ET and ECET; leaf toughness increased in both EC and ECET. Responses of defensive secondary compounds to treatments differed between woody and green tissues as well as between gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Insect herbivore performance was adversely affected by EC, favoured by ET, and not modified by ECET. Our analysis allowed to distinguish three types of relationships between CO2 and temperature elevation: (1) responses to EC do not depend on temperature (nitrogen, C/N, leaf toughness, phenolics in angiosperm leaves), (2) responses to EC are mitigated by ET (sugars and starch, terpenes in needles of gymnosperms, insect performance) and (3) effects emerge only under ECET (nitrogen in gymnosperms, and phenolics and terpenes in woody tissues). This result indicates that conclusions of CO2 elevation studies cannot be directly extrapolated to a more realistic climate change scenario. The predicted negative effects of CO2 elevation on herbivores are likely to be mitigated by temperature increase.",0
"In the last decades, numerous exotic species of microalgae have been found in the continental waters of Europe. In three natural shallow lakes located in the southwest of France, several planktonic species typically encountered in tropical areas were observed during 2006 and 2007. The most representative taxa were Planktolyngbya microspira Kom. & Cronb. P. circumcreta (G. S. West) Anagn. & Kom., Cyanodictyon tropicale Senna, Delazari & Sant'Anna and Staurastrum excavatum var. planctonicum Krieg. These species had so far only been reported from African lakes and other tropical areas, but in this study they accounted for up to 58 and 12% of the total abundance and biomass, respectively, during spring and summer. Some of these lakes were studied in the 1970s and only exotic desmids were reported; but at that time, the three cited cyanobacteria were not described yet. Waterfowl are considered as the main dispersers because they migrate over long distances, transporting algae on the feet and feathers or in the digestive tract. In fact, the Aquitaine Region is one of the main bird migration corridors in Europe. Survival of cyanobacteria, diatoms and desmids carried by birds could be possible due to resting stages, sheaths investments or vegetative cells. In addition, global warming may have contributed to the success of these tropical species in temperate lakes. Indeed, minimal temperatures have increased significantly in the Aquitaine region over the last 30 years and could have played a key role in algal survival through winter.",0
"The detection of small changes in concentration or thickness in the Arctic or Antarctic ice cover is an important topic in the current global-climate-change debate. Change detection using satellite data alone requires rigorous error analysis for their derived ice products, including inter-satellite validation for long time series. All models of physical processes are only approximations, and the best models of complicated physical processes have errors and uncertainties. A promising approach is data assimilation, combining model, in situ data and satellite remote-sensing data. Sea-ice monitoring from satellite, ice-model estimates, and the potential benefit of combining the two are discussed in some detail. In a case-study we demonstrate how the sea-ice backscatter for the Beaufort Sea region was derived using a backscattering model in combination with an ice model. We conclude that, for data assimilation, the first steps include the use of simple models, moving, with success at this level, to progressively more complex models. We also recommend reconfiguring the current remote-sensing data to include precise time tags with each pixel. For example, the current Special Sensor Microwave Imager data might be reissued in a time-tagged orbital (or gridded) format as opposed to the currently available daily averaged gridded data. Finally error statistics and quality-control information also need to be readily available in a form useful for assimilation. The effectiveness of data-assimilation techniques is directly linked to the availability of data error statistics.",0
"A descriptive study was carried out in the district of the Lake Geneva between March 1, 2005 and August 31,2006 to assess the incidence and prevalence of canine babesiosis, to genotype the Babesia species occurring, to assess the most frequently clinical signs found and to address the potential of autochthonous transmission. This included a data assessment on the different tick-populations occurring in the area and on the prevalence of Babesia-DNA in these ticks. A total of 56 veterinary practices participated in the study. By blood smear and PCI, Babesia canis canis was found in 12 out of 21 cases with suspected babesiosis. In an additional 13th case, the parasite could only be detected by PCR. All autochthonous cases originated from the Western part of the Lake Geneva region. Clinical signs in affected dogs included inappetence, apathy, anemia, fever, hemoglobinuria and thron-ibocytopenia. There were no risk factors with regard to age, sex and breed. Most cases were diagnosed during the spring periods of 2005 and 2006 (11 cases) and two cases in autumn 2005, coinciding with the main activity period of Dermacentor reticulatus, the main vector of B. canis canis. A total of 495 ticks were collected on patients by the veterinarians, 473 were identified as Ixodes sp., 7 as khipicephalus sanguineus and 15 as Dermacentor reticulatus. While Nodes sp. was found in the whole study area, D. reticulatus and R. sanguineus occurred only in the Western part till Lausanne. PCR and sequencing yielded B. canis canis positivity in 3 D. reticulatus specimen, these three ticks were collected from two different dogs both suffering from babesiosis. All R. sanguineus were negative by Babesia-PCR. Global warming, ecological changes in the potential habitat of ticks, increasing host- and vector-populations and increasing mobility of dog owners may be responsible for an emergence situation of infection risk for Babesia spp. by time. E.g.,Dermacentor reticulatus has become autochtonously prevalent already till Lausanne in the Lake Geneva region, and further surveillance is suggested to tackle this problem.",0
"In this study, N2O and NO were added as additive gases to C4F8O/O-2 for plastria enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon nitride chamber cleaning and their effects on the emission properties of perfluorocarbon compounds (PFCs) were investigated. The cleaning rate, destruction and removal efficiencies (DREs), and million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) were studied as a function of flow rates of PFCs and additive gases. The use of C4F8O/O-2 alone showed the highest cleaning rate and the lowest emission properties at the cleaning condition of 20%C4F8O/80%O-2, working pressure of 500 mTorr, and 13.56 MHz rf power of 350 W. By the addition of about 20% NO or 20% N2O to the optimized C4H8O/O-2, the additional reduction of MMTCE higher than 50% could be obtained. The addition of NO resulted in lower MMTCE compared to that in the case of the addition of N2O mostly due to the higher silicon nitride cleaning rate in the latter case.",0
"Numerical weather prediction has provided routine forecasts of global weather for more than thirty years. During that period numerical models have evolved from the use of low resolution balance equations to high resolution fluid dynamics equations with added terms to describe physical processes such as radiative heating and latent heat release. Both grid-point and spectral transform methods have been used. Forecasts require an initial state, and much effort has gone into data assimilation and initialization consistent with the nonlinear dynamics of the models. As is well known, the chaotic atmosphere is of limited predictability, and deterministic forecasts axe only good for about a week. The climate is defined by the statistical properties of the weather, and these change far more slowly. There is much current interest in the response of climate to human influences. Global climate change studies are largely based on weather models of lower resolution that are run for much longer times and averaged. But the search continues for a true climate model that deals directly with slowly evolving statistics.",0
"Climate change is promoting alterations of a very diverse nature in the life cycle of an array of insect species, including changes in phenology and voltinism. In Spain, there is observational evidence that the moth Lobesia botrana Den. & Schiff. (Lep.: Tortricidae), a key vine pest that is usually trivoltine in Mediterranean latitudes, tends to advance spring emergence, displaying a partial fourth additional flight, a fact that is potentially attributable to global warming. To verify this hypothesis, local temperatures were correlated with L. botrana phenology in six vine-growing areas of southwestern Spain during the last two decades (1984-2006) by exploiting the database of flight curves obtained with sexual pheromone traps. The dates of second and third flight peaks of the moth were calculated for each area and year and then correlated with both time (years) and local temperatures. The results obtained demonstrated a noteworthy trend towards local warming (as a result of global warming) in the last two decades, with mean increases in annual and spring temperatures of 0.9 and 3.0 degrees C, respectively. Therefore, L. botrana phenology has significantly advanced by more than 12 days. Moreover, the phenological advance contributed to increased moth voltinism in 2006 by promoting a complete fourth additional flight, a fact that has never been reported previously to our knowledge in the Iberian Peninsula. The potential impact of an earlier phenology and increased voltinism in L. botrana is discussed from an agro-ecological perspective.",0
"Behaviors of gas, species in electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasmas employing low global warming potential fluorocarbon gases of hexafluorobutadiene (C4F6) and hexafluoropropene (C3F6) with unsaturated carbon bonds together with the conventional octafluorocyclobutane (c-C4F8) are investigated. The spatial distributions of the absolute CF and CF2 radical densities are measured by combining the single-path infrared diode laser, absorption spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence techniques. CF2 radicals have hollow-type distributions at all conditions in the ECR plasma reactor. However, the spatial distribution of the CF radical density differs greatly from that of the CF2 radical density. Behaviors of carbon atoms measured by vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy disagree with those of CF and CF2 radical densities. The behaviors of ion and fluorine species and the gas pressure in the plasma have been also evaluated. Fluorocarbon films with low dielectric constant of about 3.0 are deposited at a high rate of 600 nm/min at high microwave powers in CA and C4F6 plasmas. The distribution of deposition rates of the film on the 8 m. Si substrate shows hill-type distributions, which are quite different from the spatial distributions of CF and CF2 radical densities. Therefore, CF and CF2 radicals do not directly contribute greatly to the growth of fluorocarbon films in these plasmas. The behaviors of C atom densities indicate the similar tendency to those of deposition rates of films. On the basis of systematically measured results of species in the plasma and film deposition rate on Si wafer, it is clarified that the C atom and polymeric species contribute dominantly to the formation of films at, a high rate in low-pressure and high-density fluorocarbon plasmas.

"In order to measure CO2 flux in wintertime arctic ecosystems, CO2 gas was sampled from various snow-covered grounds by using a closed chamber method during the First China Arctic Scientific Expedition from March to May in 1995. The CO2 gas samples were measured by using an infra-red analyzer (IRGA). The results show-ed that (i) CO2 emission was detected from all kinds of the snow-covered grounds, which provides direct evidence that the arctic tundra is functioning as a source of atmospheric CO2; (ii) CO2 release was also detected from the permanent ice profile and icecap, and (iii) CO, evolution from terrestrial ecosystems in higher latitudes increased with an increase of surface temperature in accordance with the exponential function. This indicates a close coincidence with that under normal temperature conditions, and provides a useful method for predicting change in CO2 flux in the arctic ecosystems with the global climate change.",0
"For climate modeling and atmospheric research, such as investigations of global climate change, remote sensing of cloud properties, or the missing absorption problem in clouds, it is most important to describe adequately the absorption of radiation by atmospheric gases. An improved method for the exponential sum fitting of transmissions (ESFT) is developed to approximate this absorption accurately. Exponentials are estimated separately for any number of atmospheric-model layers, considering the pressure and temperature dependence of the absorption lines directly. As long as the error of the fit exceeds a limit of tolerance, the number of considered exponential terms is successively increased. The accuracy of the method presented yields a root-mean-square error of less than 0.03% for any atmospheric-model layer, whereas the commonly used one-layer techniques gain errors of up to 3% in the transmission functions for the upper layers. The commonly used ESFT methods consider only one atmospheric layer and introduce the pressure and temperature effects for the other model layers afterwards.",0
"We used boreal winter output from an IPCC AR4 GCM simulation to drive an atmospheric tracer transport model with water vapor last saturation tracers over the northern hemisphere in order to identify processes that contribute to the projected increase in specific humidity of the subtropical relative humidity minimum. Most of the increase in specific humidity at the relative humidity minimum can be attributed to last saturation within what will be a warmer free troposphere. The water vapor content of the relative humidity minimum is projected to increase in the 21st century primarily as a function of increased last saturation temperatures in the tropical lower troposphere, effectively yielding more water vapor via poleward transport. The increase in specific humidity is to a degree kept in check by a poleward and upward shift of baroclinic instability and saturation patterns that effectively yield drier air to the RH minimum via isentropic transport.

"In the northern circumpolar zone, the area between the 600 degrees Cd and 1200 degrees Cd isopleths of effective temperature sum above 5 degrees C, the annual receipt of solar energy is limited by the low angle of radiation arriving at the earth's surface. This is the primary cause of the climatic constraints observed in the zone, such as low temperatures, a short growing season, frosts during the growing season, long and cold winters and thick snow cover. In Finland, the length of the growing season varies from 180 days in the south (60 degrees N) to 120 days in the north (70 degrees N). Consequently, the growing time for crops from sowing to ripening is also short, which limits their ability to produce high yields. The most advanced forms of farming in the high-latitude zone are encountered towards the south in Northern Europe, central Siberia and the prairies of Canada, i.e. mainly in the phytogeographical hemiboreal zone where the effective temperature sum is higher than 1200 degrees Cd. Conditions for agriculture then deteriorate gradually further north with the cooling of the climate, and this is reflected as an increase in cattle rearing at the expense of grain cultivation. In northern Europe farming is practised as far north as to the Arctic Circle, at about 66 degrees N latitude. In North America, fields extend to about 55 degrees N. In Asia, there are few fields north of 60 degrees N. Finland is the most northern agricultural country in the world, with all its field area, about 2.5 million hectares, located north of latitude 60 degrees N. Changes in the climate and atmospheric CO2 predicted for the future are likely to have a strong influence, either beneficial or disadvantageous, on the conditions for growth in northern areas where the annual mean temperature is 5 degrees C or less.",0
"In this paper, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from an uncontrolled landfill site filled with Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) are compared with those from controlled sites in which collected Landfill Gases (LFG) are utilised by various technologies. These technologies include flaring, conventional electricity generation technologies such as Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Gas Turbine (GT) and an emerging technology, Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). The results show that SOFC is the best option for reducing the GHG emissions among the studied technologies. In the case when SOFC is used, GHG emissions from the controlled site are reduced by 63% compared to the uncontrolled site. This case has a specific lifetime GHG emission of 2.38 tonnes CO(2 center dot)eq/MWh when only electricity is produced and 12 tonnes CO(2 center dot)eq/MWh for a cogeneration application.",0
"Late frost are dangerous climatic hazards that can be responsible of fruit trees yield losses. Late frost potential hazard is, in particular, increased by the enhancement of low-temperature episodes in spring and to the concomitant early-blooming consequent to higher winter temperatures induced by the earth global warming. This paper reports observations on the micrometeorological features associated to frost occurrence in a representative area of the Po valley in order to characterize the atmospheric physics during frost formation episodes, to understand the frequency and the type of risk and to develop the most suitable protection practices. Energy balance and soil radiation balance are reported together with the main atmospheric features (air turbulence included), and the data-set collected are verified against the similarity equations. The computation of the surface roughness and the friction velocity, fundamental to the definition of the distinctive features of the site, has been also done by applying the similarity theory.

"We examine the air quality (AQ) and radiative forcing (RF) response to emissions reductions by economic sector for North America and developing Asia in the CAM and GISS composition/climate models. Decreases in annual average surface particulate are relatively robust, with intermodel variations in magnitude typically <30% and very similar spatial structure. Surface ozone responses are small and highly model dependent. The largest net RF results from reductions in emissions from the North America industrial/power and developing Asia domestic fuel burning sectors. Sulfate reductions dominate the first case, for which intermodel variations in the sulfate ( or total) aerosol optical depth ( AOD) responses are similar to 30% and the modeled spatial patterns of the AOD reductions are highly correlated (R=0.9). Decreases in BC dominate the developing Asia domestic fuel burning case, and show substantially greater model-to-model differences. Intermodel variations in tropospheric ozone burden changes are also large, though aerosol changes dominate those cases with substantial net climate forcing. The results indicate that across-the-board emissions reductions in domestic fuel burning in developing Asia and in surface transportation in North America are likely to offer the greatest potential for substantial, simultaneous improvement in local air quality and near-term mitigation of global climate change via short-lived species. Conversely, reductions in industrial/power emissions have the potential to accelerate near-term warming, though they would improve AQ and have a long-term cooling effect on climate. These broad conclusions appear robust to intermodel differences.",0
"Abundant plant and vertebrate fossils have been recovered from fluvial sediments deposited in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, during the first 13 m.y. of the Tertiary. Here we outline and discuss changes in the composition and diversity of floras and faunas during this period, which includes the recovery of terrestrial ecosystems from the K/T boundary extinctions, and later, during the Paleocene-Eocene transition, the greatest global warming of the Cenozoic. Floral diversity has been studied at three levels of spatial resolution: sub-local (at individual collecting sites), local (along a single bed or stratigraphic horizon), and basin-wide (regional). Sub-local diversity shows a moderate increase from the early to late Paleocene, followed by a decrease across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, then an increase into the later early Eocene. Local heterogeneity was lower in Paleocene backswamp floras, although distinct groups of species dominated in different local fluvial settings such as backswamps and alluvial ridges. Heterogeneity of backswamp forests increased by about 65% from the early to late Wasatchian (early Eocene). The number of plant species inferred from the Bighorn Basin dataset rose gradually from the Puercan to an early Clarkforkian peak of about 40 species, declined sharply to about 25 species by the Clarkforkian/Wasatchian boundary, then rose through the Wasatchian to about 50 species. A regional analysis of mammalian genera shows high turnover and a rapidly increasing number of genera within a million years of the K/T boundary (10-50 genera), a slight decline to 40 genera by the early Clarkforkian, then an increase from 40 to 75 genera by the late Wasatchian. Our analyses found no major extinctions in mammals during the Paleocene and early Eocene in the Bighorn Basin, but a one-third decrease in the number of plant species at about the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. Rates of taxonomic turnover were much higher for mammals than plants. The diversity trends for plants and mammals show little congruence, implying that the two groups responded in a very different manner to post K/T extinction opportunities. There is also little congruence between plant diversity levels and change in mean annual temperature (MAT) as inferred from foliar physiognomy.",0
"The urban warming effect is interesting in its own right and is important for understanding global warming. The aim of this study is to determine how the urban warming effect changes with cloud conditions and with wind speed. Studies of the urban warming effect have mostly concentrated on the urban-rural difference in daily maximum or minimum temperatures. The problem was approached using a new technique. Instead of comparing a city, represented by a first-order weather station, with the surrounding rural area, represented by data collected by cooperative observers; pairs of cities, each with a first-order weather station, were studied. One city was large. The other city was small enough to have a minimal warming effect and was close enough to the larger city to approximately represent the rural area. In this way, hourly temperatures, cloud cover, and wind data could be studied rather than only the differences between the daily maxima or minima. Results show that wind disrupts the normal nocturnal cooling pattern in which the smaller city, with lower thermal inertia, cools more quickly than the larger city. Clouds also disrupt this pattern, at least to the extent that one must be careful about extrapolating either magnitudes or patterns of urban-rural temperature difference observed by satellites under clear sky conditions to partly cloudy or cloudy conditions.",0

"Scenarios of global climate change forecast an increase in air temperature of 3 degrees C over the next 100 years in eastern Canada. Growth and nutritive value of cool-season grasses are known to be affected by air temperature. It is also believed that grasses grown at high latitude have a greater nutritive value. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of four combinations of day/night temperature and photoperiod (15 h-17/5 degrees C; 15 h-22/10 degrees C; 15 h-28/15 degrees C; and 17 h-17/5 degrees C) on dry-matter (DM) yield, in vitro true DM digestibility (IVTD), in vitro digestibility of neutral-detergent fibre (NDF), and concentrations of NDF, acid-detergent fibre (ADF), lignin, minerals and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in timothy grown under controlled conditions. Furthermore, herbage was harvested in the morning and in the afternoon to assess the impact of the time of harvest. The dietary cation-anion difference [DCAD = (K(+) + Na(+)) - (Cl(-) + 0.6 S(2-))] and the grass tetany index [GT index = K(+)/(Ca(2+) + Mg(2+))] were also calculated. Higher temperature regimes significantly decreased IVTD and digestibility of NDF but had a limited effect on concentrations of NDF, ADF and lignin. DM yield of herbage was less and the concentration of NSC was greater in timothy grown under a temperature regime of 28/15 degrees C than the 17/5 degrees C and 22/10 degrees C regimes; this effect is mainly explained by a response to temperature stress. Values of DCAD and the GT index of herbage were also lower under the 28/15 degrees C than the 17/5 degrees C and 22/10 degrees C regimes as a result of a decreased plant K concentration. Under the 17/5 degrees C regime, an increase in 2 h of photoperiod resulted in increased DM yield, decreased concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Cl and N, and an increased starch concentration; IVTD or digestibility of NDF were not affected, although lignin concentration was reduced. Harvesting timothy in the afternoon rather than in the morning resulted in higher NSC, mainly sucrose, concentrations, and decreased ADF and NDF concentrations. The forecasted increase in air temperature in eastern Canada over the next 100 years will result in lower yields and nutritive value of timothy.",0
"Interpretation of the effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide on temperature is made more difficult by the fact that it is unclear whether sufficient global warming has taken place to allow a statistically significant finding of any upward trend in the temperature series. We add to the few existing statistical results by reporting tests for both deterministic and stochastic non-stationarity (trends) in time series of global average temperature. We conclude that the statistical evidence is sufficient to reject the hypothesis of a stochastic trend; however, there is evidence of a trend which could be approximated by a deterministic linear model.",0
"Serious gaps in knowledge about ocean spray at wind speeds over 40m/s remain difficult to fill by observation or experiment; yet refined study of the thermodynamics of Tropical Cyclones (including typhoons and hurricanes) requires assessment of the hypothesis that 'spray cooling' at extreme wind speeds may act to reduce (i) the initial temperature of saturated air rising in the eyewall and so also (ii) the input of mechanical energy into the airflow as a whole. Such progressive reductions at higher speeds could, for example, make any possible influence of future global warming on Tropical Cyclone intensification largely self-limiting. In order to help in extrapolation of knowledge on ocean spray to extreme wind speeds, a probabilistic analysis is introduced which allows for the effects of gusts, gravity and evaporation on droplet distributions, yet in other respects is as simple as possible. Preliminary indications from this simplified analysis appear to confirm the potential importance of spr ay cooling.",0
"Forested mineral soil wetlands (FMSW) store large stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), but little is known on: (i) whether the quality of SOC stored in these soils (proportion of active versus more resistant SOC compounds) differs from SOC in upland soils; (ii) how the quality of SOC in FMSW varies with mean annual temperature (MAT); and (iii) whether SOC decomposition rates in these environments respond to warming and drying more strongly than those observed in upland soils. To address this substantial knowledge gap, we identified nine FMSW and fifteen paired upland forest sites across three bioregions in North America (sub-alpine in Colorado; north-temperate in Minnesota; and south-temperate in South Carolina) to test the following three hypotheses. First, FMSW store a higher proportion of active SOC compared with upland systems because long anaerobic periods favor the accumulation of labile substrates. Second, in FMSW, SOC quality decreases from cold to warm bioregions because high quality detritus accumulates preferentially at cool sites where decomposition is slow. Finally, decomposition of SOC in FMSW will respond more strongly to warming under aerobic conditions than SOC from upland forest soils because of higher accumulation of active SOC in FMSW. To test these hypotheses, we incubated FMSW and upland forest soils at two constant temperatures (10 and 30 degrees C) for 525-d under aerobic conditions and constant moisture. In contrast to our first hypothesis, we observed similarly rapid depletion of active SOC compounds at initial stages of incubation across FMSW and upland sites, and across the 525-d incubations we observed overall lower SOC decomposition rates in our FMSW soils. In line with our second hypothesis, and across FMWS and upland soils, we found greater SOC loss in the sub-alpine bioregion than both temperate regions. In contrast to our last hypothesis, we found no difference in the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of SOC decomposition in FMSW and upland forest soils. Critically, total SOC loss (g SOC per g soil) was larger in FMSW because of the large amount of SOC stored in these ecosystems, indicating that despite a lack of difference between FMSW and upland responses, the total release of C from FMSW that could result from global warming may be large.

"We model the development of an individual insect, a grasshopper, through its nymphal period as a function of a trade-off between prey vigilance and nutrient intake in a changing environment. Both temperature and food quality may be variable. We scale up to the population level using natural mortality and a predation risk that is mass, vigilance, and temperature dependent. Simulations reveal the sensitivity of both survivorship and development time to risk and nutrient intake, including food quality and temperature variations The model quantifies the crucial role of temperature in trophic interactions and development, which is an important issue in assessing the effects of global climate change on complex environmental interactions.",0
"We assess changes in runoff timing over the last 55 years at 21 gages unaffected by human influences, in the headwaters of the Columbia-Missouri Rivers. Linear regression models and tests for significance that control for ""false discoveries'' of many tests, combined with a conceptual runoff response model, were used to examine the detailed structure of spring runoff timing. We conclude that only about one third of the gages exhibit significant trends with time but over half of the gages tested show significant relationships with discharge. Therefore, runoff timing is more significantly correlated with annual discharge than with time. This result differs from previous studies of runoff in the western USA that equate linear time trends to a response to global warming. Our results imply that predicting future snowmelt runoff in the northern Rockies will require linking climate mechanisms controlling precipitation, rather than projecting response to simple linear increases in temperature.",0
"Lake Baikal is the world's largest freshwater lake and is internationally famous for its rich and largely endemic biota. Concern about this unique ecosystem has grown since the late 1970s but whether recent biological changes result from natural fluctuations or pollution is unclear. One way of discriminating between these processes is to examine records of recent change in radiometrically dated deep-water sediment cores. Here we use high-resolution diatom analysis of one core to show that abundances have not changed significantly over recent decades. By contrast, we demonstrate that the lake is contaminated by atmospheric pollutants and has experienced a small qualitative change in soil derived magnetic minerals. Sedimentary lead concentrations show an increasing trend in the c. 150-year core sequence and spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) contaminate post-1930 sediment. Although we provide no evidence that twentieth-century pollution has affected the endemic planktonic diatoms in the central western region of southern Lake Baikal, longer trends in species abundances could be related to naturally occurring climatic cycles or to global warming.",0
"Production of organic carbon (OC) aerosols by biological activity in the ocean is hypothesized to influence climate change. We employ model sensitivity studies to assess the effects of ocean ecosystem changes on the marine OC fluxes by using an integrated Earth system model. Our modeled estimate of global marine primary OC emission (7 Tg OC yr(-1)) is comparable with that calculated from sensitivity simulation which uses chlorophyll concentration constrained by the satellite observations. The model significantly underestimates OC concentration in summer over the remote ocean without the ocean source, but better agreement could be achieved by adding the marine source. We apply simulated perturbations in chlorophyll concentration and the sea-ice extent by previous model run for the IPCC AR4 to the OC source function only. Our model results suggest an insignificant change in the global mean primary OC flux from the ocean to the atmosphere but with considerably large spatial variability due to the changes in chlorophyll concentration projected by the climate warming simulation. The major features of the geographical distribution are increases over the Arctic Ocean, which are associated with the chlorophyll concentration and the sea-ice extent changes primarily driven by the enhanced light efficiency for photosynthesis in the sea-ice free ocean. In climate chemistry and aerosol models that ignore this process, the future (late 21st century) surface OC concentration would be underestimated by 40-200 ng m(-3) in September over the Arctic Ocean (70-90 degrees N).",0
"The design and construction industries have ail increasing interest ill and responsibility for a building's environmental effects over its entire life cycle. Quantification of all building phases is important in life-cycle assessments (LCAs). especially for the construction phase, which is often disregarded.

"Sea ice is a very important indicator and an effective modulator of regional and global climate change. Current remote sensing techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor the cryosphere routinely with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we introduce a thermodynamic model to estimate sea and lake ice thickness with optical (visible, near-infrared, and infrared) satellite data. Comparisons of nighttime ice thickness retrievals to ice thickness measurements from upward looking submarine sonar show that this thermodynamic model is capable of retrieving ice thickness up to 2.8 m. The mean absolute error is 0.18 m for samples with a mean ice thickness of 62 m, i.e., an 11% mean absolute error. Comparisons with in situ Canadian stations and moored upward looking sonar measurements show similar results. Sensitivity studies indicate that the largest errors come from uncertainties in surface albedo and downward solar radiation flux estimates from satellite data, followed by uncertainties in snow depth and cloud fractional coverage. Due to the relatively large uncertainties in current satellite retrievals of surface albedo and surface downward shortwave radiation flux, the current model is not recommended for use with daytime data. For nighttime data, the model is capable of resolving regional and seasonal variations in ice thickness and is useful for climatological analysis.",0
"Recent, global mass-mortalities of reef corals due to record warm sea temperatures have led researchers to consider global warming as one of the most significant threats to the persistence of coral reef ecosystems. The passage of a hurricane can alleviate thermal stress on coral reefs, highlighting the potential for hurricane-associated cooling to mitigate climate change impacts. We provide evidence that hurricane-induced cooling was responsible for the documented differences in the extent and recovery time of coral bleaching between the Florida Reef Tract and the U.S. Virgin Islands during the Caribbean-wide 2005 bleaching event. These results are the only known scenario where the effects of a hurricane can benefit a stressed marine community.",0
"The Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is characterized by a global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) and widespread dissolution of seafloor carbonate sediments. The latter feature supports the hypothesis that the PETM and CIE were caused by the rapid release of a large mass (greater than 2000 Ct C) of 12 C-enriched carbon. The source of this carbon, however, remains a mystery. Possible sources include volcanically driven thermal combustion of organic-rich sediment, dissociation of seafloor methane hydrates and desiccation and oxidation of soil/sediment organics. A key constraint on the source(s) is the rate at which the carbon was released. Fast rates would be consistent with a catastrophic event, e.g. massive methane hydrate dissociation, whereas slower rates might implicate other processes. The PETM carbon flux is currently constrained by high-resolution marine and terrestrial records of the CIE. In pelagic bulk carbonate records, the onset of the CIE is often expressed as a single- or multiple-step excursion extending over 10(4) years. Individual planktonic shell records, in contrast, always show a single-step CIE, with either pre-excursion or excursion isotope values, but no transition values. Benthic foraminifera, records, which are less complete owing to extinction and diminutive assemblages, show a delayed excursion. Here, we compile and evaluate the individual planktonic shell isotope data, from several localities. Ve find that the most expanded records consistently show a bimodal isotope distribution pattern regardless of location, water depth or depositional facies. This suggests one of several possibilities: (i) the isotopic composition of the surface ocean/atmosphere declined in a geologic instant ( < 500 yr), (ii) that during the onset of the CIE, most shells of mixed-layer planktonic foraminifera were dissolved, or (iii) the abundances or shell",0
"The impact of climate change on schistosomiasis transmission has attracted considerable attention in recent years. As the intermediate hosts for schistosomes, snails play an obligatory role in schistosomiasis transmission. In order to determine the impact of low temperature on snail survival, we studied crystallization temperature (Tc) and lower lethal temperature (LLT) of the snail Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of human blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum, under different physiological conditions. The mean T c of 'dry' snails was -12.79 +/- 17 degrees C, which is significantly lower than that of 'wet' snails (-5.36 +/- 2.11 degrees C). Survival of 'dry' snails was high (92% after 24 h) when the temperature was higher than -7 degrees C, then decreased rapidly between -7 degrees C and -12 degrees C (92% to 0% after 24h). LT(50) between 0.25 h and 24 h exposure was between -10.8 degrees C and -9.4 degrees C. Our data suggest that O. hupensis out of water could be avoiding freezing. As winter temperatures continue to rise due to global warming, O. hupensis may increase its range, thereby spreading schistosomiasis to the northern part of China.",0
"The potential effects of global warming on the occurrence of four types of Japanese pest insects were studied by developing a computer program. The number of generations of each insect under present thermal condition and after 2 degrees C warming at 960 locations in Japan where temperature data was measured by the AMeDAS system was estimated. Thermal summation and daylength models were used to describe insect development and deleterious effects of low and high temperatures on the insects. In most regions, a non-diapausing insect, Plutella xylostella would complete two additional generations compared to the present. In a winter diapausing insect, Chile suppressalis, the northern boundaries of zones of two and three generations would shift northward by about 300 km. A cold weather susceptible insect, Tribolium confusum, would expand its distribution area northward, but the northern front of its distribution would not shift markedly, except for in the central mountainous regions of the Main Island. Ephestia kuhniella, which is susceptible to hot weather, would not be able to occur in the western part of the Main Island and Shikoku and Kyushu Islands due to high temperatures in summer, leading to a large shrinkage in its distribution area in Japan. Our results demonstrated that the effects of global warming on insect occurrence would be significant, but should vary depending on the biological characters of the insects.",0
"The Indian subcontinent is one of the most intensely irrigated regions of the world and state of the art climate models do not account for the representation of irrigation. Sensitivity studies with the regional climate model REMO show distinct feedbacks between the simulation of the monsoon circulation with and without irrigation processes. We find that the temperature and mean sea level pressure, where the standard REMO version without irrigation shows a significant bias over the areas of Indus basin, is highly sensitive to the water used for irrigation. In our sensitivity test we find that removal of this bias has caused less differential heating between land and sea masses. This in turns reduces the westerlies entering into land from Arabian Sea, hence creating conditions favorable for currents from Bay of Bengal to intrude deep into western India and Pakistan that have been unrealistically suppressed before. We conclude that the representation of irrigated water is unavoidable for realistic simulation of south Asian summer monsoon and its response under global warming. Citation: Saeed, F., S.

"Together with La Reunion and Mayotte Islands, Scattered Islands make up French Indian Ocean Territories (FIOT) which all possess highly ecologically sensitive natural habitats of major value for migrant species (turtles, seabirds, mannuals). As a contribution to the national action plan of IFRECOR (French initiative on coral reefs) we set up during the period 2002-2005 a survey and monitoring program in order to increase the knowledge of the still poorly known coral reefs of these islands scattered from North to South in the Mozarnbique Channel and in central Indian Ocean. Results were particularly focused on the geomorphological mapping of shallow marine habitats and on a structural and functional approach of fish, coral and mollusc communities. Additional approaches with rapid assessment methods remained non exhaustive but neverthe less allow a first integrated diagnosis of the patrimonial value of the coral sanctuaries of Scattered Islands and to propose decision-making tools for identifying applied and fundamental axes of research as well as actions of monitoring adapted particularly to vulnerability factors and global warming.",0
" In this work, we use computational chemistry at the B3LYP/ 6 - 31g* level of theory combined with Pinnock's cloudy sky instantaneous radiative transfer model to predict radiative forcing for hydrofluoroether compounds. We validate our predictive ability using the 27 values of cloudy sky radiative forcing reported in the literature before populating a database of 25 other hydrofluoroethers where no radiative forcing data is available. These additional compounds were selected because kinetic data are available for them and one could predict global warming potentials using the work reported here.",0
"We developed a new design photobioreactor incorporating Chlorella sp. for removal of CO2 in stack gas. Photosynthetic conversion of CO2 into Chlorella biomass was investigated in a photobioreactor, which we termed a cone-shaped helical tubular photobioreactor. The laboratory scale photobioreactor (0.48 m high X 0.57 m top diameter) was set up with a 0.255 m(2) installation area. The photostage was made from transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing (6 cm internal diameter with 2 cm wall thickness and 27 m in length). The inner surface of the cone-shaped photostage (0.50 m(2)) was illuminated with a metal halide lamp, the energy input into the photostage[photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm)] was 2127 KJ day(-1) (12 h day / 12 h night). The maximum daily photosynthetic efficiency was 5.67% (PAR) under an air-lift operation at a flow rate of 0.3 litre min(-1) 10% CO2 enriched air. Maximum increase of Chlorella biomass was 25 g dry biomass m(-2) (installation area) day(-1) or 0.68 g dry biomass litre medium(-1) day(-1). Also, a helical tubular photobioreactor for outdoor culture was constructed with a 1 m(2) installation area (2 m top diameter) and photosynthetic productivity was investigated in July, 1996.

"Owing to concerns about energy security and because of increased environmental awareness, the biofuel industry is expanding worldwide. it is therefore extremely important to be able to quantify the sustainability of biofuels in order to determine their benefits over using conventional fossil fuel derived transport fuels. This study investigates the total energy requirement and global warming potential (GWP) of the production of biodiesel from oilseed rape in the UK, using life cycle analyses. Large- and small-scale productions are compared and the sensitivity of these environmental impacts to production variables investigated. Possible changes to the processes are considered, with a view to reduce the energy requirement and global warming potential. This research shows that the scale of the production of biodiesel from oilseed rape in the UK, and the transport involved in the various stages of manufacture, has little effect on its global warming potential. It is also shown that if the rape meal and glycerol were combusted in combined heat and power plants, and the rate of application of nitrogenous fertiliser were reduced from 211 kg/ha to 100 kg/ha, the energy requirement and global warming potential savings from using biodiesel rather than ultra low sulphur diesel would increase dramatically, to 170% and 120%, respectively, on a basis of equivalent net energy content.

"Spatial variability that occurs at large scales has long been used by ecologists as a tool to examine the controls over ecosystem structure and function. Correlations of control variables such as climatic factors and response variables such as vegetation and soil carbon storage across broad regions have played a crucial role in predicting the response of ecosystems to global climate change. Despite the importance of these large-scale space-for-time substitutions, there are substantial limitations. One of these limitations is that many of the possible control factors covary with one another, and only some of the important control factors actually exist in large-scale databases. Thus, the true proximal controls may be difficult to identify. A second limitation is that models of spatial variability may not be appropriately applied to temporal variability. In this paper, we utilize a new approach to determine the extent to which N availability may constrain aboveground primary productivity in the Central Grassland region of the U.S. The strong relationship between average annual primary production and average annual precipitation found in spatial patterns in ecosystems globally has often been interpreted as evidence of a fundamental water limitation. However, temporal variation in annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) indicates that other factors constrain production. We generated a spatial and temporal database for annual aboveground net primary production and annual net N mineralization by linking a database of input variables (precipitation, temperature, and soils) with predictive models. We generated independent data sets of aboveground net primary production and net N mineralization by using regression models to predict aboveground net primary production, and the Century model to simulate net N mineralization. Our analyses indicate that net primary production and net N mineralization both increase with mean annual precipitation; thus, it is not possible to separate the extent to which ANPP is controlled by water or N availability. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) increased with increasing precipitation across the region. Aboveground net primary production decreased with increasing temperature across the region, while N mineralization increased slightly, leading to decreasing (NUE) with increasing temperature. At high precipitation levels, aboveground net primary production increased and N mineralization decreased slightly with increasing soil fineness. Nitrogen use efficiency generally increased with increasing pools of soil organic matter, likely because in grasslands, the proportion of recalcitrant organic matter increases with the total organic matter pools. A comparison of interannual variation in net N mineralization with average spatial variation indicated a high degree of inertia in the response of N availability to precipitation levels. Our simulation results as well as field results of Lauenroth and Sala (1992) raise important questions about the applicability of space-for-time substitutions when dealing with ecosystem function. The structure of the systems appears to provide important constraints on the temporal variability that are not evident in an analysis of spatial variability.",0
"Filamentous cyanobacteria are unsuitable food for Daphnia due to their poor manageability, poor nutritional value and, in some cases, toxicity. As the strength of harmful effects of cyanobacteria on filter-feeding zooplankton is temperature dependent, the global warming scenarios for eutrophic lakes in temperate zone might include an escalated suppression of Daphnia populations caused by the presence of cyanobacterial filaments. To test this assumption, we conducted life-table experiments with four clones of Daphnia magna fed either a green alga Scenedesmus obliquus or a non-toxic strain of filamentous cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in two temperatures (20 degrees C and 24 degrees C). Key life history parameters of Daphnia. i.e., age and size at first reproduction, fecundity, and individual growth rate, were measured. Both food and temperature significantly affected Daphnia performance, however, the effect of interaction of these two factors was ambiguous and highly genotype-dependent. We conclude that the temperature increase within the studied range will not necessarily, strengthen the suppression of Daphnia growth by filamentous cyanobacteria, but may affect clonal selection within population of Daphnia. thus possibly triggering microevolutionary changes within affected populations.",0
"The impact of climate warming on Swiss building energy demand was investigated by means of the degree-days method. A procedure to estimate heating degree-days (HDD) and cooling degree-days (CDD) from monthly temperature data was developed, tested and applied to four representative Swiss locations. Past trends were determined from homogenized temperature data for the period 1901-2003. The range of possible future trends for the 21st century was assessed based on 41 regional climate change scenarios derived from 35 simulations with 8 global climate models. During 1901-2003, the HDD were found to have decreased by 11-18%, depending on the threshold temperature (8, 10 or 12 degrees C) and location. For the period 1975-2085, the scenario calculations suggested a further decrease between 13% and 87%. For CDD, accelerating positive trends were found during the 20th and 21st centuries. The HDD showed the largest absolute and the CDD the largest relative sensitivity to warming (albeit starting from relatively low levels). Weather data currently used for building design increasingly lead to an overestimation of heating and underestimation of cooling demand in buildings and, thus, require periodic adaptation. Projections were particularly sensitive to the choice of temperature scenario. Nevertheless, they suggest for the next decades significant, seasonally and regionally variable shifts in the energy consumption of Swiss buildings that deserve further study. In particular, greater attention needs to be paid in future to the summer thermal behaviour of buildings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"We present gravitationally self-consistent predictions of sea level change that would follow the disappearance of either the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) or marine sectors of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). Our predictions are based on a state-of-the-art pseudo-spectral sea level algorithm that incorporates deformational, gravitational and rotational effects on sea level, as well as the migration of shorelines due to both local sea-level variations and changes in the extent of marine-based ice cover. If we define the effective eustatic value (EEV) as the geographically uniform rise in sea level once all marine-based sectors have been filled with water, then we find that some locations can experience a sea level rise that is similar to 40 per cent higher than the EEV. This enhancement is due to the migration of water away from the zone of melting in response to the loss of gravitational attraction towards the ice sheet (load self-attraction), the expulsion of water from marine areas as these regions rebound due to the unloading, and the feedback into sea level of a contemporaneous perturbation in Earth rotation. In the WAIS case, this peak enhancement is twice the value predicted in a previous projection that did not include expulsion of water from exposed marine-sectors of the West Antarctic or rotational feedback. The peak enhancements occur over the coasts of the United States and in the Indian Ocean in the WAIS melt scenario, and over the south Atlantic and northwest Pacific in the EAIS scenario. We conclude that accurate projections of the sea level hazard associated with ongoing global warming should be based on a theory that includes the complete suite of physical processes described above.",0
"Semantic difference s have led to a gap in the understanding of the impacts of climate change on precipitation frequency estimates. There is popular perception that heavy rainfalls have become more frequent, and that this trend will increase with global warming. Most of the literature examines this question from the point of view of climatology using definitions of ""heavy,'' ""very heavy,'' or ""extreme'' rainfall, which are different from those commonly used by civil engineers. This article identifies the differences in meaning used by the climate and civil engineering communities and examines trends in the observed record in the frequency of exceedances ( not trends in magnitudes). Using concepts recognized as the basis for design of the Nation's civil infrastructure, we look at trends in the number of exceedances of thresholds for a variety of precipitation frequencies and event durations used by civil engineers. We found that the estimated trends in exceedances at one-day and multiday durations were statistically significant and increasing for the Ohio River Basin and surrounding states but the reverse was true for the Semiarid Southwest (i.e., not significant and decreasing trends). In addition, we found the magnitude of the trends was small for all but the more frequent events and also small with respect to the uncertainty associated with the precipitation frequency estimates themselves.",0
"We investigated aquatic plant diversity by conducting the field investigation and collecting the published data in the arid regions of Northwest China. Two hundred and twenty four taxa of vascular aquatic plants representing 64 genera and 34 families occur in this area, 8.48% of which are endemic. Among these, 1 genus and 6 species were new state records and 1 family, 9 genera and 29 species were new area records. Typhaceae, Potamogetonaceae, Juncaginaceae and Haloragaceae were the most frequent families (considering relative frequency of occurrence), whereas Cyperaceae, Potamogetonaceae and Ranuncnlaceae are the most species-rich. The most frequent genera were Typha, Potamogeton, and Triglochin, and the most species-rich were Potamogeton, Eleocharis and Scirpus. The most frequent species are Triglochin palustre, Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton pectinatus and Typha angustifolia. Aquatic plants diversity is distributed unevenly in the region. The maximum species occurs in Dzungarian basin while the least species in Hexi corridor. The aquatic flora in arid zone of China is not distinctive although some endemic species are found, most species are widely distributed. Local aquatic plants diversity can be influenced by many factors such as hydrological alteration, habitat loss, over-grazing, high human population pressure, global climate change, an inappropriate economic development policy. Among them, the largest threat to aquatic plants biodiversity may be habitat loss due to hydrological alteration. In order to conserve the aquatic plants biological resources and biodiversity in this region, some strategies and measures must be suggested including strengthening scientific research and biodiversity education in the local people, balancing economic development and ecological conservation, and enhancing governmental assistance and subsidy to the local residents.",0
"Several soil organic matter (SOM) methodologies have been employed to analyze a Suite Of subsampled soils, and their results have been correlated. This will permit future comparison of the large archive of SOM databases, which widely exist in Lithuania and other Central and Eastern European countries, with those of other international Countries. Samples were collected (n = 92) from topsoil and subsoil horizons of Eutric Glassoboralfs (Eutric Albeluvisols) at five long-term monitoring sites (three sites with 8 years' duration and two sites with 20 years' duration) containing a total of 46 experimental field plots. Each soil sample was subsampled and SOM determined by several analytical approaches (namely, dry combustion, Walkley-Black, Tyurin photometric, Tyurin titrimetric, and loss-on-ignition methods). Correlation coefficients between multiple sets of results varied between r = 0.831 and r = 0.965 (n = 92, P < 0.001). Based on the strength and significance of these relationships, we propose that simple linear regression equations can be confidently employed to recalculate SOM data among various analytical methodologies and thus help resolve the issue of international data comparison.",0
"This study investigates the elevation dependency of the present-day climate and future climate change in temperature and precipitation over Korea. A dynamically downscaled fine-scale climate simulation (20 km) shows reasonable agreement with two types of observations maintained by the Korea Meteorological Administration. The model exactly captures the strong relationship between the elevation and local climatology as seen in observed temperature and precipitation patterns. The behavior of the elevation dependency shown by the present-day climate simulation is also appeared in the climate change signal. The warming amplification is highly correlated with elevation. The warming is more pronounced at higher elevations than at lower elevations during winter, and maximum warming occurs at minimum temperature, showing an asymmetric response between minimum and maximum temperature. A noticeable differential rate of winter warming in response to the elevation can be explained by the snow-albedo feedback. Precipitation and snow changes also show the relevant topographical modulation under global warming. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of a refined topography for improving the accuracy of the local climatology and suitably reflecting the altitudinal distribution.",0
"Analyses of streamflow, snow mass temperature and precipitation in snowmelt-dominated river basins in the western United States indicate an advance in the timing of peak spring season flows over the past 50 years. Warm temperature spells in spring have occurred much earlier in recent years, which explains in part the trend in the timing of the spring peak flow. In addition, a decrease in snow water equivalent and a general increase in winter precipitation are evident for many stations in the western United States. It appears that in recent decades more of the precipitation is coming as rain rather than snow. The trends are strongest at lower elevations and in the Pacific Northwest region, where winter temperatures are closer to the melting point; it appears that in this region in particular, modest shifts in temperature are capable of forcing, large shifts in basin hydrologic response. It is speculated that these trends bould be potentially a manifestation of the general global warming, trend in recent decades and also due to enhanced ENSO activity. The observed trends in hydroclimatology over the western United States can have significant impacts on water resources planning and management.",0
"The analysis framework introduced in this paper utilizes the recognition that exergy is a form of environmental free energy to provide a fundamental basis for valuing environmental interactions independent from their secondary impacts (e.g., global warming, photochemical smog). In order to extend exergy to analyze environmental interactions, modifications are required to the traditional representation of the environment and definition of the dead state used in technical exergy analysis. These are accomplished through a combination of logical extensions and use of non-equilibrium thermodynamic principles. The framework is comprised of two separate components: (1) environmental exergy analysis and (2) anthropocentric sensitivity analysis. Environmental exergy analysis is based on fundamental thermodynamic principles and analysis techniques. It extends the principles of technical exergy analysis to the environment in order to quantify the locations, magnitudes, and types of environmental impact state change, alteration of natural transfers, and destruction change. Anthropocentric sensitivity analysis is based on the concepts of anthropocentric value and anthropocentric sensitivity. It enables the results of environmental exergy analysis to be interpreted for decision making, but at the expense of introducing some subjectivity into the framework. A key attribute of the framework is its ability to evaluate and compare the environmental performance of energy systems on a level playing field, regardless of the specifics of the systems-resources, by-products, sizes, time scales.

"The paper presents the use of indicators in a site-specific assessment method for strategic environmental assessment in regional land use planning (here: SEA-REP). It is explained with the example of the state of environment indicator 'LUCCA 4 Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding', how SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change. The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption, land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described. Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood risk.

"The state of Ceara, located in semiarid northeastern Brazil, suffers under irregularly recurring droughts that go along with water scarcity. Structural policies to control and reduce water scarcity, as water supply and demand management, should be seen as long-term planning, and thus must consider climate change and regional development. To this end, the present research proposes a model-based global change scenario. Water stress is assessed for 184 municipalities in Ceara between 2001 and 2025. For this purpose, four global change scenarios are developed, considering both global climate change and the effects of development policies. Climatic, hydrological, and water use models are applied and a proposed index computed for identification of long-term water stress. Application of the methodology in the focus area shows that, if no effective intervention measures are taken, up to almost 60 percent of the municipalities of the state may suffer under long-term water scarcity by 2025. On average, municipalities in the state of Ceara have a water shortage probability for the next 25 years ranging from 9 percent to 20 percent annually, depending on the scenario. The 10 percent most stressed municipalities have a probability of over 80 percent annually of facing water scarcity in the scenario period (25 years). Results also show that a decentralized development policy can compensate for the possible severe effects of climatic trends on future water availability over the scenario period.",0
"Despite its growing environmental significance, there are no detailed historical records of atmospheric As deposition for the Northern Hemisphere. Having overcome the severe analytical challenges in measuring As in polar ice, and using an Arctic ice core representing similar to 16 ka of snow accumulation, we present a complete record of atmospheric As deposition for this period which reveals significant contamination beginning 3000 years ago. While Pb enrichments unequivocally increased threefold above natural background levels during Greek/Phoenician, Roman, and Medieval periods, As is elevated by a factor of 5. Previous studies showed that these periods are not only enriched in Pb but also Sb: here we show significant contamination not only by As but also Bi, Cu, and Zn. The Pb isotope data reveal declines in the ratio (206)Pb/(207)Pb which reflects the introduction Pb-bearing aerosols from smelting of lead ores, but the metallurgy of copper ores must also have played a role. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a deeper, broader environmental significance of sulphide ore processing in antiquity, defining the origins of global atmospheric contamination for a suite of related elements and providing a new perspective on the start of the Anthropocene. In addition, the data indicate that by far the greatest As concentrations in the ice core are recorded during the Younger Dryas cold climate event centered around 12 ka B. P., demonstrating the strong link between global climate change and the atmospheric cycling of trace elements.",0
"The northwestern North Pacific is considered to be one of the most productive areas in the global ocean. Although the marginal zones along the Japanese and Kuril islands, Kamchatka Peninsula, and Aleutian Islands are certainly productive, recent studies do not always show high primary production values in the western subarctic gyre (WSG). In addition, a recent analysis of the biological pump in the WSG showed that, in contrast to what was previously reported, the vertical change of the particulate organic carbon flux with depth is large. Nevertheless, the biological pump in the northwestern North Pacific may function to draw down the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface water because the ratio of the organic carbon flux to inorganic carbon flux (C-or/C-inorg), the export flux, and the export ratio from the surface water are higher than those in other oceans. This article also introduces recent research on changes to the biological pump that might have been caused by global warming.",0
"Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is environmental evaluation of products, materials, and processes over their life cycle. Truncation uncertainty and corresponding uncertainty are main problems occurred in process life cycle assessment (PLCA) modeling and economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIOLCA) modeling. Through combination of these two modelings in different life cycle stage and use of an uncertainty reduction strategy, a hybrid life cycle assessment modeling method was proposed in this study. Case studies were presented on gasoline powered motorbikes (M-bike) and electricity-powered electric bike (E-bike). Web-based software was developed to analyze process environmental impacts. Results show that the largest part of life cycle energy (LCE) is consumed at use stage. Less energy is consumed in life cycle of E-bike than that of M-bike. GWP (Global Warming Potential), CO (Carbon Monoxide), PM10 (particulate matter) emission of M-bike are higher than that of E-bike, especially at use stage, AP (acidification Potential) emission of E-bike is higher than that of M-bike. Comprehensively, E-bike is energy efficient and less emitting, and better choice for urban private transportation.",0
"Soil freeze thaw cycles (FTC) influence nutrient cycling, but their consequences for productivity and composition of vegetation are not well investigated. Ongoing global warming will increase the recurrence of FTC in cool-temperate and high-latitude regions. Here, we report on the above- and belowground biomass production as well as the nitrogen nutrition of two common vegetation types, grassland and heath, after more frequent FTC in a controlled field experiment in Central Europe. Furthermore, we analyze the duration of the observed effects. Five FTC were induced by buried heating wires in addition to three naturally occurring FTC during winter 2005/06. More frequent FTC significantly increased aboveground production of experimental grassland early in the following growing season. However, no reaction was found for experimental heath within the first growing season. Biomass production of heath communities dropped significantly and C/N ratio increased in the freeze thaw treated plots in the second year after the manipulation, whereas production in the grassland communities was no longer affected significantly, except for an increase in C/N ratio. This response can at least partly be explained by changes in nutrient availability, as plant available nitrate increased in the manipulated grassland plots and decreased in the manipulated heath plots. The results show the high ecological importance of climate changes during winter, with the outcomes differing strongly between contrasting vegetation types. Furthermore, we show that short term climatic events can cause long-lasting effects, sometimes emerging in the vegetation only after considerable time lags (here: one growing season).

"Species from many different habitats are responding to recent climate change. Mountainous areas are of particular interest as they provide pronounced gradients and have experienced above-average temperature increases. Data from the beginning of the 20th century of both the upper and lower range limits of plants of the European Alps were updated a century later and analyzed in order to identify common trends and deviating patterns of shifts at opposing ends of species' ranges. At the upper limit, there was a strong trend towards an increase in species richness per summit, including 33 species that were recorded for the first time on any of the investigated summit areas. The species experienced a consistent upward shift exceeding 100 elevational meters, and 49 out of the 125 investigated species shifted upwards to a present altitude which is higher than any reported occurrence in the region one century ago. The response at the lower range limit was more heterogeneous and suggests species-specific differences in responsiveness and response patterns. With this approach of the combined analysis of upper and lower range limits along elevational gradients, it is possible to identify candidate species that might not keep pace with climate change, and thus, might face an increased risk of extinction with continued global warming.",0
"Dramatic changes are taking place in the glacier-covered high mountains of Africa. The glacial area on Mt Kilimanjaro is now only half as large as it was in the 1970s. The Tyndall Glacier on Mt Kenya, which retreated at approximately 3 m/yr from 1958 to 1997, retreated at about 10 m/yr from 1997 to 2002. Pioneer species such as Senecio keniophytum, Arabis alpina, mosses, lichen, and Agrostis trachyphylla have advanced over areas formerly covered by the glacier. The rate at which this vegetation migrated up the former bed of the glacier (2.1-4.6 m/yr from 1958 to 1997) is similar to the rate of glacial retreat (2.9 m/yr). In the interval from 1997 to 2002, pioneer species advanced at a rapid rate of 6.4-12.2 m/yr, while the glacier retreated at 9.8 m/yr. Rapid glacial retreat has been accompanied by rapid colonization by plants. Pioneer species improve soil conditions and make habitat suitable for other plants. If warming continues, alpine plant cover may extend all the way to mountain summits, and then eventually diminish as trees colonize the areas formerly occupied by alpine plants. Larger woody plants such as Senecio keniodendron and Lobelia telekii, which showed no obvious advance prior to 1997, have advanced quickly since that year.",0
"Hurricane Mitch is considered as one of the strongest Atlantic storms of the past century. Due to its extraordinary quasi-stationary position over three days (27. 10. by 29.10.1998) offshore between the northern coast of Honduras and the Island of Guanaja, this area was struck most violently. The stud), deals with the degree of destruction, the impacts (negative ones as well as positive ones) and the locally different trajectories of regeneration seven years after the disturbance event for the three most important ecosystems on Guanaja: pine forests, mangroves and coral reefs. As a consequence of global warming an increase of hurricane frequency and intensity is predicted by some climate models for the Caribbean, making a better understanding of hurricane effects on these sensitive ecosystems of particular interest.",0
"There is increasing evidence that the global climate change is already having measurable biological impacts. However, no study (based on actual data) has assessed the influence of the global warming on communities in rivers. We analyzed long-term series of fish (1979-1999) and invertebrate (1980-1999) data from the Upper Rhone River at Bugey to test the influence of climatic warming on both communities. Between the periods of 1979-1981 and 1997-1999, the average water temperature of the Upper Rhone River at Bugey has increased by about 5degreesC due to atmospheric warming. In the same period, several dams have been built from 12.5 to 85 km upstream of our study segment and a nuclear power plant has been built on it. Changes in the community structure were summarized using multivariate analysis. The variability of fish abundance was correlated with discharge and temperature during the reproduction period (April-June): low flows and high temperatures coincided with high fish abundance. Beyond abundance patterns, southern, thermophilic fish species (e.g. chub, and barbel) as well as downstream, thermophilic invertebrate taxa (e.g. Athricops, Potamopyrgus) progressively replaced northern, cold-water fish species (e.g. dace) and upstream, cold-water invertebrate taxa (e.g. Chloroperla, Protoneumura). These patterns were significantly correlated with thermal variables, suggesting that shifts were the consequences of climatic warming. All analyses were carried out using statistics appropriate for autocorrelated time series. Our results were consistent with previous studies dealing with relationships between fish or invertebrates and water temperature, and with predictions of the impact of climatic change on freshwater communities. The potential confounding factors (i.e. dams and the nuclear power plant) did not seem to influence the observed trends.",0
"This paper assesses the production, consumption and store of organic carbon in the agricultural system, including all products from agriculture, of China. An estimation showed that about 90% of carbon uptake by agricultural systems would be emitted or returned to the atmosphere by several types from 1990 to 2000, others remain in durable agricultural products and soil. Even though the fixation rate is getting lower, generally speaking Chinese agriculture is a ''sink'' but not a ''source'' in respect to the atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations in both the current period and that after few decades. China's Soil stores 12% of the whole soil carbon in the World. Considering the different global warming potentials (GWP), an approach to the country budgets of CO2 and CH4 has been presented based on the measurements in rice paddies and in the Tibet and Inner Mongolia grasslands.",0
"The Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata has recently expanded its range northwards and upwards in the UK, consistent with the hypothesis that this cold-sensitive species has responded to a warming climate. We interrogated distribution data, collected during four national surveys of this species between 1974 and 2006, to assess whether this large-scale range expansion has been accompanied by finer-scale changes in topographic characteristics of breeding locations. Within sites occupied in successive surveys, there was some evidence of limited altitudinal expansion between surveys. Within wider landscapes occupied in successive surveys, the preceding winter climate tended to be harsher at newly colonized sites than at sites that had already been occupied in the previous survey, while territories in newly colonized sites also tended to be on steeper slopes, especially if at higher altitude, and (in 1994 only) to be more south-facing. Territories in sites that had already been occupied in the previous survey tended to be lower altitude, less steep and more north-facing than territories in newly colonized landscapes. In 2006 only, the winter climate was significantly milder in newly colonized landscapes than in already occupied sites. The combined effects of a changing climate and topography may have influenced the pattern of in-filling in the existing range, while colonization of distant areas, especially more latterly, may have been facilitated by a combination of increased dispersal pressure from the existing range and warming of climate which made higher altitude habitat in the new areas more suitable for occupancy. Careful consideration needs to be given to the importance of fine-scale topographical variation in determining species' responses to climate change in order to underpin robust adaptation strategies.",0
"The North Brazil Current (NBC) connects the North and South Atlantic and is the major pathway for the surface return flow of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Here, we calculate the NBC geostrophic transport time series based on 5 decades of observations near the western boundary off the coast of Brazil. Results reveal a multidecadal NBC variability that lags Labrador Sea deep convection by a few years. The NBC transport time series is coherent with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in sea surface temperature, which also has been widely linked to AMOC fluctuations in previous modeling studies. Our results thus suggest that the observed multidecadal NBC transport variability is a useful indicator for AMOC variations. The suggested connection between the NBC and AMOC is assessed in a 700 year control simulation of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's CM2.1 coupled climate model. The model results are in agreement with observations and further demonstrate that the variability of NBC transport is a good index for tracking AMOC variations. Concerning the debate about whether a slowdown of AMOC has already occurred under global warming, the observed NBC transport time series suggests strong multidecadal variability but no significant trend.",0
"Global carbon (C) reserves in soil are large compared with atmospheric stocks (in the form of CO2 and methane), so small changes in soil C storage will have a significant effect on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In order to better understand the consequences of global climate change, it is essential that we define how soil C storage is influenced by changes in temperature and moisture that are expected as a result of global climate change, Forest floor carbon pools and fluxes were evaluated at 16 northern hardwood sites located within four distinct climate regions (Northern, Central, Southern and Coastal) in Maine. Mean annual air temperature at the sites ranged from 2.0 degrees C in the Northern region to 6.2 degrees C in the Coastal region and average annual precipitation ranged from 90 cm in the Northern region to 140 cm in the Coastal region. Leaf litter mass and leaf litter C flux were not correlated with temperature indices and did not vary among regions, However, they were positively correlated with annual precipitation, suggesting that litter production was controlled, in part at least, by precipitation but not by temperature. Northern sites stored more C in the forest floor than Coastal sites, and they experienced slower decomposition rates. Because soil and vegetation characteristics of these sites were similar, we attribute these trends to differences in climate, Indeed, C turnover time was correlated with latitude and temperature indices, Slower decomposition in the Northern region was attributed to a combination of lower specific activity at temperatures below 13 degrees C, cooler average temperatures and a shorter frost-free season. Soil respiration at each site was positively correlated with temperature and the slope of the relationship increased with latitude, indicating that the ability of the soil biota to respire C varied with climate, A predictive equation is presented that accounts for the change in slope with latitude. Because C loss through soil respiration was more sensitive to temperature than C inputs from litter, any regional warming in the next century may lead to a decrease in forest floor carbon storage, However, if precipitation increases with temperature, then litter C flux may increase and offset the increase in soil respiration.",0
" Climate is changing. Predictions are for at least a 3 degreesC rise in mean temperature in northern Europe over the next century. Existing severe impacts of nutrients and inappropriate fish stocking in freshwater systems remain. 2. Effects of warming by 3 degreesC above ambient, nutrient addition and the presence or absence of sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus were studied in experimental microcosms dominated by submerged plants, mimicking shallow lake ecosystems. 3. Warming had considerably smaller effects on the phytoplankton community than did fish and nutrients. It had very minor effects on chlorophyll a and total phytoplankton biovolume. However, it significantly decreased the biovolumes of Cryptophyceae (a major component in the controls) and Dinophyceae. Contrary to expectation, warming did not increase the abundance of blue-green algae (cyanophytes). Warming decreased the abundances of Cryptomonas erosa ( Cryptophyceae) and Oocystis pusilla (Chlorophycota) and increased those of two other green algae, Tetraedron minimum and Micractinium pusillum. It had no effect on a further 17 species that were predominant in a community of about 90 species. 4. Fish and nutrients, either together or separately, generally increased the crops of most of the 21 abundant species and of the algal groups. Exceptions were for diatoms and chrysophytes, which were very minor components of the communities. Fish, but neither nutrients nor warming, increased the number of species of phytoplankton detected. This was probably through removal of zooplankton grazers, and parallels terrestrial studies where the presence of top predators, by controlling herbivores, leads to increased plant diversity. 5. There was no particular pattern in the taxonomy or biological characteristics of those species affected by the treatments. In particular, there was no link between organism size (a surrogate for many important biological features of phytoplankton species) and the effects of warming, nutrient addition or presence or absence of fish. However, all species were relatively small and potentially vulnerable to grazing. 6. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that fears of an increasing abundance of cyanophytes with current projections of global warming may be unrealized, at least in shallow unstratified lakes still dominated by macrophytes. However, they emphasize that eutrophication and fish manipulations remain very important impact factors that determine the abundance of phytoplankton and subsequent problems caused by large growths.",0
"P>We test for two critical phenomena in Amazonian ecosystems: self-organized criticality (SOC) and critical transitions. SOC is often presented in the complex systems literature as a general explanation for scale invariance in nature. In particular, this mechanism is claimed to underlie the macroscopic structure and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. These would be inextricably linked to the action of fire, which is conceived as an endogenous ecological process. We show that Amazonian savanna fires display the scale-invariant features characteristic of SOC but do not display SOC. The same is true in Amazonian rainforests subject to moderate drought. These findings prove that there are other causes of scale invariance in ecosystems. In contrast, we do find evidence of a critical transition to a megafire regime under extreme drought in rainforests; this phenomenon is likely to determine the time scale of a possible loss of Amazonian rainforest caused by climate change.",0
"The Changbaishan Nature Reserve (CNR) is the largest protected temperate forest in the world. It was established in 1960 to protect the virgin Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) mixed hardwood forest, a typical temperate forest of northeast China. Studies of vascular diversity patterns on the north slope of the CNR mountainside forest (800-1700 m a.s.l.) were conducted in 1963 and in 2006. The aim of this comparison was to assess the long-term effects of the protected status on plant biodiversity during the intervening 43 years. The research was carried out in three forest types: mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest (MCBF), mixed coniferous forest (MCF), and sub-alpine coniferous forest (SCF), characterized by different dominant species. The alpha diversity indicted by species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index were found to differ for the same elevations and forest types after the 43-year interval, while the beta diversity indicated by the Cody index depicted the altitudinal patterns of plant species gain and loss. The floral compositional pattern and the diversity of vascular species were generally similar along altitudinal gradients before and after the 43-year interval, but some substantial changes were evident with the altitude gradient. In the tree layer, the dominant species in 2006 were similar to those of 1963, though diversity declined with altitude. The indices in the three forest types did not differ significantly between 1963 and 2006, and these values even increased in the MCBF and MCF. However, originally dominant species, such as Pinus koraiensis, tended to decline, the proportion of broad-leaved trees increased, and the species turnover in the succession layers showed a trend to shift to higher altitudes. The diversity pattern of the understory fluctuated along the altitudinal gradient due to micro-environmental variations. A comparison of the alpha diversity indices among the three forest types reveals that the diversity of the shrub and herb layer decreased, and some rare and medicinal species disappeared. Meteorological records show that climate has changed significantly in this 43-year intervening period, and information collected from another field survey found that the most severe human disturbances to the CNR forests stemmed from the exploitation of Ginseng roots and Korean pine nuts.",0
"Although recent studies suggest that climate change may substantially accelerate the rate of species loss in the biosphere, only a few studies have focused on the potential consequences of a spatial reorganization of biodiversity with global warming. Here, we show a pronounced latitudinal increase in phytoplanktonic and zooplanktonic biodiversity in the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean in recent decades. We also show that this rise in biodiversity paralleled a decrease in the mean size of zooplanktonic copepods and that the reorganization of the planktonic ecosystem toward dominance by smaller organisms may influence the networks in which carbon flows, with negative effects on the downward biological carbon pump and demersal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Our study suggests that, contrary to the usual interpretation of increasing biodiversity being a positive emergent property promoting the stability/resilience of ecosystems, the parallel decrease in sizes of planktonic organisms could be viewed in the North Atlantic as reducing some of the services provided by marine ecosystems to humans.",0
"Increasing ocean temperatures due to global warming are predicted to have negative effects on coral reef fishes. El Nino events are associated with elevated water temperatures at large spatial (1000s of km) and temporal (annual) scales, providing environmental conditions that enable temperature effects on reef fishes to be tested directly. We compared remote sensing data of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, surface current flow and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration with monthly patterns in larval supply of coral reef fishes in nearshore waters around Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia) from January 1996 to March 2000. This time included an intense El Nino (April 1997-May 1998) event between two periods of La Nina (January-March 1996 and August 1998-March 2000) conditions. There was a strong relationship between the timing of the El Nino event, current flow, ocean productivity (as measured by Chl-a) and larval supply. In the warm conditions of the event, there was an increase in the SST anomaly index up to 3.5 degrees C above mean values and a decrease in the strength of the westward surface current toward the reef. These conditions coincided with low concentrations of Chl-a (mean: 0.06 mg m-3, SE +/- 0.004) and a 51% decline in larval supply from mean values. Conversely, during strong La Nina conditions when SST anomalies were almost 2 degrees C below mean values and there was a strong westward surface current, Chl-a concentration was 150% greater than mean values and larval supply was 249% greater. A lag in larval supply suggested that productivity maybe affecting both the production of larvae by adults and larval survival. Our results suggest that warming temperatures in the world's oceans will have negative effects on the reproduction of reef fishes and survival of their larvae within the plankton, ultimately impacting on the replenishment of benthic populations.",0
"This study investigates whether the diurnal temperature cycle affects the geothermal regime on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. To separately characterize this effect, the impact of climatic warming on the ground's thermal regime is eliminated by setting the global warming rate to 0 degrees C/year. The diurnal temperature cycle at the natural ground surface is denoted as sinusoidal functions with amplitudes of 0, 5, 8, and 12 degrees C, respectively. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was utilized to compute the geo-temperature under the natural ground surface, eliminating the effect of geometric boundaries, such as the roadway's embankment, on the geothermal regime. The results show that the diurnal temperature cycle does affect the geothermal regime as (1) under the same mean annual ground temperature, the higher diurnal temperature fluctuation amplitude (DTFA) on the ground surface, the thinner the active layer; (2) the higher the DTFA, the colder the underlying soil. An analysis of the heat flow at the ground surface showed that the diurnal temperature cycle resulted in a net negative heat balance at the earth's surface. This heat loss induced by the diurnal temperature cycle cools the underlying soil. The results and analysis suggest that, currently, the documented numerical model which ignores the diurnal temperature cycle overestimates the warming of the underlying soil. This overestimation, if the DTFA at ground surface is 12 degrees C, would be up to 0.4 degrees C. Considering that pavement surface usually undergoes high diurnal temperature cycles, the impact of the DTFA on pavement subgrade's frost conditions and on the pavement deformation is simply discussed.

"Aim Aquatic-terrestrial ecotones are vulnerable to climate change, and degradation of the emergent aquatic macrophyte zone would have severe ecological consequences for freshwater, wetland and terrestrial ecosystems. Our aim was to uncover future changes in boreal emergent aquatic macrophyte zones by modelling the occurrence and percentage cover of emergent aquatic vegetation under different climate scenarios in Finland by the 2050s. Location Finland, northern Europe. Methods Data derived from different GIS sources were used to estimate future emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions in all catchments in Finland (848 in total). We used generalized additive models (GAM) with a full stepwise selection algorithm and Akaike information criterion to explore the main environmental determinates (climate and geomorphology) of emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions, which were derived from the national subclass of CORINE land-cover classification. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was cross-validated, using percentage of explained deviance and the area under the curve derived from the receiver-operating characteristic plots. Results Our results indicated that emergent aquatic macrophytes will expand their distributions northwards from the current catchments and percentage cover will increase in all of the catchments in all climate scenarios. Growing degree-days was the primary determinant affecting distributions of emergent aquatic macrophytes. Inclusion of geomorphological variables clearly improved model performance in both model exercises compared with pure climate variables. Main conclusions Emergent aquatic macrophyte distributions will expand due to climate change. Many emergent aquatic plant species have already expanded their distributions during the past decades, and this process will continue in the years 2051-80. Emergent aquatic macrophytes pose an increasing overgrowth risk for sensitive macrophyte species in boreal freshwater ecosystems, which should be acknowledged in management and conservation actions. We conclude that predictions based on GIS data can provide useful 'first-filter' estimates of changes in aquatic-terrestrial ecotones.",0
"Global warming projection experiments were conducted using a 20-km mesh global atmospheric model (the 20-km model), focusing on the change in the rain band of the East Asian summer monsoon (the Baiu rain band in Japan). To quantify the dependence of the projected change on the sea surface temperature (SST) prescribed to the 20-km model, we have taken different SSTs given by the two Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM)s of MRI-CGCM2.3.2 and MIROC(hires). In the future climate simulations, the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B emission scenario was assumed. The future climate simulations show that precipitation and its intensity increase over the Yangtze River valley of China and Western Japan. The termination of the Baiu season tends to be delayed until August. These changes were consistently found in the simulations regardless of different SSTs.",0
"Spring accumulations are valuable and rare sources for Quaternary pollen analysis and palaeoenvironmental research in South Africa. It is important to optimize their dating, which is sometimes complicated by root contamination. Thirteen new radiocarbon dates are presented from one of the most significant spring pollen sequences on which South African vegetation history is based, namely, from Wonderkrater in the Savanna Biome. Some anomalous measurements were recorded but a new chronology is proposed by excluding samples that were possibly contaminated by younger or older materials. The dating places the pollen-based vegetation history more firmly in a framework of regional and global climate change during the Late Quaternary, thereby making the information more suitable for comparison with other sequences and as vegetation data in global-change modelling.",0
"Aims To use the ecosystem on Green Mountain, Ascension Island, to illustrate aspects of ecosystem construction and function as well as possible mitigation of human caused global environmental change. Location Ascension Island, tropical south Atlantic. Main conclusions The cloud forest on Green Mountain is a man-made system that has produced a tropical forest without any coevolution between its constituent species. This has implications for the way we think about ecosystems and provides a striking example of Janzen's idea of 'ecological fitting'. This system provides ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, and illustrates the possible role of man-made ecosystems in the mitigation of global warming.",0
"Patterns of ecotypic variation constitute some of the few 'rules' known to modern biology. Here, we examine several well-known ecogeographical rules, especially those pertaining to body size in contemporary, historical and fossil taxa. We review the evidence showing that rules of geographical variation in response to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological changes through time in response to climate change. These rules hold at various time scales, ranging from contemporary to geological time scales. Patterns of body size variation in response to climate change at the individual species level may also be detected at the community level. The patterns underlying ecotypic variation are complex and highly context-dependent, reducing the 'predictive-power' of ecogeographical rules. This is especially true when considering the increasing impact of human activities on the environment. Nonetheless, ecogeographical rules may help interpret the likely influences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems. Global climate change has already influenced the body size of several contemporary species, and will likely have an even greater impact on animal communities in the future. For this reason, we highlight and emphasise the importance of museum specimens and the continued need for documenting the earth's biological diversity.",0
"Understanding the population-level impacts of climate change is critical for effectively managing ecosystems. Predators are important components of many systems because they provide top-down control of community structure. Ecological theory suggests that these species could be particularly susceptible to climate change because they generally occur at low densities and have resource-limited populations. Yet, our understanding of climate-change impacts on predators is hindered by the difficulty in assessing complex, nonlinear dynamics over the large spatial scales necessary to depict a species' general response to abiotic forcing. Here we use fur-return data to characterize population dynamics of a snow-adapted carnivore, the wolverine, across most of its North American range. Using novel modeling techniques, we simultaneously measured the impact of winter snowpack on wolverine dynamics across critical thresholds in snowpack depth and two domains of population growth. Winter snowpack declined from 1970 to 2004 in nearly the entire region studied, concordant with increases in Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies. Fur returns have declined in many areas; our models show that snowpack has strong, nonlinear effects on wolverine population dynamics. Importantly, wolverine harvests dropped the fastest in areas where snowpack declined most rapidly and also where snowpack had the greatest effect on population dynamics. Moreover, declining snow cover appears to drive trends in wolverine population synchrony, with important implications for overall persistence. These results illustrate the vulnerability and complex responses of predator populations to climate change. We also suggest that declining snowpack may be an important and hitherto little-analyzed mechanism through which climate change alters high-latitude ecosystems.",0
"Two newly developed instruments were combined to analyze the trace metal content in size separated arctic aerosols during the measurement campaign ASTAR 2004 (Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosols, Clouds and Radiation 2004) at Spitsbergen in May-June 2004. The aim of this extensive aerosol measurement campaign was to obtain a database for model-calculations of arctic aerosol, which play an important role in the global climate change. The ASTAR project was centered on two aircraft measurement campaigns, scheduled from 2004 to 2005, addressing both aerosol and cloud measurements, combined with ground-based and satellite observations. In the present paper one example for the analysis of ground-based aerosol particles is described. The sampling of aerosol particles was performed in a well-known manner by impaction of the particles on cleaned graphite targets. By means of a cascade impactor eight size classes between 0.35 and 16.6 mu m aerodynamic diameters were separated. To analyze the metal content in the aerosol particles the targets were rapidly heated up to 2700 degrees C in an inductively heated vaporizer system (IHVS). An argon flow transports the vaporized sample material into the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) used as ionization source for the time of flight-mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). The simultaneous extraction of the ions from the plasma, as realized in the TOF instrument, allows to obtain the full mass spectrum of the sample during the vaporization pulse without any limitation in the number of elements detected. With optimized experimental parameters the element content in arctic aerosol particles was determined in a mass range between Li-7 and Bi-209. Comparing the size distribution of the elemental content of the aerosol particles, two different meteorological situations were verified. For calibration acidified reference solutions were placed on the cleaned target inside the IHVS. The limits of detection (LOD) for the element mass on the target range between 2 and 200 pg for the elements studied, except Na, Mg, and Cr, which are influenced by high background.

"The Mekong River delta plays an important role in the Vietnamese economy and it has been severely impacted during this century by a series of unusually large floods. In the dry season the delta is also impacted by salinity intrusion and tides. These effects have caused severe human hardship. To mitigate these impacts, a large number of engineering structures, primarily dykes and weirs, have been built in the delta in recent years and are still being built, mainly to control floods and saltwater intrusion. These control measures are still being upgraded. A GIS-linked numerical model shows that the flood levels in the delta depend on the combined impacts of high river flows in the Mekong River, storm surges, sea level rise, and the likely, future siltation of the Mekong Estuary resulting from the construction of dams in China as well as many other dams proposed throughout the remaining river catchment. The model suggests that the engineering structures in the delta increase the flow velocities in the rivers and canals, increasing bank erosion, and cause the water to be deeper in the rivers and canals. This increases flooding in the non-protected areas of the delta and increases the risk of catastrophic failure of the dykes in the protected areas. The model also predicts that a sea level rise induced by global warming will enhance flooding in the Mekong River delta in Vietnam, and that flooding may worsen in the long term as a result of estuarine siltation resulting from the construction of dams. At the scale of the Mekong River basin, a multinational water resources management plan is needed that includes the hydrological needs of the delta. At the scale of the delta, a compromise is needed between allowing some flooding necessary for agriculture and preventing catastrophic flooding to alleviate human suffering. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"The global warming factor (GWF; CO(2)-eq. tonne(-1) waste) performance of municipal waste management has been investigated for six representative European Member States: Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Poland and the United Kingdom. The study integrated European waste statistical data for 2007 in a life-cycle assessment modelling perspective. It is shown that significant GWF benefit was achieved due to the high level of energy and material recovery substituting fossil energy and raw materials production, especially in Denmark and Germany. The study showed that, despite strong regulation of waste management at European level, there are major differences in GWF performance among the member states, due to the relative differences of waste composition, type of waste management technologies available nationally, and the average performance of these technologies. It has been demonstrated through a number of sensitivity analyses that, within the national framework, key waste management technology parameters can influence drastically the national GWF performance of waste management.",0
"Catenicella paradoxa sp. nov. is described from Mediterranean shallow bottoms. Colonies are small, rooted, erect and articulated, each segment either sterile unizooidal or bizooidal, or fertile bizooidal. Basal parts consist of an ""articulated basal complex"", sometimes related to thick encrusting tubes, invariably followed by morphologically ordinary zooids belonging to each type of segment. The hypotheses of small separate colonies or subcolonies from a network of encrusting tubes are discussed, but relationships with the substratum remain unclear. The species represents the first known Mediterranean catenicellid, a family taxon with a warm, mostly Australasian present-day distribution. Nevertheless, catenicellids and Catenicella species have a long history in the European area from the Middle Eocene to the Early Pleistocene, with at least four different species. In this context, the meaning of C. paradoxa sp. nov. is discussed, bearing in mind problems of species spreading in relation to global warming and human activities.",0
"Oceanic productivity, fishery yields and the net marine sequestration of atmospheric greenhouse gases are all controlled by the structure and function of planktonic communities. Detailed paleoceanographic studies have documented abrupt changes in these processes over timescales ranging from centuries to millennia. Most of these major shifts in oceanic productivity and biodiversity are attributable to changes in Earth's climate, manifested through large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions. By comparison, contemporary biodiversity and plankton community dynamics are generally considered to be ""static"", in part due to the lack of a suitable time frame of reference, and the absence of oceanic data to document ecosystem change over relatively short timescales (decades to centuries). Here we show that the average concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a) and the estimated rates of primary production in the surface waters of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) off Hawaii have more than doubled while the concentrations of dissolved silicate and phosphate have decreased during the past three decades. These changes are accompanied by an increase in the concentration of chl b, suggesting a shift in phytoplankton community structure. We hypothesize that these observed ecosystem trends and other related biogeochemical processes in the upper portion of the NPSG are manifestations of plankton community succession in response to climate variations. The hypothesized photosynthetic population ""domain shift"" toward an ecosystem dominated by prokaryotes has altered nutrient flux pathways and affected food web structure, new and export production processes, and fishery yields. Further stratification of the surface ocean resulting from global warming could lead to even more enhanced selection pressures and additional changes in biogeochemical dynamics.

"Global warming and climatic changes can lead to sea level rise (SLR) of dozens of cms over up-coming decades, along with groundwater permanent reserve losses (PRL). This study focuses on understanding the processes and estimating groundwater losses. A case study for such phenomena is Israel's Coastal aquifer. PRL estimation methodology is based upon a simple hydrogeological conceptual model. The results lead to estimation of two main components of an aquifer's PRL, and to key factors that can enhance or mitigate these losses. Such recommended measures as high-resolution topographic mapping and improved monitoring of sea level have been noted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Monthly surface temperature records from 1979 to 2000 were obtained from 218 individual stations in 93 countries and a linear trend coefficient determined for each site. This vector of trends was regressed on measures of local climate, as well as indicators of local economic activity (income, gross domestic product [GDP] growth rates, coal use) and data quality. The spatial pattern of trends is shown to be significantly correlated with non-climatic factors, including economic activity and sociopolitical characteristics of the region. The analysis is then repeated on the corresponding Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) gridded data, and very similar correlations appear, despite previous attempts to remove non-climatic effects. The socioeconomic effects in the data are shown to add up to a net warming bias, although more precise estimation of its magnitude will require further research.",0
"A catastrophic extinction occurred at the end of the Permian Period. However, baseline extinction rates appear to have been elevated even before the final catastrophe, suggesting sustained environmental degradation. For terrestrial vertebrates during the Late Permian, the combination of a drop in atmospheric oxygen plus climate warming would have induced hypoxic stress and consequently compressed altitudinal ranges to near sea level. Our simulations suggest that the magnitude of altitudinal compression would have forced extinctions by reducing habitat diversity, fragmenting and isolating populations, and inducing a species-area effect. It also might have delayed ecosystem recovery after the mass extinction.",0
"Purpose We propose a prescriptive framework to support environmentally conscious decision making in the design of goods and services. The framework bridges recent applications of input-output analysis to conduct environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), with seminal work in production economics. In the latter, product design, production planning, and scheduling problems are frequently formulated as input-output models with substitution, and subsequently analyzed and solved as linear programs. The use of linear programming provides an appealing theory and computational framework to support decision making, as well as to conduct sensitivity analysis Methods In this paper, we explore the benefits of integrating LCA within a linear programming (LP) framework and present a case study where we consider a hypothetical advertiser located in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, who wishes to allocate a predetermined budget to place ads in either the print or online versions of a high-circulation, local newspaper. We formulate the problem of finding an advertising strategy that minimizes global warming potential (GWP), subject to demand and budget constraints. We then solve the problem and evaluate the optimal strategy in terms of discharges of component greenhouse gases, and in terms of requirements imposed on various energy sources. We also analyze the sensitivity of the optimal advertising strategy (and associated global warming potential) to perturbations in the model parameters and constraints. Results and discussion By embedding LCA within an LP formulation, we are able to examine the relationships between economic and environmental factors inherent within decisions to use specific products or services. Specifically, the advertiser finds that each strategy contains tradeoffs among and between environmental and monetary costs. A disaggregate comparison of greenhouse gas release and energy consumption among strategies highlights the variation between these factors and the potential dangers of aggregation. Sensitivity analysis gives us marginal costs (per dollar and per person) of GWP in the optimal solution. These and other managerial insights presented highlight the complex tradeoffs necessary for environmentally conscious, sustainable decision making.",0
"During recent decades, many species have responded to global warming by poleward range expansions. We require a better mechanistic understanding of the nature and extent of such processes to assess how climate change might affect biodiversity. Wing-dimorphic bush-crickets are excellent objects to study dispersal and colonization processes at the range margin because the long-winged morphs (macropters) represent dispersal units of otherwise flightless species. Moreover, these insects produce noisy songs and can easily be mapped. The present study comprised a detailed investigation of the population dynamics and genetics at the edge of the range of Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeselii. We mapped the distribution of this insect in a previously unoccupied area of 185 km(2) and examined the genetic structure at the range margin using four polymorphic microsatellite loci. The results obtained demonstrate that the European heat wave in 2003 induced a strong immigration of macropters in the area stemming from multiple sources, whereas only few immigrants were recorded in the two subsequent years. Macropters were genotyped in a distance of up to 19.1 km from their origin, considerably exceeding the known dispersal distances for this species. Moreover, the data show that strong local founder effects are equalized on a large scale by the high number of immigrants from multiple sources. The present study demonstrates that macropters are of high significance for the range expansion of wing-dimorphic insects because a single-year climatic anomaly can induce strong dispersal processes.

" Most predictions of species distribution and abundance changes in response to global warming relate the individual requirements of a single isolated species to climate variables through some form of climate mapping. This method fails to account for the effects of species dispersal and species interactions, both of which may strongly affect distribution and abundance. 2. We therefore examined the effects of dispersal and species interactions on the distribution and abundance of three Drosophila species in a laboratory system that mimicked a latitudinal dine of 15 degrees C. We then investigated how species distribution and abundance in this system responded to simulated global warming. 3. Dispersal allowed populations to persist at non-optimum temperatures, overriding physiologically imposed range limits. 4. Temperature determined the outcome of competition. In pairwise interactions, Drosophila subobscura eliminated D. melanogaster or D, simulans at low temperatures but was itself eliminated at high temperatures. 5. Competitive interactions changed abundance and range sizes thus shifting the position of species optima. These changes depended on both the number and the identity of the competing species. 6. Enemy-victim interactions altered range and abundance. Adding the parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi affected the host assemblage directly at high temperatures where the parasitoid was present, and indirectly (mediated by dispersal) at low temperatures where it was scarce or absent. Host species coexisted for longer at low temperatures in dines when parasitoids were present than when they were absent. 7. Simulated global warming produced complex, counter-intuitive effects on distribution and abundance, including the reversal of species' relative abundance at some temperatures. 8. Because dispersal and species interactions strongly influenced both range and abundance (sometimes in unexpected ways) current species distributions are no guide to what they might be under global climate change. Furthermore, since both these factors are missing from climate envelope models of range and abundance change, their predictions are, at best, incomplete.",0
"We compared winter diets of Western Arctic Herd Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) from 1995/1996 and 2005 using microhistological fecal analysis on samples collected at paired permanent vegetation transects. Changes in the diets of Caribou followed the same trends as vegetative changes documented in long-term studies in northwestern Alaska. Lichens were significantly less prevalent oil the landscape and in the winter diets of Caribou between 1995/1996 and 2005, while graminoids (grasses and sedges) were significantly more prevalent, Dramatic changes are forecasted for Arctic ecosystems under global warming scenarios which may continue the trend of declining lichens in northwestern Alaska and-in-the diet of Western Arctic Herd Caribou. The question of whether or not the altered diet will affect the population dynamics of this herd remains unresolved.",0
" Predicting riverine discharge to the Arctic Ocean has become increasingly important because of the dominant role that river runoff plays in the freshwater balance of the Arctic Ocean, and the predicted high sensitivity of the region to global warming. The ability of land surface models to represent runoff and streamflow from northern river basins is critical to an understanding of the Arctic hydrologic cycle. A set of simulations with the land surface scheme VIC ( Variable Infiltration Capacity) implemented at 100 km EASE-Grid across the pan-Arctic domain was conducted to evaluate the model's representation of various hydrologic processes in the Arctic land region, and to provide a consistent baseline hydroclimatology for the region. The pan-Arctic drainage basin system was partitioned into 12 regions for purposes of model implementation and testing. Streamflow observations at various basin outlets, satellite-based snow cover extent, observed dates of lake freeze-up and break-up, and sited monitored summer permafrost maximum active layer thickness were used to evaluate various simulated hydrologic variables. The results indicate that the VIC model was able to reproduce these hydrologic processes in the Arctic region. A 21-year average river inflow ( 1979 - 1999) to the Arctic Ocean from the AORB ( Arctic Ocean River Basin) illustrated in Prowse and Flegg ( 2000), was estimated with the simulated streamflow as 3354 km(3)/yr, and 3596 km(3)/yr with the inclusion of the Arctic Archepelago, which are comparable to the previous estimates derived from the observed data.",0
"Awareness of global warming has stimulated research on environmental controls of soil methane (CH4) consumption and the effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on the terrestrial CH4 sink. In this study, factors impacting soil CH4 consumption were investigated using laboratory incubations of soils collected at the Free Air Carbon Transfer and Storage I site in the Duke Forest, NC, where plots have been exposed to ambient (370 mu L L-1) or elevated (ambient+200 mu L L-1) CO2 since August 1996. Over 1 year, nearly 90% of the 360 incubations showed net CH4 consumption, confirming that CH4-oxidizing (methanotrophic) bacteria were active. Soil moisture was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the 25-30 cm layer of elevated CO2 soils over the length of the study, but soil moisture was equal between CO2 treatments in shallower soils. The increased soil moisture corresponded to decreased net CH4 oxidation, as elevated CO2 soils also oxidized 70% less CH4 at the 25-30 cm depth compared to ambient CO2 soils, while CH4 consumption was equal between treatments in shallower soils. Soil moisture content predicted (p < 0.05) CH4 consumption in upper layers of ambient CO2 soils, but this relationship was not significant in elevated CO2 soils at any depth, suggesting that environmental factors in addition to moisture were influencing net CH4 oxidation under elevated CO2. More than 6% of the activity assays showed net CH4 production, and of these, 80% contained soils from elevated CO2 plots. In addition, more than 50% of the CH4-producing flasks from elevated CO2 sites contained deeper (25-30 cm) soils. These results indicate that subsurface (25 cm+) CH4 production contributes to decreased net CH4 consumption under elevated CO2 in otherwise aerobic soils.",0
"Background Existing theoretical models of the potential effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases do not account for social factors such as population increase, or interactions between climate variables. Our aim was to investigate the potential effects of global climate change on human health, and in particular, on the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Methods We modelled the reported global distribution of dengue fever on the basis of vapour pressure, which is a measure of humidity. We assessed changes in the geographical limits of dengue fever transmission, and in the number of people at risk of dengue by incorporating future climate change and human population projections into our model. Findings We showed that the current geographical limits of dengue fever transmission can be modelled with 89% accuracy on the basis of long-term average vapour pressure. In 1990, almost 30% of the world population, 5 billion people, lived in regions where the estimated risk of dengue transmission was greater than 50%. With population and climate change projections for 2085, we estimate that about 5-6 billion people (50-60% of the projected global population) would be at risk of dengue transmission, compared with 3.5 billion people, or 35% of the population, if climate change did not happen. Interpretation We conclude that climate change is likely to increase the area of land with a climate suitable for dengue fever transmission, and that if no other contributing factors were to change, a large proportion of the human population would then be put at risk.",0
"Several severe drought events have been reported in southern Europe during recent decades. Drought has been found to increase the mortality of the southernmost populations of Scots pine forests in Mediterranean countries and in dry inner-alpine valleys. Therefore the ongoing global climate change is likely to endanger Scots pine in future decades. Carbon starvation might be the main cause of the increasing mortality rate due to less carbon uptake and consequently to high susceptibility to biotic attacks. Forest management, in particular, thinning and shrub removal could decrease the intensity of drought stress by decreasing competition for water resources and thus increasing carbon uptake. The ongoing climate change and adaptive forest management will both play an important role for the sustainability of this specie across southern regions of Europe.",0
"Mountain ecosystems will likely be affected by global warming during the 21st century, with substantial biodiversity loss predicted by species distribution models (SDMs). Depending on the geographic extent, elevation range, and spatial resolution of data used in making these models, different rates of habitat loss have been predicted, with associated risk of species extinction. Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 x 10' grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25 m x 25 m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100% of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We find good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the fine-grain elevation range within 10 x 10' cells. The greatest prediction discrepancy for alpine species occurs in the area with the largest nival zone. Our results suggest elevation range as the main driver for the observed prediction discrepancies. Local-scale projections may better reflect the possibility for species to track their climatic requirement toward higher elevations.",0
"Aim High-latitude regions host many fewer non-native species than temperate ones. The low invasion loads of these colder regions may change with increases in human-mediated propagule supply. We test the hypothesis that colonization by non-native species that have already invaded temperate shorelines would be precluded by environmental conditions if they were introduced to Alaska and other high-latitude regions by shipping or other vectors. Location Pacific coast of North America as well as coastal oceans world-wide. Methods Using 16 habitat descriptors in ecological niche models, we characterized the conditions throughout the native and introduced distributions of four marine species (Amphibalanus improvisus, Carcinus maenas, Littorina saxatilis and Styela clava) that have invaded multiple global regions to test the extent to which suitable conditions for these species exist in Alaska and other high-latitude regions under current and predicted future climate scenarios. Results Models projected environmental match for all four species in many areas beyond their present range limits, suggesting that Alaska and other high-latitude shorelines are currently vulnerable to invasion by non-native species that occur in lower latitudes. Main conclusions Given current and possibly increasing human-mediated species transfers and suitable environmental conditions that exist now and with projected warming, policy and management efforts are urgently needed to minimize invasion opportunities at high latitudes.",0
"Remote sensing of global aerosols has constituted a great scientific interest in a variety of applications related to global warming and climate change. The present study uses Level 2 (10 x 10 km) and Level 3 (1 degrees x 1 degrees) Terra/Aqua MODIS (C005) derived aerosol optical depths at 550 nm (AOD(550)) and compares them with ground-based (MICROTOPS-II, MT) sun photometer measured AOD(550) in the period 2002-2008 over Hyderabad, India. The correlation coefficient (R-2) between Level 3 Terra/Aqua MODIS and MT AOD(550) in all seasons ranges from 0.30 to 0.46. Even lower correlations revealed when the Level 2 MODIS data are used (R-2 = 0.16-0.30). The Level 3 MODIS AOD(550) underestimates significantly the MT AOD(550), while the Level 2 AOD(550) values are much larger than those of Level 3. The comparison of the Terra/Aqua MODIS AOD(550) at regional scale, and especially over urban/industrial areas with significant aerosol diurnal variation, constitutes a real challenge and may reveal the ability of the two sensors to capture the temporal variation of the aerosol loading within a time interval of 3 h. The results show relatively good correlation (R-2 similar to 0.6-0.7) regarding the Level 3 dataset; however, the Level 2 data showed large scatter and very poor correlations. On the other hand, the mean seasonal AOD(550) values are similar, while Terra AOD(550) is higher than that obtained from Aqua. Both satellite and ground-based measurements show remarkable increasing trends in AOD over Hyderabad, which are attributed to the extension of the urbanized area, the growing of population, motor vehicles and local emissions.

"It has been suggested that global warming may alter the frequency and transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases. To test this claim for schistosomiasis, we conducted a time-series analysis from 1972-2002 for 39 of the 70 counties of Jiangsu province, eastern China, where Schistosoma japonicum is partially endemic. We used a modeling approach to estimate the annual growing degree-days (AGDD), employing a lower temperature threshold of 15.3 degrees C. Our final model included both temporal and spatial components, the former consisting of second order polynomials in time plus a seasonality component, whereas the spatial trend was formed by second order polynomials of the coordinates plus the thin-plate smoothing splines. We found that temperature increased over the past 30 years in all observing stations. There were distinct temporal trends with seasonality and periodicities of 12, 6, and 3 months, whereas only marginal spatial variation was observed. The predicted AGDDs for 2006 and 2003 showed increases for the entire Jiangsu province, with the AGDDs difference between these two time points exhibiting an increase from north to South. Our data suggest that changes in temperature will alter the extent and level of schistosomiasis transmission, which is relevant for the control of S. japonicum in a future warmer China.",0
"Current concerns for the future of reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in the far north under conditions of global warming focus on the increased energetic and predation costs associated with warmer winters and on vegetation change and increased insect harassment caused by warmer summers. At the Grotte XVI archaeological site (Dordogne, southwestern France), episodes of summer warming between about 36,000 and 12,000 radiocarbon years ago appear to be associated with lowered relative abundances of reindeer. As the Pleistocene ended and summer temperatures climbed higher, reindeer were extirpated from southern France. A similar phenomenon appears to have occurred here during the prior Eemian interglacial. These records suggest that increased summer temperatures under conditions of global warming may have a direct negative effect on reindeer and caribou populations, including a northward displacement of their southern distributional boundary.",0
"Among the biosphere-atmosphere interactions that influence climate, the emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from the ocean plays a prominent role for its high potential in cloud albedo regulation. In order to advance in our understanding and quantification of this coupled ocean-atmosphere system, both synoptic and predictive capabilities must be largely improved. Hitherto, large-scale oceanic DMS has eluded being captured from remote sensing, correlated with synoptic variables, or simulated by mechanistic modeling. We have found a simple empirical relationship that permits global-ocean monthly distributions of DMS concentration to be computed from a combination of remotely sensed biospheric data (chlorophyll a) and climatological geophysical data (mixed layer depth). This relationship allows for the desired synopticity and predictability in the ocean-to-atmosphere sulfur flux, which we have globally quantified as 23-35 Tg S yr(-1). Also, our algorithm stands in support of a biogenic-DMS/solar-radiation negative feedback and opens the door toward quantifying its strength and its response to global warming.",0
"Climate change will likely exacerbate already existing urban social inequities and health risks, thereby exacerbating existing urban health inequities. Cities in low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Urbanization is both a cause of and potential solution to global climate change. Most population growth in the foreseeable future will occur in urban areas primarily in developing countries. How this growth is managed has enormous implications for climate change given the increasing concentration and magnitude of economic production in urban localities, as well as the higher consumption practices of urbanites, especially the middle classes, compared to rural populations. There is still much to learn about the extent to which climate change affects urban health equity and what can be done effectively in different socio-political and socio-economic contexts to improve the health of urban dwelling humans and the environment. But it is clear that equity-oriented climate change adaptation means attention to the social conditions in which urban populations live-this is not just a climate change policy issue, it requires inter-sectoral action. Policies and programs in urban planning and design, workplace health and safety, and urban agriculture can help mitigate further climate change and adapt to existing climate change. If done well, these will also be good for urban health equity.",0
"At the last glacial maximum, vast ice sheets covered many continental areas. The beds of some shallow seas were exposed thereby connecting previously separated landmasses. Although some areas were ice-free and supported a flora and fauna, mean annual temperatures were 10-13degreesC colder than during the Holocene. Within a few millennia of the glacial maximum, deglaciation started, characterized by a series of climatic fluctuations between about 18 000 and 11 400 years ago. Following the general thermal maximum in the Holocene, there has been a modest overall cooling trend, superimposed upon which have been a series of millennial and centennial fluctuations in climate such as the ""Little Ice Age spanning approximately the late 13th to early 19th centuries. Throughout the climatic fluctuations of the last 150 000 years, Arctic ecosystems and biota have been close to their minimum extent within the most recent 10 000 years. They suffered loss of diversity as a result of extinctions during the most recent large-magnitude rapid global warming at the end of the last glacial stage. Consequently, Arctic ecosystems and biota such as large vertebrates are already under pressure and are particularly vulnerable to current and projected future global warming. Evidence from the past indicates that the treeline will very as it probably advance, perhaps rapidly, into tundra areas, a it did during the early Holocene, reducing the extent of tundra and increasing the risk of species extinction. Species will very probably extend their ranges northwards, displacing Arctic species as in the past. However, unlike the early Holocene, when lower relative sea level allowed a belt of tundra to persist around at least some parts of the Arctic basin when treelines advanced to the present coast, sea level is very likely to rise in future, further restricting the area of tundra and other treeless Arctic ecosystems. The negative response of current Arctic ecosystems to global climatic conditions that are apparently without precedent during the Pleistocene is likely to be considerable, particularly as their exposure to co-occurring environmental changes (such as enhanced levels of UV-B, deposition of nitrogen compounds from the atmosphere, heavy metal and acidic pollution, radioactive contamination, increased habitat fragmentation) is also without precedent.",0
"A model describing macroalgal early life stages and adult dynamics was used to quantify the effects of non-adult forms on the productivity of adult macroalgae in a eutrophic estuary. Predictions indicate that during years with mild winters and low rainfall, spring blooms will occur at the expense of the growth and reproduction of overwintering adults and without the contribution of the spore bank. In these circumstances, there is a positive correlation between the intensity of the blooms and the biomass of overwintering adults until a maximum threshold value. On the contrary, in years with high rainfall and low or inexistent biomass of overwintering adults, the onset of adult's growth depends on the biomass of viable dormant spores, the growing season occurs later and adult productivity is very limited. Long-term predictions for climate change scenarios suggest that, in general, global warming will have adverse affects on Ulva intestinalis productivity, with the adults being more affected than the early life stages.

"Documenting successional dynamics of coral communities following large-scale bleaching events is necessary to predict coral population responses to global climate change. In 1998, high sea surface temperatures and low cloud cover in the western Pacific Ocean caused high coral mortality on the outer exposed reefs of Palau (Micronesia), while coral mortality in sheltered bays was low. Recovery was examined from 2001 to 2005 at 13 sites stratified by habitat (outer reefs, patch reefs and bays) and depth (3 and 10 m). Two hypotheses were tested: (1) rates of change of coral cover vary in accordance with habitat, and (2) recovery rates depend on recruitment. Coral cover increased most in the sheltered bays, despite a low recruitment rate, suggesting that recovery in bays was primarily a consequence of remnant regrowth. Recruitment densities were consistently high on the wave-exposed reefs, particularly the western slopes, where recovery was attributed to both recruitment and regrowth of remnants. Recovery was initially more rapid at 10 m than 3 m on outer reefs, but in 2004, recovery rates were similar at both depths. Rapid recovery was possible because Palau's coral reefs were buffered by remnant survival and recruitment from the less impacted habitats.",0
"Forensic entomology establishes the postmortem interval (PMI) by studying cadaveric fauna. The PMI today is still largely based on tables of insect succession on human cadavers compiled in the late 19th- or mid-20th centuries. In the last few years, however, the gradual warming of the climate has been changing faunal communities by favouring the presence of thermophilous species. To demonstrate how globalisation and climate change are overcoming geographic barriers, we present some cases of southern and allochthonous species found in north-east Italy during our entomo-forensic investigations.

"Eddy covariance measurements of methane flux were carried out in an arctic tundra landscape in the central Lena River Delta at 72 degrees N. The measurements covered the seasonal course of mid-summer to early winter in 2003 and early spring to mid-summer in 2004, including the periods of spring thaw and autumnal freeze back. The study site is characterized by very cold and deep permafrost and a continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of -14.7 degrees C. The surface is characterized by wet polygonal tundra, with a micro-relief consisting of raised moderately dry sites, depressed wet sites, polygonal ponds, and lakes. We found relatively low fluxes of typically 30 mg CH(4) m(-2) day(-1) during mid-summer and identified soil temperature and near-surface atmospheric turbulence as the factors controlling methane emission. The influence of atmospheric turbulence was attributed to the high coverage of open water surfaces in the tundra. The soil thaw depth and water table position were found to have no clear effect on methane fluxes. The excess emission during spring thaw was estimated to be about 3% of the total flux measured during June-October. Winter emissions were modeled based on the functional relationships found in the measured data. The annual methane emission was estimated to be 3.15 g m(-2). This is low compared with values reported for similar ecosystems. Reason for this were thought to be the very low permafrost temperature in the study region, the sandy soil texture and low bio-availability of nutrients in the soils, and the high surface coverage of moist to dry micro-sites. The methane emission accounted for about 14% of the annual ecosystem carbon balance. Considering the global warming potential of methane, the methane emission turned the tundra into an effective greenhouse gas source.",0
"The majority of studies on environmental change focus on the response of single species and neglect fundamental biotic interactions, such as mutualism, competition, predation, and parasitism, which complicate patterns of species persistence. Under global warming, disruption of community interactions can arise when species differ in their sensitivity to rising temperature, leading to mismatched phenologies and/or dispersal patterns. To study species persistence under global climate change, it is critical to consider the ecology and evolution of multispecies interactions; however, the sheer number of potential interactions makes a full study of all interactions unfeasible. One mechanistic approach to solving the problem of complicated community context to global change is to (i) define strategy groups of species based on life-history traits, trophic position, or location in the ecosystem, (ii) identify species involved in key interactions within these groups, and (iii) determine from the interactions of these key species which traits to study in order to understand the response to global warming. We review the importance of multispecies interactions looking at two trait categories: thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and associated life-history traits and dispersal traits of species. A survey of published literature shows pronounced and consistent differences among trophic groups in thermal sensitivity of life-history traits and in dispersal distances. Our approach increases the feasibility of unraveling such a large and diverse set of community interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of community responses to global warming.",0
"In keeping with the global efforts on inventorisation of methane emission, municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are recognised as one of the major sources of anthropogenic emissions generated from human activities. In India, most of the solid wastes are disposed of by landfilling in low-lying areas located in and around the urban centres resulting in generation of large quantities of biogas containing a sizeable proportion of methane. After a critical review of literature on the methodology for estimation of methane emissions, the default methodology has been used in estimation following the IPCC guidelines 1996. However, as the default methodology assumes that all potential methane is emitted in the year of waste deposition, a triangular model for biogas from landfill has been proposed and the results are compared. The methodology proposed for methane emissions from landfills based on a triangular model is more realistic and can very well be used in estimation on global basis. Methane emissions from MSW landfills for the year AD 1980-1999 have been estimated which could be used in computing national inventories of methane emission. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Measurements of solar irradiance have revealed variations at all the sampled time scales (ranging from minutes to the length of the solar cycle). One important task of models is to identify the causes of the observed (total and spectral) irradiance variations. Another major aim is to reconstruct irradiance over time scales longer than sampled by direct measurements in order to consider if and to what extent solar irradiance variations may be responsible for global climate change. Here, we describe recent efforts to model solar irradiance over the current and the previous two solar cycles. These irradiance models are remarkably successful in reproducing the observed total and spectral irradiance, although further improvements are still possible. (c) 2005 COSPAR.

"Global climate change models indicate that storm magnitudes will increase in many areas throughout southwest North America, which could result in up to a 25% increase in seasonal precipitation in the Big Bend region of the Chihuahuan Desert over the next 50 years. Seasonal precipitation is a key limiting factor regulating primary productivity, soil microbial activity, and ecosystem dynamics in arid and semiarid regions. As decomposers, soil microbial communities mediate critical ecosystem processes that ultimately affect the success of all trophic levels, and the activity of these microbial communities is primarily regulated by moisture availability. This research is focused on elucidating soil microbial responses to seasonal and yearly changes in soil moisture, temperature, and selected soil nutrient and edaphic properties in a Sotol Grassland in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend National Park. Soil samples were collected over a 3-year period in March and September (2004-2006) at 0-15 cm soil depth from 12 3 x 3 m community plots. Bacterial and fungal carbon usage (quantified using Biolog 96-well micro-plates) was related to soil moisture patterns (ranging between 3.0 and 14%). In addition to soil moisture, the seasonal and yearly variability of soil bacterial activity was most closely associated with levels of soil organic matter, extractable NH(4)-N, and soil pH. Variability in fungal activity was related to soil temperatures ranging between 13 and 26 degrees C. These findings indicate that changes in soil moisture, coupled with soil temperatures and resource availability, drive the functioning of soil-microbial dynamics in these desert grasslands. Temporal patterns in microbial activity may reflect the differences in the ability of bacteria and fungi to respond to seasonal patterns of moisture and temperature. Bacteria were more able to respond to moisture pulses regardless of temperature, while fungi only responded to moisture pulses during cooler seasons with the exception of substantial increased magnitudes in precipitation occurring during warmer months. Changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation will alter the proportional contribution of bacteria and fungi to decomposition and nitrogen mineralization in this desert grassland.",0
"An analysis tool was developed to simulate primary productivity and crop yields for both present and possible future climate conditions. Southern Africa was delineated into 712 relatively homogeneous climate zones, each with specific climate, soil and vegetation response information. The primary productivity and crop yield models were linked with the climate zones via a cell-based agrohydrological model, with the final output coordinated using a Geographic information System. The results of this preliminary study show a large dependence of production and crop yield on the intra-seasonal and inter-annual variation of rainfall. The most important conclusion from the study is the readiness of the developed tool and associated infrastructure for future analysis into social, technological and political responses to food security in southern Africa.",0
"Peatland soils represent globally significant stores of carbon, and understanding carbon cycling pathways in these ecosystems has important implications for global climate change. We measured aceticlastic and autotrophic methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, denitrification, and iron reduction in a bog, an intermediate fen, and a rich fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for one growing season. In 3-d anaerobic incubations of slurried peat, denitrification and iron reduction were minor components of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Experiments using (14)C-labeled methanogenic substrates showed that methanogenesis in these peatlands was primarily through the aceticlastic pathway, except early in the growing season in more ombrotrophic peatlands, where the autotrophic pathway was dominant or codominant. Overall, methane production was responsible for 3-70% of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Sulfate reduction accounted for 0-26% of anaerobic carbon mineralization, suggesting a rapid turnover of a very small sulfate pool. A large percentage of anaerobic carbon mineralization (from 29% to 85%) was unexplained by any measured process, which could have resulted from fermentation or possibly from the use of organic molecules (e.g., humic acids) as alternative electron acceptors.",0
"Global climate change may impact wildlife populations by affecting local weather patterns, which, in turn, can impact a variety of ecological processes. However, it is not clear that local variations in ecological processes can be explained by large-scale patterns of climate. The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) is a large-scale climate phenomenon that has been shown to influence the population dynamics of some animals. Although effects of the NAO on vertebrate population dynamics have been studied, it remains uncertain whether it broadly predicts the impact of weather on species. We examined the ability of local weather data and the NAO to explain the annual variation in population. dynamics of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA. We performed canonical correlation analysis on the demographic subspace of ptarmigan and local-climate subspace defined by the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) using data from 1975 to 1999. We found that two subspaces were significantly correlated on the first canonical variable. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the first EOF values of the demographic and local-climate subspaces was significant. The population density and the first EOF of local-climate subspace influenced the ptarmigan population with 1-year lags in the Gompertz model. However, the NAO index was neither related to the first two EOF of local-climate subspace nor to the first EOF of the demographic subspace of ptarmigan. Moreover, the NAO index was not a significant term in the Gompertz model for the ptarmigan population. Therefore, local climate had stronger signature on the demography of ptarmigan than did a large-scale index, i.e., the NAO index. We conclude that local responses of wildlife populations to changing climate may not be adequately explained by models that project large-scale climatic patterns.",0
"This paper presents an updated overview integrating both previous and newly published data on the most important floras found associated with Early Permian coal seams in the Parana Basin, Brazil. These floras occur within the Rio Bonito Formation and correspond to the Gondwana ""Glossopteris Flora."" For this review, five floras are selected, in ascending stratigraphic order: the ""Sao Joao do Triunfo,"" ""Figueira."" ""Quiteria,"" ""Morro do Papaleo"" and ""Irapua Bed"" floras. They are the best-known floras of the basin in terms of taxonomic composition, paleoecology and environments of deposition. An early-mid Sakmarian to earliest Artinskian age is indicated for the Rio Bonito Formation based on absolute radiometric and relative biostratigraphic ages. Integration of available information about the selected floras allows evaluation of taphonomic and paleoecological factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the Early Permian floral record in the Parana Basin. The variation observed in both the taxonomic composition of individual floras and in the frequency of occurrence of different plant groups is due to the broad range of environmental/edaphic conditions that prevailed in the many different depositional settings represented in the Rio Bonito Formation. A more precise age determination obtained for the plant-bearing deposits permits the establishment of a more confident correlation between the Early Permian floral succession in the Parana Basin and other Early Permian floral successions in other basins. The Sakmarian global warming favored the appearance of pecopterid and sphenopterid ferns amongst the spore-producing plants, and the glossopterids amongst the pollen-producing plants.

"Although the impact of warming on winter limitation of aphid populations is reasonably well understood, the impacts of hot summers and heat wave events are less clear. In this study, we address this question through a detailed analysis of the thermal ecology of three closely related aphid species: Myzus persicae, a widespread, polyphagous temperate zone pest, Myzus polaris, an arctic aphid potentially threatened by climate warming, and, Myzus ornatus, a glasshouse pest that may benefit from warming. The upper lethal limits (ULT(50)) and heat coma temperatures of the aphid species reared at both 15 and 20 degrees C did not differ significantly, suggesting that heat coma is a reliable indicator of fatal heat stress. Heat coma and CT(max) were also measured after aphids were reared at 10 and 25 degrees C for one and three generations. The extent of the acclimation response was not influenced by the number of generations. Acclimation increased CT(max) with rearing temperature for all species. The acclimation temperature also influenced heat coma; this relationship was linear for M. ornatus and M. polaris but non-linear for M. persicae (increased tolerance at 10 and 25 degrees C). Bacteria known generically as secondary symbionts can promote thermal tolerance of aphids, but they were not detected in the aphids studied here. Assays of optimum development temperature were also performed for each species. All data indicate that M. persicae has the greatest tolerance of high temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Climate warming in northeastern Siberia may induce thaw-mobilization of the organic carbon (OC) now held in permafrost. This study investigated the composition of terrestrial OC exported to Arctic coastal waters to both obtain a natural integration of terrestrial permafrost OC release and to further understand the fate of released carbon in the extensive Siberian Shelf Seas. Application of a variety of elemental, molecular and isotopic (delta C-13 and Delta C-14) analyses of both surface water suspended particulate matter and underlying surface sediments along a 500 km transect from Kolyma River mouth to the mid-shelf of the East Siberian Sea yielded information on the sources, degradation status and transport processes of thaw-mobilized soil OC. A three end-member dual-carbon-isotopic mixing model was applied to deduce the relative contributions from riverine, coastal erosion and marine sources. The mixing model was solved numerically using Monte Carlo simulations to obtain a fair representation of the uncertainties of both end-member composition and the end results. Riverine OC contributions to sediment OC decrease with increasing distance offshore (35 +/- 15 to 13 +/- 9%), whereas coastal erosion OC exhibits a constantly high contribution (51 +/- 11 to 60 +/- 12%) and marine OC increases offshore (9 +/- 7 to 36 +/- 10%). We attribute the remarkably strong imprint of OC from coastal erosion, extending up to similar to 500 km from the coast, to efficient offshoreward transport in these shallow waters presumably through both the benthic boundary layer and ice-rafting. There are also indications of simultaneous selective preservation of erosion OC compared to riverine OC. Molecular degradation proxies and radiocarbon contents indicated a degraded but young (Delta C-14 ca. -60% or ca. 500 C-14 years) terrestrial OC pool in surface water particulate matter, underlain by a less degraded but old (Delta C-14 ca. -500% or ca. 5500 C-14 years) terrestrial OC pool in bottom sediments. We suggest that the terrestrial OC fraction in surface water particulate matter is mainly derived from surface soil and recent vegetation fluvially released as buoyant organic-rich aggregates (e. g., humics), which are subjected to extensive processing during coastal transport. In contrast, terrestrial OC in the underlying sediments is postulated to originate predominantly from erosion of mineral-rich Pleistocene coasts (i.e., yedoma) and inland mineral soils. Sorptive association of this organic matter with mineral particles protects the OC from remineralization and also promotes rapid settling (ballasting) of the OC. Our findings corroborate recent studies by indicating that different Arctic surface soil OC pools exhibit distinguishing susceptibilities to degradation in coastal waters. Consequently, the general postulation of a positive feedback to global warming from degradation of permafrost carbon may be both attenuated (by reburial of one portion) and geographically displaced (degradation of released terrestrial permafrost OC far out over the Arctic shelf seas).",0
"Soil is one of the most important natural subsystems of the Earth's landscapes, which is exceptionally vital for a human being as the main source of food resources. In order to take care of the future one of the most relevant problems of the mankind is to preserve soils of the Earth, their fertility and normal state under conditions of the increasing technogenic effect and degradation of natural landscapes. As the global warming has already started, its after-effects, which will be in-vertable faced by the Lithuanian agriculture, must be overcome as an additional negative factor. The paper aims at revealing the dependence of the total carbon on pH. It also focuses on the impact of climate change on the total carbon and soil degradation.",0
"In this paper, precipitation concentrations across the Pearl River basin and the associated spatial patterns are analyzed based on daily precipitation data of 42 rain gauging stations during the period 1960-2005. Regions characterized by the different changing properties of precipitation concentration index (CI) are identified. The southwest and northeast parts of the Pearl River basin are characterized by lower and decreasing precipitation CI; the northwest and south parts of the study river basin show higher and increasing precipitation CI. Higher but decreasing precipitations CI are found in the West and East River basin. Comparison of precipitation CI trends before and after 1990 shows that most parts of the Pearl River basin are characterized by increasing precipitation CI after 1990. Decreasing precipitation CI after 1990 (compared to precipitation CI changes before 1990) is observed only in a few stations located in the lower Gui River and the lower Yu River. Significant increasing precipitation CI after 1990 is detected in the West River, lower North River and upper Beipan River. These changes of precipitation CI in the Pearl River basin are likely to be associated with the consequences of the well-evidenced global warming. These findings can contribute to basin-scale water resource management and conservation of ecological environment in the Pearl River basin.",0
"Global climate change is expected to affect future rainfall patterns. These changes should be taken into account when assessing future flooding risks. This study presents a method for quantifying the increase in flood risk caused by global climate change for use in urban flood risk management. Flood risk in this context is defined as the product of flood damage potential and the probability of its occurrence. The study uses a geographic information system-based flood damage prediction model to calculate the flood damage caused by design storms with different return periods. Estimation of the monetary damages these storms produce and their return periods are precursors to flood risk calculations. The design storms are developed from modified intensity-duration-frequency relationships generated by simulations of global climate change scenarios (e.g. CGCM2A2). The risk assessment method is applied to the Kanda River basin in Tokyo, Japan. The assessment provides insights not only into the flood risk cost increase due to global warming, and the impact that increase may have on flood control infrastructure planning.",0
"Central to the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) third assessment report, released in Shanghai in January 2001, was the statement: ""There is now new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."" This represents a significant strengthening of the analogous statement issued by the IPCC in 1996: ""The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate"" In this article the scientific evidence leading up to these IPCC statements is reviewed. A historical perspective of the Earths climate over the last 400,000 years is presented, as is the science of global warming over the last 200 years. The range of projections of climate change over the next century is also summarized giving particular emphasis to projections concerning Canada. The issue of uncertainty in climate change projections is tackled and the public confusion arising from the media portrayal of the science and its entry into the political arena discussed. Finally, The Kyoto Protocol and how it fits within the framework of necessary actions required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is reviewed.",0
"The assimilation of carbon by plant communities (gross primary production [GPP]) is a central concern in plant ecology as well as for our understanding of global climate change. As an alternative to traditional methods involving destructive harvests or time-consuming measurements, we present a simple, general model for GPP as the product of the lifetime carbon gain by a single leaf, the daily leaf production rate, and the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis. To test the model, we estimated leaf lifetime carbon gain for 26 species using the concept of mean labor time for leaves (the part of each day the leaf functions to full capacity), average potential photosynthetic capacity over the leaf lifetime, and functional leaf longevity (leaf longevity discounted for periods within a year wholly unfavorable for photosynthesis). We found that the lifetime carbon gain of leaves was rather constant across species. Moreover, when foliar biomass was regressed against functional leaf longevity, aseasonal and seasonal forests fell on a single line, suggesting that the leaf production rate during favorable periods is not substantially different among forests in the world. The gross production of forest ecosystems then can be predicted to a first approximation simply by the annual duration of the period favorable for photosynthetic activity in any given region.",0
"Global warming may change the thermocline water pathways and transports from the subtropics to the tropics in the Pacific Ocean, which are known to have profound implications for the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and thereby global climate. This study investigates the changes by comparing solutions between a present-day climate and a future, warmer climate from a set of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) models. As the climate warms, although the total transport from the subtropics to the tropics exhibits no significant change, transport via western boundary pathways increases and via interior pathways decreases. This shift is due to high potential vorticity (PV) zones that extend further westward, thus dynamically guiding thermocline water away from interior pathways to prefer western boundary pathways from the subtropics to the tropics. Additionally, a warmer climate induces a large temperature increase near the sea surface in the eastern tropics and a significantly enhanced Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) in the western and central Pacific; the former is related to the decreased transport through interior pathways and the latter is linked to the increased transport through western boundary pathways. Implications of the results of this study are also discussed. Citation: Luo, Y., L. M. Rothstein, and R.-H.

"Climate is one of the determinants driving ecosystems on both local and global scales. During the last two decades, there has occurred a dramatic temperature increase in the northern midlatitudes to high latitudes. The rapid warming has resulted in the promotion of bioactivity and an early growing season. However, the temperature and vegetation changes are not uniform in geographical distribution. In the present study, we analyze the spatial features in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-temperature relationship over Eurasia and North America in spring for the period 1982-2000. The NDVI data are derived from the Earth Observing System Pathfinder advanced very high resolution radiometer data sets. A singular value decomposition analysis is applied to the covariance matrix of the NDVI and temperature. Most of the squared covariance, 96%, is captured by the first seven paired modes. The result clearly indicates that the temperature is a focal factor influencing vegetation activity. Furthermore, those seven paired modes show large-scale features and well-defined patterns. The atmospheric circulation systems, such as the Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation, Pacific/North American pattern, Eurasian pattern, western Pacific pattern, western Atlantic pattern, eastern Atlantic pattern, and North Pacific index, are found to be associated with that. The time coefficient corresponding to the first paired modes, centered on western Siberia, is correlated significantly with the Eurasian teleconnection pattern. Their correlation coefficients are 0.72 and 0.78 for vegetation and temperature, respectively, for the data period. Other modes are also correlated with one or more circulation indices. This implies that the large-scale circulation is essential for understanding the regional response of vegetation to global climate change. Taking all nine circulation indices and time lags into account, a large portion (71%) of the satellite-sensed variance in NDVI could be explained. The temperature-NDVI relationships did not change significantly when the NDVI was rescaled from 1 to 5 degrees, indicating that the singular value decomposition analysis is an appropriate technique for detecting the degree of coupling between vegetation and climate and that the vegetation-temperature relationship presented in this study is robust.",0
"Context. Total solar irradiance changes by about 0.1% between solar activity maximum and minimum. Accurate measurements of this quantity are only available since 1978 and do not provide information on longer-term secular trends. Aims. In order to reliably evaluate the Sun's role in recent global climate change, longer time series are, however, needed. They can only be assessed with the help of suitable models. Methods. The total solar irradiance is reconstructed from the end of the Maunder minimum to the present based on variations of the surface distribution of the solar magnetic field. The latter is calculated from the historical record of the sunspot number using a simple but consistent physical model. Results. Our model successfully reproduces three independent data sets: total solar irradiance measurements available since 1978, total photospheric magnetic flux since 1974 and the open magnetic flux since 1868 empirically reconstructed using the geomagnetic aa-index. The model predicts an increase in the solar total irradiance since the Maunder minimum of 3(-0.4)(+0.2) Wm(-2).",0
"Phenological records constructed from global mapping satellite platforms (e.g. AVHRR and MODIS) hold the potential to be valuable tools for monitoring vegetation response to global climate change. However, most satellite phenology products are not validated, and field checking coarse scale (>= 500 m) data with confidence is a difficult endeavor. In this research, we compare phenology from Landsat (field scale, 30 m) to MODIS (500 m), and compare datasets derived from each instrument. Landsat and MODIS yield similar estimates of the start of greenness (r(2) =0.60), although we find that a high degree of spatial phenological variability within coarser-scale MODIS pixels may be the cause of the remaining uncertainty. In addition, spatial variability is smoothed in MODIS, a potential source of error when comparing in situ or climate data to satellite phenology. We show that our method for deriving phenology from satellite data generates spatially coherent interannual phenology departures in MODIS data. We test these estimates from 2000 to 2005 against long-term records from Harvard Forest (Massachusetts) and Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire) Experimental Forests. MODIS successfully predicts 86% of the variance at Harvard forest and 70% of the variance at Hubbard Brook; the more extreme topography of the later is inferred to be a significant source of error. In both analyses, the satellite estimate is significantly dampened from the ground-based observations, suggesting systematic error (slopes of 0.56 and 0.63, respectively). The satellite data effectively estimates interannual phenology at two relatively simple deciduous forest sites and is internally consistent, even with changing spatial scale. We propose that continued analyses of interannual phenology will be an effective tool for monitoring native forest responses to global-scale climate variability. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

"We studied the effects of upwelling on nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in the pelagic and littoral zones of Lake Tanganyika near Kigoma, Tanzania. During the dry season of 2004, a rise in the thermocline and sudden drop in surface water temperatures indicated a substantial upwelling event. Increases in concentrations of nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus, and silica in the surface waters occurred simultaneously after the temperature drop. Within days, chlorophyll a concentrations increased and remained elevated, while inorganic nutrient concentrations returned to preupwelling levels and organic nutrient concentrations peaked. We observed parallel temporal patterns of water temperature, nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton chlorophyll in both the pelagic and the littoral zones, demonstrating that upwelling strongly affects the nearshore ecosystem as well as the pelagic zone. Concurrent records from 12 littoral sites indicated spatial variation in the timing, magnitude, and biological response to upwelling. There was no discernable latitudinal pattern in the timing of upwelling, suggesting that mixing did not result from a progressive wave. Our monitoring, as well as other multiyear studies, suggests that dry-season upwelling occurs during most years in northern Lake Tanganyika. The observed sensitivity of littoral nutrients and phytoplankton to upwelling suggests that reductions in upwelling due to global climate change could strongly affect the dynamics of the spectacular nearshore ecosystem of Lake Tanganyika, as has been proposed for the pelagic zone.",0
"Climate change, involving changes in mean climate and climatic variability, is expected to severely affect agriculture and there is a need to assess its impact in order to define the appropriate adaptation strategies to cope with. In this paper, we projected a scenario of European agriculture in a +2 degrees C (above pre-industrial levels) world in order to assess the potential effect of climatic change and variability and to test the effectiveness of different adaptation options. For this purpose, the outputs of HadCM3 General Circulation Model (GCM) were empirically downscaled for current climate (1975-2005) and a future period (2030-2060), to feed a process-based crop simulation model, in order to quantify the impact of a changing climate on agriculture emphasising the impact due to changes in the frequency of extreme events (heat waves and drought). The same climatic dataset was used to compare the effectiveness of different adaptations to a warmer climate strategies including advanced or delayed sowing time, shorter or longer cycle cultivar and irrigation. The results indicated that both changes in mean climate and climate variability affected crop growth resulting in different crop fitting capacity to cope with climate change. This capacity mainly depended on the crop type and the geographical area across Europe. A +2 degrees C scenario had a higher impact on crops cultivated over the Mediterranean basin than on those cultivated in central and northern Europe as a consequence of drier and hotter conditions. In contrast, crops cultivated in Northern Europe generally exhibited higher than current yields, as a consequence of wetter conditions, and temperatures closer to the optimum growing conditions. Simple, no-cost adaptation options such as advancement of sowing dates or the use of longer cycle varieties may be implemented to tackle the expected yield loss in southern Europe as well as to exploit possible advantages in northern regions.",0
"This paper is devoted to a brief critical review of major achievements and shortcomings in numerical modeling of climatic characteristics of the World Ocean. It is shown that the most interesting results are obtained due to the transition to high resolution (the horizontal grid spacing being no more than 1/18A degrees). The need to switch to higher resolution (about 0.01A degrees) is also obvious. The author deeply appreciates the study by Guo et al. [25] in which the role of JEBAR and other terms of the integral mass transport equation is assessed. High resolution, however, is not the only problem. A mathematical description of the physical processes of ice formation and melting and a four-dimensional analysis of the data remain a difficult problem. It is noted that in a number of studies extensive integration tends to filter out the results in a simulation of intense currents. This process of Sverdrupization of the integral mass transport is shown schematically in Fig. 2. An original scheme of the formation of the equatorial subsurface countercurrents is presented. The author suggests that neither modeling nor analyzing the resulting data show the presence of warming in the World Ocean; hence, there is no global warming in the atmosphere either.",0
"Reconstructed historical temperature and flood/drought variations based on historical records for the Yangtze Delta are analyzed with the help of power spectral and continuous wavelet analyses. Three distinct climate periods can be identified in the Yangtze Delta: Warm Medieval Period (AD 1000-1400), Little Ice Age (AD 1400-1920), and the ongoing well-established Global Warming Period (AD 1920-present). The variability of temperature is of great magnitude, and periods dominated by warm/cold temperature are usually interrupted by cold/warm periods. A comparison of flood/drought variations and temperature variations indicates that there are obviously no fixed modes of climate changes such as warm-wet, cold-wet, warm-dry or cold-dry. However, the results demonstrate that large-magnitude temperature variations usually lead to a higher frequency of flood/drought hazards in the Yangtze Delta. Furthermore, the frequency of flood/drought events usually increased in the transition periods from one climate state to another. The ongoing period of climate change is another transition from cold temperatures during the Little Ice Age to increasing temperatures and variability. This might increase the probability and reoccurrence of flood/drought events and other extreme climate events in the Yangtze Delta. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.",0
"Planned adaptation to climate change requires information about what is happening and why. While a long-term trend is for global warming, short-term periods of cooling can occur and have physical causes associated with natural variability. However, such natural variability means that energy is rearranged or changed within the climate system, and should be traceable. An assessment is given of our ability to track changes in reservoirs and flows of energy within the climate system. Arguments are given that developing the ability to do this is important, as it affects interpretations of global and especially regional climate change, and prospects for the future.",0
"Influences of sea surface temperature (SST) spatial patterns and cumulus parameterizations on tropical cyclone (TC) frequency, in the context of global warming impacts, are investigated using an atmospheric general circulation model at T106 horizontal resolution. Simulated TCs in this high-resolution model are categorized into tropical storms (TSs) and tropical depressions (TDs). Model TSs are defined as TCs with maximum surface wind speed more than, or equal to 16 m s(-1), for experiments with an Arakawa-Schubert cumulus parameterization. Another threshold of 14 m s(-1) is used for those with a Kuo cumulus parameterization. Model TDs are defined as weaker TCs. Although the maximum wind speed, and the minimum central pressures of intense TCs are not realistically simulated in the model, geographical patterns of TS formation seem to be realistically simulated, with climatological and El Nino/La Nina SST conditions. A series of experiments is conducted with doubled CO2 and with increased SSTs. A spatial pattern of SST, made by uniform 2 K warming, is used for experiments with both of the cumulus parameterizations. El Nino-like and La Nina-like warming patterns of SSTs, are used with the Arakawa-Schubert scheme. In these global warming experiments, frequency of TS formation decreases by 9.0-18.4% globally, and some of these changes are statistically significant. While no coherent changes in global frequency of relatively intense TCs (e.g., maximum surface wind >= 25 m s(-1)) are found in the warm-climate experiments, significant reduction in the total frequency of TSs and TDs resulted from all of these experiments. The results suggest that global frequency of relatively weak TCs may decrease in the future warm climate, but frequency of intense storms may either decrease or increase. Mean precipitation near TC centers is significantly heavier in the warming experiments than in the present-day experiments, as compared for TCs with the same maximum wind speed..",0
"One of file most significant anticipated consequences of global climate change is the change in Frequency of hydrological extremes. Predictions of climate change impacts oil the regime of hydrological extremes have traditionally been conducted by a top-down approach that involves a high degree of uncertainty associated with the temporal and spatial characteristics of general circulation model (GCM) Outputs and the choice of downscaling technique. This Study uses the inverse approach to model hydrological risk and Vulnerability to changing climate conditions in the Seyhan River basin, Turkey. With close collaboration with the end users, the approach first identifies critical hydrological exposures that may lead to local failures in the Seyhan River basin. The Hydro-BEAM hydrological model is used to inversely transform the main hydrological exposures, such as floods and droughts, into corresponding meteorological conditions. The frequency of critical meteorological conditions is investigated under present and future climate scenarios by means of a weather generator based oil the improved K-nearest neighbour algorithm, The weather generator, linked with the Output of GCMS in the last step of the proposed methodology, allows for the creation of all ensemble of scenarios and easy Updating when improved GCM Outputs become available. Two main conclusions were drawn from the application of the inverse approach to the Seyhan River basin. First, floods of 100-, 200- and 300-year return periods under present conditions will have 102-, 293- and 1370-year return periods under the future conditions; that is, critical flood events will occur much less frequently under the changing climate conditions. Second, the drought return period will change from 5.3 years under present conditions to 2.0 years tinder the future conditions that is, critical drought events will occur Much more frequently under the changing climate conditions.",0
"Repeated predictions that vector-borne disease prevalence will increase with global warming are usually based on univariate models. To accommodate the full range of constraints, the present-day distribution of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEv) was matched statistically to current climatic variables, to provide a multivariate description of present-day areas of disease risk. This was then applied to outputs of a general circulation model that predicts how climatic variables may change in the future, and future distributions of TBEv were predicted for them. The expected summer rise in temperature and decrease in moisture appears to drive the distribution of TBEv into higher-latitude and higher-altitude regions progressively through the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. The final toe-hold in the 2080s may be confined to a small part of Scandinavia, including new foci in southern Finland. The reason for this apparent contraction of the range of TBEv is that its transmission cycles depend on a particular pattern of tick seasonal dynamics, which may be disrupted by climate change. The observed marked increase in incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in most parts of Europe since 1993 may be due to non-biological causes, such as political and sociological changes.",0
"PALEOCLIMATE AND FAUNAL EVOLUTION IN THE PLIO-PLEISTOCENE OF AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA. Climatic change is often hypothesized to be a major variable in forcing evolutionary change. Recent work on Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil mammals from the Turkana Basin of Kenya and Ethiopia shows that climate may play an important role in the spread of savanna environments, and thus in the increasing abundance of mammals adapted to open and seasonally and conditions. If global climate change is behind some of these trends in East Africa, we hypothesize that similar patterns of faunal change may occur elsewhere. An analysis of fossil mammals from the Pampean region of Argentina shows an increase in the number of species adapted to open and seasonally and conditions through the Plio-Pleistocene. The South American pattern is not identical to the East African pattern, but both show a significant increase in open and and adapted mammals shortly after 2 million years ago, at the very beginning of the Pleistocene. Although global climate change may be invoked as a common cause of these intercontinental trends, local and regional geography and tectonics play a critical role in modulating the global signal.",0
"The aim of this study has been to estimate the carbon footprint of bread produced and consumed in the UK. Sliced white and wholemeal bread has been considered for these purposes and the functional unit is defined as ""one loaf of sliced bread (800 g) consumed at home"". The influence on the carbon footprint of several parameters has been analysed, including country of origin of wheat (UK, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and USA), type of flour (white, brown and wholemeal) and type of packaging (plastic and paper bags). The effect on the results of the type of data (primary and secondary) has also been considered. The carbon footprint has been estimated in accordance with the PAS 2050 methodology. The results have also been calculated following the ISO 14044 methodology to identify any differences in the two approaches and the results. Primary data for the PAS 2050-compliant study have been collected from a UK bread supply chain. Secondary data have been sourced from the UK statistics, life cycle inventory databases and other published sources. The carbon footprint results range from 977 to 1,244 g CO2 eq. per loaf of bread. Wholemeal thick-sliced bread packaged in plastic bags has the lowest carbon footprint and white medium-sliced bread in paper bag the highest. The main hot spots are wheat cultivation and consumption of bread (refrigerated storage and toasting), contributing 35% and 25% to the total, respectively. The carbon footprint could be reduced on average by 25% by avoiding toasting and refrigerated storage of bread. Further reductions (5-10%) could be achieved by reducing the amount of waste bread discarded by consumers. The contribution of transport and packaging to the overall results is small. Similar trends in the results are also found in the study based on the secondary data and following the ISO 14044 methodology.",0
"The emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) from ship engines constitute an increasing part of the total global emissions of NO(x) while the share from land-based sources is decreasing. In the coming years, new regulations will set limits to emissions in specific areas and various technical countermeasures will be developed and implemented. However, when taking technical measures against emissions on a local scale, there is always a risk of inducing an increase in the total environmental impact related to the technology used, owing to increased energy use and emissions in other places. In the present study, an investigation of the difference in environmental impact from passenger transport vessels with and without catalytic NO(x) emission purification was performed in a life cycle assessment. The production and transport of chemicals used in the catalyst are included in the study. The study shows that the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) gives a considerable decrease in the environmental impact compared with using a diesel engine without a catalyst. The transport of urea solution over a 500 km distance makes a very small contribution to the total environmental impact. The global warming potential is the only impact category for which values are increased when including the urea production and transport. When looking at the contribution from urea to the total impact from the SCR process, the increase is less than 10 per cent for most impact categories.",0
"A Louisiana rice soil was incubated from the most oxidizing to the most reducing conditions that could be maintained. Four different pH levels were used. Nitrous oxide production initiated shortly after the incubation started under oxidized conditions. As the soil suspension became more reducing, a large amount of CH4 was produced at a critical reducing point and increased exponentially with a further decrease of redox potential (E-H). The results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the theoretically predicted decrease of E-H with increase of pH and the observed change of E-H with pH for N2O production (60 mV, P=0.932), and for significant CH4 production (93 mV, P=0.204), respectively. Consequently, the E-H range with minimum N2O and CH4 production shifted to lower values of the E-H scale when pH increased. Global warming potential (GWP) contribution from the studied soil mainly comes from N2O production at moderately reducing conditions, and from CH4 production under very reducing conditions. There was a slight production of CH4 at high E(H)s soon after incubation started, but this CH4 production was not a significant source of GWP from soils because of its small quantity and transient occurrence. If pH is neutral, the calculated E-H range with minimum GWP is generally in the range of -150 to +180 mV. This redox window accounts for >40% of the entire E-H range in this study, which makes appropriate management of irrigated rice fields possible that will minimize both N2O and CH4 production.",0

"To separate the effects of heat stress on male and female reproductive tissues, male-sterile (MSs) and male-fertile tomatoes (MFs) were placed in growth chambers at 12 h day/12 h night temperatures of 28/22, 30/24 or 32/26 degrees C from newer appearance to seed maturation (daily mean temperatures of 25, 27 or 29 degrees C). pollen from MFs was applied individually to MS flowers. As MFs were self-pollinated, heat stress was experienced by both male and female tissues. At growth temperatures of 29 degrees C fruit number, fruit weight per plant, and seed number per fruit were only 10%, 6.4% and 16.4%, respectively, compared with those at 25 degrees C, Heat stress also adversely affected fruitset in MSs, especially when experienced by donor pollen. No fruit at all developed on MSs receiving pollen produced at 29 degrees C, even when ovule development, pollen germination and subsequent embryo development all took place at 25 degrees C, Effects on fruitset in MSs were reduced if donor pollen had not experienced heat stress. MSs grown at 29 degrees C but receiving pollen developing at 25 degrees C produced 73% as much fruit (both on number and weight basis), had 40% as high fruitset and produced 87% of the seed per fruit as MSs grown at 25 degrees C, This use of male-sterile and male-fertile lines of tomato provides new evidence that impairment of pollen and anther development by elevated temperature will be an important contributing factor to decreased fruit set in tomato, and possibly other crops, with global warming.",0
"We present the first continent-wide analysis of the population trends of European breeding birds to show that populations of Afro-Palearctic migrant birds have shown a pattern of sustained, often severe, decline. The mean trend of inter-continental migrants was significantly negative between 1970 and 1990 and non-significantly so between 1990 and 2000. Mean population trends were positively correlated between periods, suggesting little change in the trajectory of most migrant species' populations over this 30-year period. In both periods, trends of inter-continental migrants were significantly more negative than those of short-distance migrants or residents. This negative trend appeared to be largely, although not entirely, due to declines in species wintering in dry, open habitats in Africa. Analyses of trends of 30 closely related pairs of species, one a long-distance migrant and the other not, indicated significantly more negative trends in the former, irrespective of breeding habitat. Conservation action to address these declines is required under the Convention on Migratory Species and the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy, to which most European countries are signatories and which aim, respectively, to conserve migratory species and to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Our results indicate that more conservation action may be required outside Europe to achieve these targets. Further research is needed to assess whether the declines are caused by factors operating on the birds' wintering grounds, breeding grounds or on migration routes, and to identify ways to reverse them.

"Biofuel is one candidate that can address the global warming and energy security challenges faced by the transportation sector. However, biofuel production is subject to unpredictable external disturbances caused by demand variation, regional instability and extreme weather. It is highly desired to design a biofuel plant such that it has operational flexibility to survive through these disturbances. Gasification based thermo-chemical conversion is one of the promising approaches: the plant can produce a variety of products including electricity, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, and diesel while taking almost any kind of biomass as feedstock. In this paper, technical and economic performance of thermo-chemical biofuel plants is evaluated under external disturbances, including extreme weather, market fluctuation, and policy uncertainties. Four plant configurations with varying electricity generation capacity and different in-plant hydrogen production methods (methane autothermal reforming or water-gas shifting) are considered. It has been found that by providing additional electricity production capacity and producing hydrogen via methane reforming, the biofuel plant could have the best chance to maximize profit under external disturbances. Results from this research are expected to help relevant biofuel stakeholders, i.e. investors, plant managers, and government agencies, to make key decisions with regards to investment, plant operation, as well as policy.

"Results from time-slice ensemble experiments using a T106 AGCM revealed changes in the South Asian summer monsoon resulting from climate change. Model results under global warming conditions suggested more warming over land than over the ocean, a northward shift of lower tropospheric monsoon circulation, and an increase in mean precipitation during the Asian summer monsoon. The number of extreme daily precipitation events increased significantly. Increases in mean and extreme precipitation were attributed to greater atmospheric moisture content ( a thermodynamic change). In contrast, dynamic changes limited the intensification of mean precipitation. Enhanced extreme precipitation over land in South Asia arose from dynamic changes rather than thermodynamic changes.",0
"Biogas utilization has undergone great development in rural China since the government systematically popularized household-scale biogas digesters for meeting the rural energy needs in the 1970s. In order to comprehensively estimate the significance of biogas utilization on rural energy development and greenhouse gas emission reduction, all types of energy sources, including straw, fuelwood, coal, refined oil, electricity, LPG, natural gas, and coal gas, which were substituted by biogas, were analyzed based on the amount of consumption for the years from 1991 to 2005. It was found that biogas provided 832749.13 TJ of energy for millions of households. By the employment of biogas digesters, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) was estimated to be 73157.59Gg CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq), and the emission by the biogas combustion was only 36372.75Gg CO2-eq of GHG. Energy substitution and manure management, working in combination, had reduced the GHG emission efficiently. The majority of the emission reduction was achieved by energy substitution that reduced 84243.94Gg CO2, 3560.01Gg CO2-eq of CH4 and 260.08Gg CO2-eq of N2O emission. It was also predicted that the total production of biogas would reach to 15.6 billion m(3) in the year 2010 and 38.5 billion m; in the year 2020, respectively. As a result, the GHG emission reductions are expected to reach 289904 and 46794.90Gg CO2-eq, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Nitrogen (N) availability is the main constraint on primary production in most Arctic ecosystems, with microbial fixation of atmospheric N as the primary source of N input. However, there are only few reports on N fixation rates in relation to climate change in the Arctic. In order to investigate the effects of anticipated global climate change on N fixation rates in a subarctic moist heath, a field experiment was carried out in Northern Sweden. Warming was induced by plastic tents, and in order to simulate the effects of future increased tree cover, birch litter was added each fall for 9 years before the measurements. We analyzed N fixation rates on both whole-ecosystem level and specifically on two moss species: Sphagnum warnstorfii and Hylocomium splendens. The whole-ecosystem N fixation of the warmed plots almost tripled compared with the control plots. However, in the Sphagnum and Hylocomium mosses we observed either no change or occasionally even a decrease in N fixation after warming. Both measured on whole-ecosystem level and on the two moss species separately, litter addition increased N fixation rates. The results suggest that warming will lead to a general increased ecosystem N input, but also that the N fixation associated to some moss species is likely to decrease. Hence, this study shows that the scale of measurements is crucial when investigating on ecosystem responses to manipulations.",0
"Main Atlantic and Pacific commercial species of the subtropic, subarctic and arctic zones - Atlantic and Pacific herring; Atlantic cod; European, South African, Peruvian, Japanese and Californian sardine; South African and Peruvian Anchovy; Pacific salmon; Alaska pollock; Chilean jack mackerel and some others - undergo long-term simultaneous oscillations. The total catch of these highly abundant species equals about 50 percent of the total Atlantic and Pacific marine fish harvest. The dynamics of northern hemispheric surface air temperature anomaly (dT) can hardly be correlated with long-term dynamics of marine commercial fish production because of high inter-annual variability. The so called atmospheric circulation index (ACI) characterizing a dominant direction of air mass transport was found to be closely related with long-term fluctuations of the main commercial stocks. This index has been registered over the Northern Hemisphere or more than 100 years using the Wangengeim-Girs method. Correlation coefficients between commercial catches and ACI dynamics in the period of 1900-1994, stayed in the range of 0.70-0.90. The global character of the ACI dynamics is confirmed by its close correlation with such global geophysical characteristics as the earth rotation velocity index (ERVI). Approximately 50-70 year simultaneous cycles were observed in stock dynamics of the main commercial species, ACI and ERVI. The dynamics of main commercial stocks in both Atlantic and Pacific follow the alternation of the so-called circulation epochs (meridional or 'latitudinal'). The long-term changes of dT, ACI, ERVI and commercial stock dynamics display the beginning of new climate-production phase similar to that of 1950-1970s. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

"The recent rapid mass loss of mountain glaciers in response to climate warming has been reported for high and low latitudes all over the Earth. The paper analyses and discusses the recent evolution of a representative glacierized group within the Italian Alps, the Piazzi-DosdS, where small glaciers are experiencing considerable retreat and shrinking. We analysed aerial photos to calculate area and geometry changes in the time window 1954-2003, and glaciological and geomorphological surveys were also performed. The estimated area change during 1954-2003 was -3.97 km(2) (-51% of the area coverage in 1954). Area reduction increased more recently: area change during 1991-2003 (12 years) was -74 km(2), against -0.67 km(2) during 1981-1991 (10 years), and -57 km (2) during 1954-1981 (27 years). Moreover, analysis of the most recent orthophotos acquired during the summer of 2003 under exceptional conditions (i.e. total absence of snow cover) allowed observation and mapping of changes affecting glacier shape and morphology, including growing rock outcrops, tongue separations, formation of proglacial lakes, increasing supraglacial debris and collapse structures. Such processes cause positive feedbacks that accelerate further glacier disintegration once they appear. From a geodynamical perspective, the DosdS Piazzi is now experiencing transition from a glacial system to a paraglacial one; areas where in the past the shaping and driving factors were glaciers are now subject to the action of melting water, slope evolution and periglacial processes.",0
"The potential impact of climate change on forest distribution in Sri Lanka was evaluated. The Holdridge Life Zone Classification was used along with current climate and climate change scenarios derived from two general circulation models, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model and the Canadian Climate Centre Model, at a 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution. Current and future distributions of life zones were mapped with a Geographic Information System. These maps were then used to calculate the extent of the impact areas for the climate change scenarios. The current distribution pattern of forest vegetation includes tropical very dry forest (6%), tropical dry forest (56%), and tropical wet forest (38%). Results obtained using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model show an increase in tropical dry forest (8%) and decrease in tropical wet forest (2%). The Canadian Climate Centre Model scenario predicted an increase in tropical very dry forest (5%) and tropical dry forest (7%), and a decrease in tropical wet forest (11%). Both models predicted a northward shift of tropical wet forest into areas currently occupied by tropical dry forest The application of general circulation models such as the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model and the Canadian Climate Centre Model, as well as the Holdridge Life Zone Classification, to estimate the effect of climate change on Sri Lankan forests in this paper indicates that these methods are suitable as a tool for such investigations in Sri Lanka.",0
"Human-induced disturbances may threaten the viability of many turtle populations, including populations of North American box turtles. Evaluation of the potential impacts of these disturbances can be aided by long-term studies of populations subject to minimal human activity. In such a population of ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata) in western Nebraska, we examined survival rates and population growth rates from 1981-2000 based on mark-recapture data. The average annual apparent survival rate of adult males was 0.883 (SE = 0.021) and of adult females was 0.932 (SE = 0.014). Minimum winter temperature was the best of five climate variables as a predictor of adult survival. Survival rates were highest in years with low minimum winter temperatures, Suggesting that global warming pay result in declining survival. We estimated an average adult population growth rate ((lambda) over cap) of 006 (SE = 0.065), with an estimated temporal process variance ((lambda) over cap (2)) of 0.029 (95% CI = 0.005-0.176). Stochastic simulations suggest that this mean and temporal process variance would result in a 58% probability of a population decrease over a 20-year period. This research provides evidence that, unless unknown density-dependent mechanisms are operating in the adult age class, significant human disturbances, such Is commercial harvest or turtle mortality on roads, represent a potential risk to box turtle populations.",0
"The purpose of this study is to investigate the variations and trends in the long-term annual mean air temperatures by using graphical and statistical time-series methods. The study covers a 63-year period starting from 1930 and uses temperature records from 85 climate stations. First, spatial distributions of the annual mean temperatures and coefficients of variation are studied in order to show normal conditions of the long-term annual mean temperatures. Then variations and trends observed in the annual mean temperatures are investigated using temperature data from 71 climate stations and regional mean series. Various non-parametric tests are used to detect abrupt changes and trends in the long-term mean temperatures of both geographical regions within Turkey and individual stations. The analyses indicate some noticeable variations and significant trends in the long-term annual mean temperatures. Among the geographical regions, only Eastern Anatolia appears to show similar behaviour to the global warming trends, except in the last 5 years. All the coastal regions, however, are characterized by cooling trends in the last two decades. Considering the results of the statistical tests applied to the 71 individual stations data, it could be concluded that annual mean temperatures are generally dominated by a cooling tendency in Turkey. The coldest years of the temperature records of the majority of the stations were 1933 and 1992, respectively.",0
"In Part I, the wastewater treatment sector in the Netherlands was analyzed to determine how the degree of separation of COD (BOD), nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals from the wastewater increased over time, and how the proportions of these substances, separated out from the wastewater into the lithosphere and atmosphere, changed over time. This paper applies the same methodology, adopted in the first part, to Norway. Needless to say, the hydrosphere has benefited from a decline in eutrophication and marine/fresh water toxicity, owing to the favourable combination of higher degrees of separation over time and source control, especially in the industrial sector. However, this has been at the expense of damage to the atmosphere (global warming). Technologies have, of course, enabled some mitigation of the problems that have shifted to the atmosphere and lithosphere, though these are beyond the scope of this paper, which assumes a hypothetical worst-case scenario in this regard. Whereas, in Part I, the time period 1993-2005 was considered, this paper is handicapped by the lack of availability of data and is restricted to a much narrower time period: 2002-2006.",0
"The potential impact of global climate change is one of the least addressed factors in water resources planning in developing countries. The potential impacts of climate change are examined for Jordan, where a methodology is presented for improved management of water demand under the uncertainties associated with climate change. A temperature/precipitation sensitivity model is constructed and combined with water demand forecasts to project deficits for the year 2020. Deficit reducing options are then evaluated in terms of social and economic viability. The study concludes that only some of the deficits may be alleviated, illustrating the significance of considering climate change in planning for countries that already experience water imbalances.",0
"The Breede River is not a large river by world standards, but is the largest in South Africa's Western Province, and plays a significant part in the province's economy. Models predict that flows into it could be seriously affected by climate change. Accordingly a study was made of trends in flow over recent decades, in the hope that any trends detected would confirm, or otherwise, the prediction of the models. Data on flows over 30 years at various sites in the Breede Valley were downloaded from the Department of Water Affairs. The data were first checked for consistency. In 2 cases there was evidence that behaviour of the flow had changed, apparently permanently, during the course of the study period (typically the variance of the flow had changed markedly at a particular point in time). The data series was accordingly truncated to make use only of the longest series of consistent records. A simple, robust technique was then employed to detect the trends. The data at each site had a log-normal distribution, and linear regression of the log-transformed data was used to detect the trend. An F-test showed that in all cases the trends were significant; in one case a t-test indicated the detected trend was of low significance, but all others were highly significant. The results are discussed in terms of land use changes being a dominant factor in flows in the Breede River system, to an extent that should not have been ignored in attempting to use the data to predict future flows. Indeed, only one of the sites used in the study had a pristine watershed, and that showed a 14% increase in flow over the study period, contrary to the climate change predictions. There had earlier been a suggestion that climate change might be responsible for the changes in flows. It is generally recognised that climate change models cannot yet account for local climate change effects. Predictions of possible adverse local impacts from global climate change should therefore be treated with the greatest caution. Above all, they must not form the basis for any policy decisions until such time as they can reproduce known climatic effects satisfactorily.",0
"By the end of the century, climate change projections under a ""business-as-usual"" emissions scenario suggest a globally averaged warming of 2.4-6.4 degrees C. If these forecasts are realized, cropping systems are likely to experience significant geographic range transformations among damaging endemic weed species and new vulnerabilities to exotic weed invasions. To anticipate these changes and to devise management strategies for proactively addressing them, it is necessary to characterize the environmental conditions that make specific weed species abundant, competitive, and therefore damaging the production of particular crops (i.e. defining the damage niche). In this study, U.S. maize is used as a model system to explore the implications of climate change on the distribution of damaging agricultural weeds. To accomplish this, we couple ensemble climate change projections of annual temperature and precipitation with survey data of troublesome weed species in maize. At the state scale, space-for-time substitution techniques are used to suggest the potential magnitude of change among damaging weed communities. To explore how the geography of damage for specific species may evolve over the next century, bioclimatic range rules were derived for two weed species that are pervasive in the Northern (Abutilon theophrasti Medicus, ABUTH) and Southern (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers., SORHA) U.S. Results from both analyses suggest that the composition of damaging weed communities may be fundamentally altered by climate change. In some states, potential changes in the coming decades are commensurate to those possible by the end of the century. Regions such as the Northeastern U.S. may prove particularly vulnerable with emerging climate conditions favoring few weed species of present-day significance. In contrast, regions like the mid-South are likely to experience fewer shifts even with a similar magnitude in climate change. By the end of the century in the U.S. Corn Belt, cold-tolerant species likeA. theophrasti may be of minor importance whereas S. halepense, a predominantly Southern U.S. weed species at present, may become common and damaging to maize production with its damage niche advancing 200-600 km north of its present-day distribution.

"The knowledge of tropical palaeoclimates is crucial for understanding global climate change, because it is a test bench for general circulation models that are ultimately used to predict future global warming. A longstanding issue concerning the last glacial maximum in the tropics is the discrepancy between the decrease in sea-surface temperatures reconstructed from marine proxies and the high-elevation decrease in land temperatures estimated from indicators of treeline elevation. In this study, an improved inverse vegetation modeling approach is used to quantitatively reconstruct palaeoclimate and to estimate the effects of different factors (temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentration) on changes in treeline elevation based on a set of pollen data covering an altitudinal range from 100 to 3,140 m above sea level in Africa. We show that lowering of the African treeline during the last glacial maximum was primarily triggered by regional drying, especially at upper elevations, and was amplified by decreases in atmospheric CO2 concentration and perhaps temperature. This contrasts with scenarios for the Holocene and future climates, in which the increase in treeline elevation will be dominated by temperature. Our results suggest that previous temperature changes inferred from tropical treeline shifts may have been overestimated for low-CO2 glacial periods, because the limiting factors that control changes in treeline elevation differ between glacial and interglacial periods.",0
"The Steel Industry has decreased its emissions of greenhouse gases by a factor of 3 in the last 30 years, However, the prospect of Global Warming, even if it is still a matter of controversy, makes it necessary to explore the issue further, Increasing steel recycling, i,e, the use of scrap, would be the most realistic near-term answer of the Steel Industry to a further decrease in CO2 emissions. In the long term, some interesting R&D paths are left open.",0
"We at Mitsubishi have lined up Gen-III+ solutions for a wide variety of global customers: ATMEAI of the 1100MWe class and an APWR with the largest capacity of 1700MWe. In this paper, we would like to introduce the APWR. With an increased requirement for nuclear power generation as an effective countermeasure against global warming, we have established the APWR plant, a large-capacity Mitsubishi standard reactor combining our accumulated experience and technology as an integrated PWR plant supplier. The APWR plant has achieved high reliability, safety and enhanced economy based oil a technology that has been developed with the Support of the government and utilities through improvement and standardization programs of light water reactors. Currently, Tsuruga Units 3 and 4, the first two APWRs, are undergoing licensing, while we are making efforts to obtain the standard design certification (DC) of US-APWR and preparing for the European Utility Requirements (EUR) compliance assessment of EU-APWR. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI) positions the APWR as I core technology that will contribute to the prevention of global warming and meet worldwide requirements.",0
"Ultraviolet solar radiation (UVR) and atmospheric nutrient loads to pristine ecosystems are global climate change phenomena that simultaneously affect aquatic organisms in ways not easily predicted by single factor studies. Plankton in a high mountain lake was exposed in situ to increasing phosphorus (P) concentrations (mimicking atmospheric pulses) in absence or presence of UVR in order to identify their interactive effect on functional [primary production, organic carbon (C) release (EOC), and percentage of C released (%EOC)], growth rate, structural-physiological (algal biomass, sestonic C, P content, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Chl a:C ratio, P cell quota, cell-specific Chl a), and stoichiometric (autotroph C: P ratio) traits. The availability of P after the pulse determined the intensity of responses by primary producers to UVR stress. All structural-physiological and functional variables significantly increased by up to two orders of magnitude in response to P enrichment. UV radiation, over a long-term scale, exerted significant deleterious effects on most structural-physiological variables when inorganic P was added at high levels (>= 30 mu g PL-1). The subsequent unexpected negative synergistic UVR x P effect on algal development did not support our initial hypothesis that P input might buffer the harmful UVR effect. UVR exerted a weak negative effect on primary production but strongly enhanced the absolute and percentage excretion of C (up to 60%), mechanism responsible of a significant reduction in autotroph C: P ratios. We propose that low sestonic C:P ratios are the outcome of an adaptive strategy of algae in environments with high UVR exposure and extreme nutrient limitation and have important implications for C flux through grazing vs. microbial food webs in oligotrophic systems.",0
"Species reintroduction programmes, in prioritizing areas for reintroductions, have traditionally used tools that include measures of habitat suitability and evaluations of area requirements for viable populations. Here we add two tools to this approach: evaluation of ecological requirements of species and evaluation of future suitability for species facing changing climates. We demonstrate this approach with two species for which reintroduction programmes are in the planning stages in Mexico: California condor Gymnogyps californianns and Mexican wolf Canis lupus baileyi. For the condor, we identify three areas clustered in the Sierra San Pedro Martir, Baja California; for the wolf, we identify a string of suitable sites along the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Mexico. We discuss the limitations of this approach, identifying ways in which the models illustrated could be made more realistic and directly useful to reintroduction programmes.",0
"In this study, we used two novel methods to estimate urban contamination in the Japanese temperature record of the last century. First, we tested different criteria for choosing the rural stations, and found little sensitivity to the method, though the presence of a decreasing local population trend appeared to be a useful indicator. Second, we investigated the relationship between the regional sea surface temperature (SST) and surface air temperature over land, and found a very strong relationship across the coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 multi-model ensemble. Applying this relationship to observational SST data indicates little or no contamination of the trends from the stations identified as rural. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society",0
The structural changes in bacterial communities were investigated in the model experiment on the gradual decrease in moisture content for a soddy gleysol from the Central Forest State Biosphere Reserve under two different regimes. The slow drying in the desiccator caused a smooth decrease in bacterial population and diversity. Soil drying increased the relative generic abundance of actinobacteria and bacilli. The transformations identified in bacterial communities are expected to occur under natural conditions in the case of possible global warming.,0
"Purpose - The widely accepted view that global warming is man-made and largely due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been disputed in a powerful and closely argued ""critique"" reviewed here, including some retraction by James Lovelock. Attention is drawn to a new online video on the life and contributions of the economist Adam Smith, and to development of the smallest-ever diamond transistor. The death of the experimental psychologist Richard Gregory is reported. Design/methodology/approach - The aim is to review developments on the internet, especially those of general cybernetic interest. Findings - The main finding is that currently accepted views of anthropomorphic global warming are subject to serious doubt. Practical implications - It seems likely that the ""greenhouse"" effect of carbon dioxide can be discounted, allowing major revisions of energy policy and increased exploitation of fossil fuel resources, though with attention also to renewable sources that will be needed when the fossil fuels run out. The diamond transistor will eventually allow increase in speed in digital devices. Originality/value - It is hoped this is a valuable periodic review.",0
"The deforestation and degradation of tropical forests are taking place at an extremely rapid pace. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the estimated annual rate of tropical deforestation during the 1981-1985 period was 113 846 square kilometers or 0.6% of the 1981 total forested area. The implications of the loss of these forests are staggering (Myers, N., 1989. Deforestation Rates in Tropical Forests and Their Climatic Implications. Friends of the Earth, London). Tropical forests are extremely rich ecosystems which support a disproportionately large share of the world's plant and animal species. Forests play a crucial role in both nutrient and hydrological cycling and may provide sustainable economic benefits through managed harvesting of timber and the collection of non-timber products such as fruits, nuts, and rubber. Also, deforestation is a significant source of global warming through its effects on the global carbon cycle. This paper focuses on the relationship between debt and deforestation, examining conceptual and empirical arguments that debt is a source of deforestation pressure. Our study develops a behavioral model which suggests that debt can lead to myopic behavior, leading to deforestation rates that may not be optimal in the long run, but are necessary in the short run to meet current constraints. Then, country-by-country data on debt, deforestation, and other variables are analyzed with regression analysis. It is shown that debt is significantly correlated with deforestation under a wide variety of assumptions and specifications. Our results indicate that debt is an important factor in the deforestation of tropical countries. There are certainly other sources of deforestation, both micro- and macroeconomic, which may vary significantly from country to country. However, we focus on debt because of its dominant role in the economies of developing countries, and because of the increased use of debt-for-nature swaps. The link between debt and deforestation that is suggested in this paper implies that debt-for-nature swaps may have a dual effect on deforestation. First, the contractual agreement is designed to preserve forests as part of the swap. Second, the reduction in debt may itself reduce the pressure to deforest, although this indirect effect is small. Our research provides evidence that reducing debt reduces deforestation, which may be an argument to offer deforesting third-world countries some form of debt relief, and to utilize more fully debt-for-nature swaps as a tool for preserving environmental quality.",0
"There is some debate about the likelihood that soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of agricultural land decreases because of global warming and governmental restrictions on animal manure application rates in some countries. Here, we report on changes in the mean SOC contents of the top soils (0-5 cm) of grassland and the top soil (0-25 cm) of arable land in the Netherlands during the period 1984-2004, using a data base with similar to 2 million results of SOC determinations from farmers' fields. The analyses were made for all agricultural land on mineral soils and for agricultural land in 9 regions with distinct differences in mean soil textures and SOC contents (marine and riverine clay, peaty clays, reclaimed peat soils, and Aeolian sand and loess), and land uses (arable land and permanent grassland). Except for the regions with peaty clay and reclaimed peat soils, samples with SOC>125 g/kg were designated as peat and peaty soils and excluded from the analyses. Mean SOC content of soils under arable land in 2003 ranged from 13 to 22 g/kg for sand, loess and clay soils to 59 g/kg for reclaimed peat soils. Mean SOC content of soils under permanent grassland in 2003 ranged from 22 to 56 g/kg for sand and clay soils. The difference in mean SOC contents between grassland and arable land is in part related to the difference in sampling depth. Mean SOC contents of all mineral soils under grasslands and arable land tended to increase annually by 0.10 and 0.08 g/kg, respectively. We observed large differences in mean trends between regions. Regions with relatively low SOC contents tended to accrue C by up to 0.37 g/kg/year, while regions with relatively high SOC contents (e.g., peaty clays) tended to lose C by up to 0.98 g/kg/year. In conclusion, mean SOC contents of the top part of mineral soils of agricultural land in most regions in the Netherlands tended to increase slightly during the period 1984-2004. This result contrasts with reports from e.g., United Kingdom and Belgium that suggest decreasing C stocks in arable land possibly due to changes in land use and climate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"The consistency of tropical tropospheric temperature trends with climate model expectations remains contentious. A key limitation is that the uncertainties in observations from radiosondes are both substantial and poorly constrained. We present a thorough uncertainty analysis of radiosonde-based temperature records. This uses an automated homogenization procedure and a previously developed set of complex error models where the answer is known a priori. We perform a number of homogenization experiments in which error models are used to provide uncertainty estimates of real-world trends. These estimates are relatively insensitive to a variety of processing choices. Over 1979-2003, the satellite-equivalent tropical lower tropospheric temperature trend has likely (5-95% confidence range) been between -0.01 K/decade and 0.19 K/decade (0.05-0.23 K/decade over 1958-2003) with a best estimate of 0.08 K/decade (0.14 K/decade). This range includes both available satellite data sets and estimates from models (based upon scaling their tropical amplification behavior by observed surface trends). On an individual pressure level basis, agreement between models, theory, and observations within the troposphere is uncertain over 1979 to 2003 and nonexistent above 300 hPa. Analysis of 1958-2003, however, shows consistent model-data agreement in tropical lapse rate trends at all levels up to the tropical tropopause, so the disagreement in the more recent period is not necessarily evidence of a general problem in simulating long-term global warming. Other possible reasons for the discrepancy since 1979 are: observational errors beyond those accounted for here, end-point effects, inadequate decadal variability in model lapse rates, or neglected climate forcings.",0
"Recent strategies to sustain fish stocks have Suggested a move towards an ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM) approach. While EBFM considers the effect of fishing at the ecosystem level, it generally struggles with climate-driven environmental variability, In this Study we show that the position of a fish stock within its distributional range or thermal niche (we use Icelandic and North Sea cod as examples of stocks at the centre and edge of their niche, respectively) will influence the relative importance of fishing and climate on abundance. At the warmer edge of the thermal niche of cod in the North Sea, we show a prominent influence of climate oil the cod stock that is mediated through temperature effects on the plankton. In contrast, the influence of climate through its effects on plankton appears much less important at the present centre of the niche around Iceland. Recognising the potentially strong effect. of climate on fish stocks, at a time of rapid global climate change, is probably an important prerequisite towards the synthesis of a cod management strategy.",0
"Water samples were analyzed from ponds developed within the debris-covered area of Lirung Glacier (28 degrees 12.9 degrees N, 86 degrees 39.9 degrees E; 4000 m a.s.l.) in the Himalayas of Nepal during the pre-monsoon to post-monsoon period of 1996. Major chemical species were classified into three groups based on their relationships relative to the sum of cations: conservative (SiO2, Ca2+, K, and Alkalinity), semiconservative (Na+, Mg2+, and SO42-) and non-conservative (NH4+, NP3- and Cl-). The dominant processes determining the chemical composition of glacier pond water were sulfide oxidation coupled with carbonate dissolution and chemical weathering of aluminosilicate as indicated by the conservative and semi-conservative species. Calcium and alkalinity appeared as the dominant cation and anion, respectively, among all samples within the basin. Compared to the discharge waters at the outlet of the glacier, most of these pond waters have lower major solutes as well as alkalinity. The availability of fresh reactive minerals at the base of the glacier, coupled with higher temperature in discharge waters than in the ponds, may be the prime factors resulting in higher concentrations of most solutes in the discharge waters than in the ponds. In the ponds, higher concentrations of major solutes as well as alkalinity were observed in the monsoon than the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, suggesting the role of hydrolysis condition in chemical weathering rates. Ponds within the debris area of Lirung glacier in central Nepal Himalaya are likely to increase in importance if global warming accelerates the rate of glacial melting.",0
"The emergence of C4 photosynthesis in plants as a significant component of terrestrial ecosystems is thought to be an adaptive response to changes in atmospheric CO(2) concentration and/or climate during Neogene times and has had a profound effect on the global terrestrial biosphere. Although expansion of C4 grasses in the latest Miocene and Pliocene has been widely documented around the world, the spatial and temporal variations in the C4 expansion are still not well understood and its driving mechanisms remain a contentious issue. Here we present the results of carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of fossil and modern mammalian tooth enamel samples from the central Inner Mongolia. Our samples represent a diverse group of herbivorous mammals including deer, elephants, rhinos, horses and giraffes, ranging in age from the late Oligocene to modern. The delta(13)C values of 91 tooth enamel samples of early late-Miocene age or older, with the exception of two 13 Ma rhino samples (-7.8 and -7.6 parts per thousand) and one 8.5 Ma suspected rhino sample (-7.6 parts per thousand), were all less than -8.0 parts per thousand (VPDB), indicating that there were no C4 grasses present in their diets and thus probably few or no C4 grasses in the ecosystems of the central Inner Mongolia prior to similar to 8 Ma. However, 12 out of 26 tooth enamel samples of younger ages (similar to 7.5 Ma to similar to 3.9 Ma) have delta(13)C values higher than -8.0 parts per thousand (up to - 2.4 parts per thousand), indicating that herbivores in the area had variable diets ranging from pure C3 to mixed C3-C4 vegetation during that time interval. The presence of C4 grasses in herbivores' diets (up to similar to 76% C4) suggests that C4 grasses were a significant component of the local ecosystems in the latest Miocene and early Pliocene, consistent with the hypothesis of a global factor as the driving mechanism of the late Miocene C4 expansion. Today, C3 grasses dominate grasslands in the central Inner Mongolia area. The retreat of C4 grasses from this area after the early Pliocene may have been driven by regional climate change associated with tectonic processes in central Asia as well as global climate change.

"Rising temperatures and increasing drought severity linked to global climate change are negatively impacting forest growth and function at the equatorial range edge of species distributions. Rapid dieback and range retractions are predicted to occur in many areas as temperatures continue to rise. Despite widespread negative impacts at the ecosystem level, equatorial range edges are not well studied, and their responses to climate change are poorly understood. Effective monitoring of tree responses to climate in these regions is of critical importance in order to predict and manage threats to populations. Remote sensing of impacts on forests can be combined with ground-based assessment of environmental and ecological changes to identify populations most at risk. Modelling may be useful as a 'first-filter' to identify populations of concern but, together with many remote sensing methods, often lacks adequate resolution for application at the range edge. A multidisciplinary approach, combining remote observation with targeted ground-based monitoring of local susceptible and resistant populations, is therefore required. Once at-risk regions have been identified, management can be adapted to reduce immediate risks in priority populations, and promote long-term adaptation to change. However, management to protect forest ecosystem function may be preferable where the maintenance of historical species assemblages is no longer viable.",0
"Two main mechanisms can potentially explain the spread in the magnitude of global warming simulated by climate models: deep ocean heat uptake and climate feedbacks. Here, we show that deep oceanic heat uptake is a major source of spread in simulations of 21st century climate change. Models with deeper baseline polar mixed layers are associated with larger deep ocean warming and smaller global surface warming. Based on this result, we set forth an observational constraint on polar vertical oceanic mixing. This constraint suggests that many models may overestimate the efficiency of polar oceanic mixing and therefore may underestimate future surface warming. Thus to reduce climate change uncertainties at time-scales relevant for policy-making, improved understanding and modelling of oceanic mixing at high latitudes is crucial. Citation: Boe, J., A. Hall, and X. Qu (2009), Deep ocean heat uptake as a major source of spread in transient climate change simulations, Geophys. Res. Lett., 36, L22701, doi: 10.1029/2009GL040845.",0
"This article explores how researchers can apply social science methods and theoretical frames to capture how place-based communities are perceiving and responding to the immediate effects of global climate change. The study focuses on research with Viliui Sakha-native horse and cattle breeders of northeastern Siberia, Russia, who are increasingly challenged by one of global climate change's most prevalent effects: altered water regimes. By applying the theoretical framework of political ecology, the article shows how researchers can better understand how affected peoples have, in this case, ""water in mind"" via their histories, cosmologies, and management practices of water. Such awareness can inform research activities and findings, facilitate effective adaptation, and, ultimately, affect policy. Given the widespread emphasis on adaptation, including the urgent need for, increasing interest in, and funding support for transdisciplinary research projects on adaptation, and the facilitative role researchers and policymakers can play in adaptation, this move to understanding and integrating a population's shifting perceptions-in this case, of water in mind-into research is fundamental.",0
"There is increasing evidence that some natural disturbances are increasing in frequency and intensity with global change, but the effects of these changes on plant populations is poorly understood. It is estimated that for every 1 degrees C increase in the summer mean minimum temperature, there is a 40% increase in hail damage. Severe hailstorms can cause large impacts on biological communities. In 2008, a strong hailstorm hit the speciose and endemic rupestrian vegetation in Serra do Cipo, Brazil. This event prompted us to record its effects on the narrowly distributed and threatened species Coccoloba cereifera (Polygonaceae). About 33 to 60% of the leaves on the 246 individuals surveyed were lost. The disturbance also influenced some of the physiological traits of C. cereifera, increasing the concentration of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoid) and polyphenols in the leaves. The most pronounced increase of chlorophyll was in young leaves (ca. 60%). Carotenoid content increased by ca. 50% in all leaf ages, while polyphenols increased tenfold. Contrarily, the endophyte richness decreased drastically after the event (from 104 to 33 species), only 12% of similar species remain. The hail storm strongly influenced all variables evaluated in this study, i.e., structure, physiology, and associated fungi. These results show that hailstorm had a dramatic and immediate impact on C. cereifera and may also severely affect other endemic or threatened plant species. Therefore, it is imperative that we broaden our knowledge on global climate change impacts for the conservation of native species.",0
"Initiation of reproduction was investigated in Eurasian Dipper (Cinclus cinclus) along riparian habitat of tributaries flowing into lower Lake Zurich (Switzerland). Total length of these drainages is 40 km and Dippers nested from 410 - 680 in asl. From 1992 to 2000 about 46 pairs per year had 552 successful broods with nestlings of at least 8 to 12 days of age. Meterological data (i. e., air temperature, days with rain, amount of rainfall, amount of sunshine) and water temperature in a study area river were obtained from government weather stations. Phytophenological data, i.e. full flowering of Coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), Wood Anemone (Anemone nemorosa), and Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), were also available from stations within the study area. Dippers initiated breeding in February or March of each year. with considerable variability among years. Earliest oviposition was 9 February 1995, and again 1997, while latest was 9 March 1992. The median date each year for appearance of the first 25 % of all broods was significantly correlated with February water temperatures (Spearman rank correlation. p < 0.001), with February air temperatures (p < 0.002), and with the flowering of two early phanerogams (Coltsfoot and Wood Anemone; p < 0.025), but not Dandelion (p < 0.1). According to historical data, the initiation of reproduction for Dipper at Lake Zurich occurs now earlier in the year than it did in Britain, Germany, and Switzerland. This may be due either to global warming, or (more significantly) to an increase in water temperatures as a result of urbanisation. Warmer waters accelerate life cycles of aquatic arthropods and generate earlier emergences of insects that form the prey base of the Dipper. Since avian reproduction is cued by trophic resources, an earlier appearance of aquatic insects will concomitantly induce an earlier breeding season for the Dipper.",0
"Agaves can grow in marginal arid and semiarid lands where their special ecological and physiological adaptations to environmental conditions give them the potential to produce substantial biomass. Agave americana was the first agave species shown to be a Crassulacean Acid Metabolism plant, with CO2 uptake occurring primarily at night and with high water-use efficiency (photosynthesis/transpiration). A. salmiana and A. mapisaga can have high nocturnal net CO2 uptake rates and high productivities averaging 40 tonnes dry weight ha-1 yr- Agaves can benefit from the increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels accompanying global climate change. An Environmental Productivity Index can predict the effects of soil and environmental factors on CO2 uptake and hence on the regions appropriate for cultivating agaves. In turn, their increased cultivation can support the production of innovative earth-friendly commodities that can be used as new bioenergy feedstocks.",0
"Until the mid 1970s a negative trend in the river now values in the Argentinean provinces of San Juan and Mendoza (Cuyo region) was observed. The prevailing critical conditions and their economic and social impacts provide a basis for the characterization of an adverse climate change scenario for the region. The causes of the early 1970s scenario were assessed in this study in order to determine whether or not it could be related to global warming conditions. River flows are dependent on winter precipitation and on accumulated snow on the Andes cordillera. The lowest negative river flow Value observed can be explained by the behaviour of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and other macroclimatic parameters, such as sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It was observed that the SOI is the parameter most strongly correlated with river flows. The highest correlation was found for the 2.4- and 4.8-yr frequencies and the low 43-yr frequency. Consequently, the low river flow values observed during the early 1970s are considered to be related to a low-frequency minimum of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as well as to the behaviour of sea-surface temperature close to the coast of Chile. Both factors are associated with a minimum hemispheric temperature value. It is concluded that the 1960-70 drought in the eases of the cordillera was not Linked to a warm period. Therefore it is not appropriate, at least for the time being, to state that the eases will experience drought conditions under a global warming scenario with temperature increases of a few degrees.",0
"The Newport Member of the Astoria Formation, exposed on the central Oregon coast, was deposited at shallow marine depths during the Early Miocene global warming that led to the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum. This record thus provides the opportunity to examine a coastal environment over past warming and ask if the low oxygen conditions observed in recent years on the modern Oregon shelf is a recent phenomenon or a repeated symptom of global warming. Although delta O-18 variation can be influenced by freshwater flux, if due to temperature delta O-18 values suggest 2.4-4.5 4.5 degrees C of local warming during deposition of the Newport Member. Species of Buliminacea. Fursenkoina, and Nonionella, abundant in organic-rich, low-oxygen sediments in modern seas, increased in proportional abundance after warming began. In addition, the offset in delta C-13 values between epifaunal to shallow infaunal taxa and a deeper infaunal species is greater in sediments with higher abundances of these taxa, further supporting increased organic carbon flux. An increase in laminated sediments coincident with these faunal and geochemical changes suggests dysoxic conditions accompanied the increase in organic carbon. Taken together, this multiproxy record suggests that high-organic, low-oxygen, environments developed in shallow waters during Early Miocene warming, perhaps driven by similar upwelling mechanisms thought to drive hypoxia on the modern Oregon coast.

"A search has been made for a contribution of the changing cosmic ray intensity to the global warming observed in the last century. The cosmic ray intensity shows a strong 11 year cycle due to solar modulation and the overall rate has decreased since 1900. These changes in cosmic ray intensity are compared to those of the mean global surface temperature to attempt to quantify any link between the two. It is shown that, if such a link exists, the changing cosmic ray intensity contributes less than 8% to the increase in the mean global surface temperature observed since 1900. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Experiments during the past 20 years have shown that bird migration, especially partial migration, is an extremely adaptable life and survival strategy. With selected species - the Blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) and Redstarts (genus Phoenicurus)- it has been shown that all the basic processes and features of migration, such as migratory drive, migratory disposition and activity, and orientation behaviour, are under direct genetic control. The considerable phenotypic and additive genetic variation in these traits provides a great potential for microevolution. Partial migration - the occurrence of migratoriness and sedentariness within the same population - appears to play a major role: it is a turntable, so to speak, for appropriate adaptations. Extremely widespread at higher latitudes and also common in the tropics, partial migration may be a fundamental pattern of avian behaviour. Its phenotypic dichotomy migrant-nonmigrant is caused by a genetic threshold mechanism, on the basis of which full migratoriness or sedentariness can be selected within a few generations. Since incidence and amount of migratory activity clearly represent a genetically integrated migration syndrome, downward selection of migratory activity in exclusively migratory populations resulting in shorter migration distances would also lead to partial migration. Birds are thus evidently capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions by shifting from almost full sedentariness to exclusive migratoriness and vice versa based on selection. Experimental and field evidence indicates that such a shift can be accomplished in less than 50 years, which makes partial migration a highly adaptive trait.",0
"This paper presents the lifecycle assessment (LCA) of fuel ethanol, as 100% of the vehicle fuel, from sugarcane in Brazil. The functional unit is 10,000 km run in an urban area by a car with a 1,600-cm(3) engine running on fuel hydrated ethanol, and the resulting reference flow is 1,000 kg of ethanol. The product system includes agricultural and industrial activities, distribution, cogeneration of electricity and steam, ethanol use during car driving, and industrial by-products recycling to irrigate sugarcane fields. The use of sugarcane by the ethanol agribusiness is one of the foremost financial resources for the economy of the Brazilian rural area, which occupies extensive areas and provides far-reaching potentials for renewable fuel production. But, there are environmental impacts during the fuel ethanol lifecycle, which this paper intents to analyze, including addressing the main activities responsible for such impacts and indicating some suggestions to minimize the impacts. This study is classified as an applied quantitative research, and the technical procedure to achieve the exploratory goal is based on bibliographic revision, documental research, primary data collection, and study cases at sugarcane farms and fuel ethanol industries in the northeast of SA o pound Paulo State, Brazil. The methodological structure for this LCA study is in agreement with the International Standardization Organization, and the method used is the Environmental Design of Industrial Products. The lifecycle impact assessment (LCIA) covers the following emission-related impact categories: global warming, ozone formation, acidification, nutrient enrichment, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity. The results of the fuel ethanol LCI demonstrate that even though alcohol is considered a renewable fuel because it comes from biomass (sugarcane), it uses a high quantity and diversity of nonrenewable resources over its lifecycle. The input of renewable resources is also high mainly because of the water consumption in the industrial phases, due to the sugarcane washing process. During the lifecycle of alcohol, there is a surplus of electric energy due to the cogeneration activity. Another focus point is the quantity of emissions to the atmosphere and the diversity of the substances emitted. Harvesting is the unit process that contributes most to global warming. For photochemical ozone formation, harvesting is also the activity with the strongest contributions due to the burning in harvesting and the emissions from using diesel fuel. The acidification impact potential is mostly due to the NOx emitted by the combustion of ethanol during use, on account of the sulfuric acid use in the industrial process and because of the NOx emitted by the burning in harvesting. The main consequence of the intensive use of fertilizers to the field is the high nutrient enrichment impact potential associated with this activity. The main contributions to the ecotoxicity impact potential come from chemical applications during crop growth. The activity that presents the highest impact potential for human toxicity (HT) via air and via soil is harvesting. Via water, HT potential is high in harvesting due to lubricant use on the machines. The normalization results indicate that nutrient enrichment, acidification, and human toxicity via air and via water are the most significant impact potentials for the lifecycle of fuel ethanol. The fuel ethanol lifecycle contributes negatively to all the impact potentials analyzed: global warming, ozone formation, acidification, nutrient enrichment, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity. Concerning energy consumption, it consumes less energy than its own production largely because of the electricity cogeneration system, but this process is highly dependent on water. The main causes for the biggest impact potential indicated by the normalization is the nutrient application, the burning in harvesting and the use of diesel fuel. The recommendations for the ethanol lifecycle are: harvesting the sugarcane without burning; more environmentally benign agricultural practices; renewable fuel rather than diesel; not washing sugarcane and implementing water recycling systems during the industrial processing; and improving the system of gases emissions control during the use of ethanol in cars, mainly for NOx. Other studies on the fuel ethanol from sugarcane may analyze in more details the social aspects, the biodiversity, and the land use impact.",0
"Since the publication of the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007, the securitization of global warming has reached a new level. Numerous public statements and a growing research literature have discussed the potential security risks and conflicts associated with climate change. This article provides an overview of this debate and introduces an assessment framework of climate stress, human security and societal impacts. Key fields of conflict will be addressed, including water stress, land use and food security, natural disasters and environmental migration. A few regional hot spots of climate security will be discussed, such as land-use conflicts in Northern Africa; floods, sea-level rise and human security in Southern Asia; glacier melting and water insecurity in Central Asia and Latin America; water conflicts in the Middle East; climate security in the Mediterranean; and the potential impact on rich countries. Finally, concepts and strategies will be considered to minimize the security risks and move from conflict to cooperation in climate policy.",0
"Several halocarbons having very high global warming or ozone depletion potentials have been used as a blowing agent (BA) for insulation foam in home appliances, such as refrigerators and freezers. Many appliances are shredded after the end of their useful life. Release experiments carried out in the laboratory on insulation foam blown with the blowing agents CFC-11, HCFC-141b, HCF-134fa, and HFC-245fa revealed that not all blowing agents are released during a 6-week period following the shredding process. The experiments confirmed the hypothesis that the release could be divided into three segments: By shredding foam panels, a proportion of the closed cells is either split or damaged to a degree allowing for a sudden release of the contained atmosphere in the cell (the instantaneous release). Cells adjacent to the cut surface may be only slightly damaged by tiny cracks or holes allowing a relative slow release of the BA to the surroundings (the short-term release). A significant portion of the cells in the foam particle will be unaffected and only allows release governed by slow diffusion through the PUR cell wall (the long-term release). The magnitude of the releases is for all three types highly dependent on how fine the foam is shredded. The residual blowing agent remaining after the 6-week period may be very slowly released if the integrity of the foam particles with respect to diffusion properties is kept after disposal of the foam waste on landfills. It is shown by setting up a national model simulating the BA releases following decommissioning of used domestic refrigerators/freezers in the United States that the release patterns are highly dependent on how the appliances are shredded.",0
"one way animals can counter the effects of climatic extremes is via physiological acclimation, but acclimating to one extreme might decrease performance under different conditions. Here, we use field releases of Drosophila melanogaster on two continents across a range of temperatures to test for costs and benefits of developmental or adult cold acclimation. Both types of cold acclimation had enormous benefits at low temperatures in the field; in the coldest releases only cold-acclimated flies were able to find a resource. However, this advantage came at a huge cost; flies that had not been cold-acclimated were up to 36 times more likely to find food than the cold-acclimated flies when temperatures were warm. Such costs and strong benefits were not evident in laboratory tests where we found no reduction in heat survival of the cold-acclimated flies. Field release studies, therefore, reveal costs of cold acclimation that standard laboratory assays do not detect. Thus, although physiological acclimation may dramatically improve fitness over a narrow set of thermal conditions, it may have the opposite effect once conditions extend outside this range, an increasingly likely scenario as temperature variability increases under global climate change.",0
"Trifolium repens (white clover) stolons were inoculated with Ditylenchus dipsaci (stem nematode), and the development of resulting infestations was monitored. Nematodes initially remained confined to superficial locations, concentrating in petiole axils near inoculation points. They were able to migrate slowly from the initial inoculation points and infest adjacent axils, especially in regions near the stolen tip. As time progressed, in some axils, nematodes migrated through the stolen epidermis and colonized slowly expanding subepidermal pockets of host tissue (ca, 0.2-mm length of stolon/day). In these loci nematodes established exponentially increasing populations, but the rates of locus expansion remained constant, indicating that locus expansion was limited by unidentified host-dependent factors. As a result of increasing population pressure within subepidermal loci, J4 entered a ''diapause'' state and the rate of egg production by adults declined, thereby reducing rate of population growth to more sustainable levels. Typically, these populations peaked at ca. 10,000 individuals in ca. 160 days occupying S-cm lengths of stolen. Thereafter, heavily infested regions of stolons started to die, leading to the formation of longitudinal splits in their epidermis. In other axils, nematodes did not migrate into the stolons but remained confined to axils. Some of these populations increased a hundred-fold in 95 days, with population growth ending when petioles started to die. Host plant stolen morphology was affected only when subepidermal stolen populations developed high population levels (>100 nematodes) within close proximity (<2 cm) to active terminal meristems. This occurred either when axillary buds became active on previously infested nodes or when nematodes established endoparasitic populations at locations near the stolen tip during winter and spring, when the rate of stolen extension was limited by low light intensity. Affected stolen tips could ''escape'' from the influence of such infestations when light intensity and temperature increased. Nematode activity was limited by low temperature rather than light intensity. Global warming is likely to lead to greater damage to infested plants during the winter and early spring because the predicted milder winter temperatures will enhance nematode activity but not necessarily promote stolen growth.",0
"It is only recently that freshwaters have been identified as important quantitative components of the carbon (C) cycle at global and regional scales. To date there are no studies that quantitatively predict the effects of alterations in temperature and flow regimes, individually, or in concert, on organic C dynamics in streams. To address this need, we applied a mechanistic model to simulate organic C dynamics in Mediterranean river networks under 27 different scenarios of altered temperature and flow regimes. We predict that the organic C dynamics in freshwaters in the Mediterranean, as well as in other semiarid regions, will be highly sensitive to global climate change owing to major increases in the degree of intermittency as well as in flood frequency and magnitude. Results indicate that flow regime alterations increase C export rates, whereas temperature alterations increase instream metabolism of organic C. However, flow regime alterations exhibit a much greater influence on C dynamics than do changes in the temperature regime. Reservoirs partly counteract the effects of flow extremes on C export rates, and their role in the C dynamics increases with increasing flow variability. The present study is one of the first studies to quantify the complex interactions between the flow and the temperature regime on C dynamics, emphasizing the key role of extreme events such as dry periods and floods, compared with overall trend effects. This information is pivotal in understanding the impact of future climate change on global C dynamics.",0
" We present the longest data set of observed soil moisture available in the world, 45 yr of gravimetrically-observed plant available soil moisture for the top 1 m of soil, observed every 10 days for April-October for 141 stations from fields with either winter or spring cereals from the Ukraine for 1958-2002. We averaged the summer observations over the entire region to account for the observed scale of soil moisture variations, to enhance the portion of the variance that is related to meteorological forcing. The observations show a positive soil moisture trend for the entire period of observation, with the trend leveling off in the last two decades. Although models of global warming predict summer desiccation in a greenhouse-warmed world, there is no evidence for this in the observations yet, even though the region has been warming for the entire period. While the interannual variations of soil moisture simulated by both the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Prediction and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalyses are close to the observations, neither reanalysis simulates the observed upward trend. Climate model simulations for the period show the same general shape as the observations, but differ quite a bit from each other and from the observations. An observed downward trend in insolation may have produced a downward trend in evaporation and may have contributed to the upward soil moisture trend.",0
"We describe a scenario of climate forcing on sedimentation recorded in the late Paleocene-early Eocene Cicogna marine section from the Belluno Basin ( NE Italy). Previously published magneto-biostratigraphic data revealed that the similar to 81 m Cicogna section extends from Chron C25r to Chron C23r spanning the NP7/NP8-NP12 nannofossil zones (similar to 52.2-56.6 Ma). Using previously published rock magnetic data, augmented by data from this study, we describe and thoroughly discuss a pronounced increase of hematite ( relative to maghemite or magnetite) between similar to 54.9 and 54.6 Ma immediately above the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, followed by a second, long-term increasing trend from similar to 54 Ma up to similar to 52.2 Ma in the early Eocene. This hematite is essentially of detrital origin, insofar as it is associated with a strong shallow bias of paleomagnetic inclinations, and is interpreted to have formed on land by the weathering of Fe-bearing silicates and other primary minerals. We speculate that the warm and humid climate typical of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM, similar to 54.9 Ma) as well as of the warming trend leading to the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO; similar to 52-50 Ma) enhanced continental weathering of silicate rocks with the consequent production, transport, and sedimentation of detrital hematite grains. This hypothesis is confirmed by a statistical correlation between the rock magnetic properties and global climate as revealed by a standard benthic oxygen isotope record from the literature. Our temporal coupling between oxidation state of sedimentary magnetic phases and global climate is therefore consistent with the existence in the Paleocene-Eocene of the silicate weathering negative feedback mechanism for the long-term stabilization of the Earth's surface temperature.",1
"Global warming is one of the most serious problems which human beings are currently facing. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants is considered one of the major causes of global warming. In the present study, CO2 emissions from tokamak fusion power plants are compared with those from present power generating technologies. Plasma parameters are calculated by a systems code that couples the ITER physics, toroidal field coil shape and cost calculation. CO2 emissions from construction and operation are evaluated by multiplying component volume by the CO2 emission intensities of the component materials. The reactor building, balance of plant, etc., are scaled from the ITER reference power reactor ('ITER-like') by use of the Generomak model. The most important finding is that CO2 emissions from fusion reactors are less than those from photovoltaic systems and less than double those from fission reactors. The other findings are that: (i) Most CO2 emissions from fusion reactors are from materials. (ii) CO2 emissions from reactor construction account for almost 60-70% of the total, with the rest coming from reactor operation. (iii) The reversed shear reactor can reduce CO2 emissions by half compared with the ITER-like reactor. It is concluded that tokamak fusion reactors are excellent for their low CO2 emission intensity, and that they can be one of the effective energy supply technologies to solve global warming.",1
"The environmental impact of refrigeration systems can be reduced by operation at higher efficiency and reduction of refrigerant leakage. Refrigerant loss contributes both directly and indirectly to global warming through inefficient system operation, increased power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and higher maintenance costs. Existing sensor-based leak detection methods are limited by the inability to detect gradual leakage and the need for careful sensor location. There is a requirement for a real-time performance monitoring approach to leak detection and fault diagnosis which overcomes these disadvantages. This paper reports on the development of a fault diagnosis and refrigerant leak detection system based on artificial intelligence and real-time performance monitoring. The system has been used successfully to distinguish between faulty and fault free operation, steady-state and transient operation, leakage and over charge conditions. Work currently underway is aimed at testing additional fault conditions and establishing further rules to distinguish between these patterns. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.",1
"The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been promoting research and development on the hydrogen production technology with a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), with a view to contributing to the global warming issue and hydrogen energy society in the near future. The system integration technology for connection of the hydrogen production system to the HTGR is one of the key technologies to put hydrogen production with nuclear energy to commercial use. Research and development on the system integration technology has been carried out for four items: control technology to maintain reactor operation against thermal disturbance caused by the hydrogen production system, estimation of the tritium permeation into the hydrogen from the reactor, a countermeasure against explosion, and development of a high-temperature valve to isolate the reactor and hydrogen production systems in accidents. This report describes the research activities on the system integration technology at JAEA.",1
"Optimizing a three-way pact comprising crop yields, fertility inputs and greenhouse gases may minimize the contribution of croplands to global warming. Fluxes of N(2)O, CO(2) and CH(4) from soil were measured under maize (Zea mays L.) grown using 0, 60 and 120 kg N hm(-2) as NH(4)NO(3)-N and composted manure-N in three seasons on clay (Chromic luvisol) and sandy loam (Haplic lixisol) soils in Zimbabwe. The fluxes were measured using the static chamber methodology involving gas chromatography for ample air analysis. Over an average of 122 days we estimated emissions of 0.1 to 0.5 kg N(2)O-N hm(-2), 711 to 1574 kg CO(2)-C hm(-2) and-2.6 to 5.8 kg CH(4)-C hm(-2) from six treatments during season II with the highest fluxes. The posed hypothesis that composted manure-N may be better placed as a mitigation option against soil emissions of GHG than mineral fertilizer-N was largely supported by N(2)O fluxes during the wet period of the year, but with high level of uncertainty. Nitrogen addition might have stimulated both emissions and consumption of CH(4) but the sink or source strength depended highly on soil water content. We concluded that the application of mineral-N and manure input may play an important role with reference to global warming provided the season can support substantial crop productivity that may reduce the amount of N(2)O loss per unit yield. Confidence in fluxes response to agricultural management is still low due to sporadic measurements and limited observations from the southern African region.",1
"Without exception, global warming affects the water resources in Korea. Several climate change projects have been initiated for future water resources assessment but have produced very different projections with a significant range of heterogeneities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a standard procedure and scheme that can reduce this heterogeneity. In this study, we first examine all general circulation model (GCM) scenarios available at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre. The six A1B GCM scenarios are then selected (such as INM, CCCma, MPI_MIUB, UKMO, NIES and NCAR) for a climate change assessment of water resources in Korea. A modified version of a reliability ensemble average (M-REA) has been proposed as a multi-model ensemble weighting scheme that can combine the heterogeneous scenarios. When applied to the six A1B GCM scenarios, M-REA projected that Korea on an average will experience a 9.43% increase in precipitation in the year 2037.",1
"Sequestering C in agricultural soils presents an immediate viable option to reduce atmospheric CO2 to help mitigate global warming. Agricultural land managers who adopt practices that sequester C might market the sequestered (i.e., stored) C as a C credit to industrial CO2 emitters who wish to reduce their net CO2 emissions. Land managers or landowners will need to verify changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) related to a change in management practice to facilitate C credit trading. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of Century model predictions of SOC change due to the adoption of no-tillage using site-specific data and data from existing soil databases. We hypothesized that (i) using site-specific soil data would result in the most accurate Century estimates and (ii) Century estimates are sensitive to soil clay percentage. Five paired tillage/no-tillage farm sites in north-central Montana were used to test model predictions. Sites were chosen such that soil, landscape, climatic conditions, and historical cropping systems were similar within each tillage/ no-tillage pair. The Century model overestimated SOC content using site-specific soils data by an average of 10%. Century was sensitive to the effects of clay content when predicting the total amount of SOC in a particular field. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that a linear association exists between clay content and Century-estimated C change due to no-tillage. Results suggest that (i) the effect of clay percentage on the rate of C change is not well understood and (ii) the Century model is an acceptable predictor of soil C for C trading. Further examination of the relationship between soil clay content and the rate of C storage in agricultural systems is needed to determine if adjustments to the Century model are required.",1
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) constituted by the World Meteorological Organisation provides expert guidance regarding scientific and technical aspects of the climate problem. Since 1990 IPCC has, at five-yearly intervals, assessed and reported on the current state of knowledge and understanding of the climate issue. These reports have projected the behaviour of the Asian monsoon in the warming world. While the IPCC Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996) on climate model projections of Asian/Indian monsoon stated ""Most climate models produce more rainfall over South Asia in a warmer climate with increasing CO2"", the recent IPCC (2001) Third Assessment Report states ""It is likely that the warming associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will cause an increase in Asian summer monsoon variability and changes in monsoon strength."" Climate model projections (IPCC, 2001) also suggest more El Nino-like events in the tropical Pacific, increase in surface temperatures and decrease in the northern hemisphere snow cover. The Indian Monsoon is an important component of the Asian monsoon and its links with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, northern hemisphere surface temperature and Eurasian snow are well documented. In the light of the IPCC global warming projections on the Asian monsoon, the interannual and decadal variability in summer monsoon rainfall over India and its teleconnections have been examined by using observed data for the 131-year (1871-2001) period. While the interannual variations show year-to-year random fluctuations, the decadal variations reveal distinct alternate epochs of above and below normal rainfall. The epochs tend to last for about three decades. There is no clear evidence to suggest that the strength and variability of the Indian Monsoon Rainfall (IMR) nor the epochal changes are affected by the global warming. Though the 1990s have been the warmest decade of the millennium (IPCC, 2001), the IMR variability has decreased drastically. Connections between the ENSO phenomenon, Northern Hemisphere surface temperature and the Eurasian snow with IMR reveal that the correlations are not only weak but have changed signs in the early 1990s suggesting that the IMR has delinked not only with the Pacific but with the Northern Hemisphere/Eurasian continent also. The fact that temperature/snow relationships with IMR are weak further suggests that global warming need not be a cause for the recent ENSO-Monsoon weakening. Observed snow depth over the Eurasian continent has been increasing, which could be a result of enhanced precipitation due to the global warming.",1
"Ecophysiological models are widely used to forecast potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity and to examine options for adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers. However, protocols followed in such assessments vary to such an extent that they constrain cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed papers that used crop simulation models to examine diverse aspects of how climate change might affect agricultural systems. Six subject areas were examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s) used and their characteristics; sources and application of data on [CO(2)] and climate; impact parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize, soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170 papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers) were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent approach used to simulate response to CO(2) involved adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and transpiration, precluding consideration of the interacting effects of CO(2), stomatal conductance and canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [CO(2)] typically corresponded to conditions 10-30 years earlier than the date the paper was accepted, exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [CO(2)]. Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [CO(2)] also varied greatly. further complicating comparisons among studies. Papers considering adaptation predominantly examined changes in planting dates and cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in over half the papers, mainly in relation to variability in yield or effects of water deficits, but the limited consideration of other factors affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests that impacts of climate change were overestimated relative to background variability. A coordinated crop, climate and soil data resource would allow researchers to focus on underlying science. More extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by modular software, should strengthen the biological realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate change on crop production and associated food security as well as to evaluate potential for adaptation.

"Time sclice experiments are performed with the atmospheric GCM ARPEGE, developed at Meteo-France, to study the impact to increases in the atmospheric carbon dioxide. This spectral model runs at T42 horizontal resolution with 30 vertical layers including a comprehensive tropospheric and stratospheric resolution and a prognostic parameterization of the ozone mixing ratio. The model is forced in a 5-year control run by climatological SSTs and sea-ice extents in order to obtain an accurate simulation of the present-day climate. Two perturbed runs are performed using SSTs and sea-ice extents for doubled CO2 concentration, obtained from transient runs performed by two coupled atmospheric-oceanic models run at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) in Hamburg and the Hadley Centre (HC). A global surface temperature warming of 6 K is obtained with the MPI SST anomalies and 9 K with the HC SST anomalies. The precipitation rate increases by 4.2% (and 4.7%). The features obtained in the stratosphere (a cooling increasing with the altitude and an increase in the ozone mixing ratio) are not sensitive to the oceanic forcing. On the contrary, the ano malies in the troposphere such as a warming increasing with altitude, an acceleration of westerly jets and a raised cloud height, depend on the oceanic forcing imposed in the two perturbed runs. Special attention is given to continental areas where the impact of the oceanic forcing is studied over eight regions around the globe. Regions sensitive to oceanic forcing such as Europe are identified in contrast with areas where the patterns are driven by land-surface physical processes, such as over continental Asia. Finally, the Koppen classification is applied to the climate simulated in the three experiments. Both doubled CO2 runs show the same predominance of global warming over precipitation changes in the Koppen analyses.",1
"As the volume of CO2 one of greenhouse gases linked to global warming, in the atmosphere increases, there has been an increasing interest in CO2 sequestration. Aqueous carbonation, which involves the extraction of Mg from serpentine minerals and the subsequent carbonation reaction with CO2 to forin the geologically stable mineral MgCO3, has been proposed as a promising CO, sequestration technology. This study investigates the dissolution of Mg from serpentine mineral in H2SO4 solution. The study is part of a major research project aimed at developing an effective CO2 sequestration technology using the serpentine mineral which is readily available in Korea. Complete dissolution of Mg from natural serpentine was achieved in 30 min at a temperature of 90 degrees C under 0.5 M H2SO4. The rate of dissolution of Mg was independent of the agitation speed at speeds above 300 rpm. The fraction of Mg dissolved from milled serpentine was found to be a little higher than that from natural serpentine up to 70 degrees C in 0.5 M H2SO4. The Jander equation was used to explain the dissolution rate data. The rate of Mg dissolution seemed to be limited by diffusion through the thin channels formed between the silica layers in the serpentine particles. [doi:10.2320/matertrans.M2009019]",1
"To limit mean global warming to 2 C, a goal supported by more than 100 countries, it will likely be necessary to reduce emissions not only of greenhouse gases but also of air pollutants with high radiative forcing (RF), particularly black carbon (BC). Although several recent research papers have attempted to quantify the effects of BC on climate, not all these analyses have incorporated all the mechanisms that contribute to its RF (including the effects of BC on cloud albedo, cloud coverage, and snow and ice albedo, and the optical consequences of aerosol mixing) and have reported their results in different units and with different ranges of uncertainty. Here we attempt to reconcile their results and present them in uniform units that include the same forcing factors. We use the best estimate of effective RF obtained from these results to analyze the benefits of mitigating BC emissions for achieving a specific equilibrium temperature target. For a 500 ppm CO(2)e (3.1 Wm(-2)) effective RF target in 2100, which would offer about a 50% chance of limiting equilibrium warming to 2.5 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures, we estimate that failing to reduce carbonaceous aerosol emissions from contained combustion would require CO2 emission cuts about 8 years (range of 1-15 years) earlier than would be necessary with full mitigation of these emissions.",1
"The response of marine and terrestrial environments to global changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations will likely be governed by both responses to direct environmental forcing and responses to Earth-system feedbacks induced by that forcing. it has been proposed that anthropogenic greenhouse forcing will intensify coastal upwelling in eastern boundary current regions [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247, 198-201]. Focusing on the California Current, we show that biophysical land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks induced by CO2 radiative forcing enhance the radiative effects Of CO2 on land-sea thermal contrast, resulting in changes in eastern boundary current total seasonal upwelling and upwelling seasonality. Specifically, relative to CO2 radiative forcing, land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks lead to a stronger increase in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the northern limb of the California Current and a stronger decrease in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the southern limb. Such changes will impact both marine and terrestrial communities [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247,198-201; Soto, C. G. (2001) Rev. Fish Biol. Fish. 11, 181-195; and Agostini, V. N. & Bakun, A. (2002) Fish. Oceanogr. 11, 129-142], and these and other Earth-system feedbacks should be expected to play a substantial role in shaping the response of eastern boundary current regions to CO2 radiative forcing.",1
"Goal, Scope and Background. The life cycles of many products including textiles contain chemicals for which process flow data are not known or are too time consuming to collect. Although each chemical may not contribute significantly to the LCA results of the product, which might justify excluding them, but together their contribution could be significant. Similarly, rough estimates of the process flows for the production of a single chemical may be very uncertain and considered meaningless, while the estimates of the cumulative data of process flows for several chemicals may be less uncertain and be a meaningful contribution to the quality of the LCA results. There are methods for estimation of process flows for different types of products, with varying demands regarding input data and time and with varying accuracy of the results. This work contributes to the available methods, focusing on simple estimations for production of chemical substances. The goal was to create a fast method for estimation of emissions, resource and energy flows (process flows) for the production of chemicals, based on easily available data on the properties of the chemicals. The process flows investigated were limited to those normally associated with process industries and contributing most to depletion of resources, to global warming, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical ozone production, i.e. use of energy, crude oil, coal, natural gas, uranium in ore and emissions of CO2, So(x), NOx, NMVOC, methane, BOD, COD and total N: Toxic substances were excluded, since toxic emissions are substance specific and cannot be included in a generalization. Method. Available data for the process flows for the production of chemicals of mainly fossil origin were correlated to properties of chemicals such as amount of carbon in the molecule, heat of formation and average number of chemical reaction steps in the production. The production procedures were found in readily available literature. Up to about six reaction steps were evaluated in the correlation study. The variations in the process flows among the chemicals studied were calculated. Results and Discussion. There were weak correlations between average number of chemical reaction steps in the production and energy use, COD measured in water emissions, and Sox and NO, emissions to air. For the remaining properties of chemicals and process flows, there were only weak correlations for share of double bonding in the molecule if only molecules containing double bondings were included. Conclusions. The precision in estimation of the process flows increases non-significantly when adding information on the number of reaction steps or share of double bonding for chemicals containing double bonding is added. Recommendations and Outlook. It seems reasonable to start with a simple grouping method to estimate the process flows for the production of a chemical of fossil origin. Further investigations might investigate whether there is a correlation between process flows and the costs of chemicals, and further study the correlations between process flows and share of double bonding for chemicals containing double bondings.",1
"Hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) are being used as third generation replacements to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) because of their nearly zero stratospheric ozone depletion and relatively low global warming potential. HFEs have been developed under commercial uses as cleaning solvents (incl., HFE-7500, C7F15OC2H5; HFE-7200, C4F9OC2H5; HFE-7100, C4F9CH3; HFE-7000, n-C3F7OCH3) blowing agents (incl., HFE-245mc, CF3CF2OCH3; HFC-356mec, CF3CHFCF2OCH3) refrigerants (incl., HFE-143a, CF3OCH3; HFE-134, CHF2OCHF2; HFE-245mc, CF3CF2OCH3) and dry etching agents in semiconductor manufacturing, (incl., HFE-227me, CF3OCHFCF3) From the environmental, ecological, and health points of view, it is important to understand their environmental risks for these HFEs from a diversity of commercial applications and industrial processes. This paper aims to introduce these HFEs with respect to physiochemical properties, commercial uses, and environmental hazards (i.e. global warming, photochemical potential, fire and explosion hazard, and environmental partition). Further, it addresses the updated data on the human toxicity, occupational exposure and potential health risk of commercial HFEs. It is concluded that there are few HFEs that still possess some environmental hazards, including global warming, flammability hazard and adverse effect of exposure. The partition coefficient for these HFEs has been estimated using the group contribution method; the values of log K-ow for commercial HFEs have been estimated to be below 3.5. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

"Nowadays, energetic needs are mainly covered by fossil energies leading to pollutant emissions mostly responsible for global warming. Among the different possible solutions for the greenhouse effect reduction, hydrogen has been proposed for energy transportation. Indeed, H-2 can be seen as a clean and efficient energy carrier. However, beside the difficulties related to hydrogen production, efficient high capacity storage is still to be developed. Hydrogen can be stored as a compressed gas, in liquefied tanks or absorbed in solids. Many metals and alloys are able to store large amounts of hydrogen. This latter solution is of interest in terms of safety, global yield and long time storage. However, to be suitable for applications, such compounds must present high capacity, good reversibility, fast reactivity and sustainability. In this paper, we will review on the structural and thermodynamic properties of metallic hydrides. Their solid-gas hydrogenation behaviour and the related absorption-desorption isotherm curves are examined as a useful criterion for the selection of suitable materials for applications. The storage performances obtained with these alloys are reported and some solutions to common problems such as corrosion, passivation, decrepitation, poor kinetic and short cycle life are discussed.

"The environmental burden of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules is currently largely determined by the cumulative input of fossil energy used for module production. However, with an increased focus on limiting the emission of CO(2) coming from fossil fuels, it is expected that renewable resources, including photovoltaics, may well become more important in producing electricity. A comparison of the environmental impacts of PV modules in case their life cycle is based on the use of PV electricity in contrast to conventional electricity can elucidate potential environmental drawbacks in an early stage of development of a solar-based economy. The goal of this paper is to show for ten impact categories the environmental consequences of replacing fossil electricity with solar electricity into the life cycle of two types of PV modules. Using life cycle assessment (LCA), we evaluated the environmental impacts of two types of PV modules: a thin-film GaInP/GaAs tandem module and a multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) module. For each of the modules, the total amount of fossil electricity required in the life cycle of the module was substituted with electricity that is generated by a corresponding PV module. The environmental impacts of the modules on the midpoint level were compared with those of the same modules in case their life cycle is based on the use of conventional electricity. The environmental impacts were assessed for Western European circumstances with an annual solar irradiation of 1000 kWh/m(2). For the GaInP/GaAs module, the environmental impacts of individual production steps were also analysed. Environmental burdens decreased when PV electricity was applied in the life cycle of the two PV modules. The impact score reductions of the GaInP/GaAs module were up to a factor of 4.9 (global warming). The impact score reductions found for the multi-Si module were up to a factor of 2.5 (abiotic depletion and global warming). Reductions of the toxicity scores of both module types were smaller or negligible. This is caused by a decreased use of fossil fuels, on the one hand, and an increased consumption of materials for the production of the additional solar modules used for generating the required PV electricity on the other. Overall, the impact scores of the GaInP/GaAs module were reduced more than the corresponding scores of the multi-Si module. The contribution analysis of the GaInP/GaAs module production steps indicated that for global warming, the cell growth process is dominant for supply with conventional electricity, while for the solar scenario, the frame becomes dominant. Regarding freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity scores associated with the life cycle of the GaInP/GaAs module, the cell growth process is dominant for supply with conventional electricity, while the reactor system for the cell growth with the associated gas scrubbing system is dominant for the solar scenario. There are uncertainties regarding the calculated environmental impact scores. This paper describes uncertainties associated with the used economic allocation method, and uncertainties because of missing life cycle inventory data. For the GaInP/GaAs module, it was found that the global warming impact scores range from -66% to +41%, and the freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity scores (for an infinite time horizon) range from -40% to +300% compared to the default estimates. For both impact categories, the choices associated with the allocation of gallium, with the electricity mix, with the conversion efficiency of the commercially produced GaInP/GaAs cells, and with the yield of the cell growth process are most influential. For freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, the uncertainty concerning the lifetime of the reactor system for the GaInP/GaAs cell growth process and the gas scrubbing system is particularly relevant. Use of PV electricity instead of fossil electricity significantly reduces the environmental burdens of the GaInP/GaAs and the multi-Si module. The reductions of the toxicity scores, however, are smaller or negligible. Toxicity impacts of the GaInP/GaAs cells can be reduced by improvement of the yield of the cell growth process, a reduced energy demand in the cell growth process, reduction of the amount of stainless steel in the cell growth reactor system and the gas scrubbing system, and a longer lifetime of these systems. Because the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of fossil-fuel-based electricity have an important share in global warming on a world-wide scale, switching to a more extensive use of solar power is helpful to comply with the present international legislation on the area of global warming reduction. As reductions in toxicity impact scores are smaller or negligible when fossil electricity is replaced by PV electricity, it is desirable to give specific attention to the processes which dominantly contribute to these impact categories. Furthermore, in this study, a shift in ranking of several environmental impacts of the modules has been found when PV electricity is used instead of fossil electricity. The results of a comparative LCA can thus be dependent of the electricity mix used in the life cycles of the assessed products.",1
"This study investigates the effect of global warming on drought patterns over Asia at the end of the twenty-first century by a multi-model ensemble method based on daily precipitation data of 15 coupled climate models simulations under SRES A1B scenario, thereby assessing the consistency of responses among different models. The projected precipitation climatology was translated into the change in drought climatology using the effective drought index. The results of the models were consistent in that they project an increase in the mean and the standard deviation of precipitation over most of Asia, and the increase was considerably greater in higher latitude areas. Therefore, it is expected that in future, drought over most of Asia will occur less frequently with weaker intensity and shorter duration than those prevalent currently. However, two special regions were detected. One was the Asian monsoon regions (AMRs: South Asia and East Asia), which showed a greater increase in the standard deviation of precipitation than the mean precipitation, with an amplified seasonal precipitation cycle. As a result, part of the AMRs exhibited slight increases in drought properties such as frequency and intensity. The other region was West Asia. The region showed decreased mean precipitation, especially in its northern part (Syria and its vicinity), and more frequent droughts were projected for this region with enhanced drought intensity and lengthened drought duration. The worsening trends in drought patterns over both regions were more significant in extreme drought, the likelihood of which is relatively higher in summer in West Asia and from spring to summer in the AMRs.",1
"In developing an optimization framework to assist in the design process of biofuel systems, the economic effectiveness of the supply network should not be adopted as the sole criterion to focus on. In fact, there has recently been growing attention in including environmental concerns at the strategic level of supply chain management. In this part 2, the spatially explicit multi-echelon mixed integer linear program (MILP) modeling framework described in part 1(1) of this work has been extended by including environmental issues along with the traditional economic ones within a more comprehensive multi-objective optimization tool. The economics have been assessed by means of supply chain analysis techniques, focusing on biomass cultivation site locations, ethanol production capacity assignment and facilities location,. as well as transport system optimization. The environmental performance of the system has been evaluated in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, by adopting a well-to-tank (WTT) approach to consider the supply network operating impact on global warming over the entire life cycle. The strategic design tool as developed has been applied and solved in assessing the emerging corn-based Italian ethanol system. The resulting outcomes demonstrate the valuable support that the model may provide in formulating a well-advised strategic policy to promote the market penetration as well as to reduce the social and environmental impacts of biomass-based fuels.",1
"By the end of this century, anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are expected to decrease the surface ocean pH by as much as 0.3 unit. At the same time, the ocean is expected to warm with an associated expansion of the oxygen minimum layer (OML). Thus, there is a growing demand to understand the response of the marine biota to these global changes. We show that ocean acidification will substantially depress metabolic rates (31%) and activity levels (45%) in the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas, a top predator in the Eastern Pacific. This effect is exacerbated by high temperature. Reduced aerobic and locomotory scope in warm, high-CO2 surface waters will presumably impair predator-prey interactions with cascading consequences for growth, reproduction, and survival. Moreover, as the OML shoals, squids will have to retreat to these shallower, less hospitable, waters at night to feed and repay any oxygen debt that accumulates during their diel vertical migration into the OML. Thus, we demonstrate that, in the absence of adaptation or horizontal migration, the synergism between ocean acidification, global warming, and expanding hypoxia will compress the habitable depth range of the species. These interactions may ultimately define the long-term fate of this commercially and ecologically important predator.",1
"There is a profound debate over how to assign greenhouse gas (GHG) responsibilities; therefore, we have decided to follow IPCC guidelines, as they offer the only standardized method. We have identified each type of greenhouse emission and its level of absorption. We have studied the province and its districts and municipalities. We have determined that the energy sector is that with the highest level of emissions, even if the per capita emissions of the Province of Siena are very low. This is caused by a very low level of industrialization and the presence of a local geothermal production of energy. In order to highlight this aspect, we have considered scenarios both with and without geothermal production. Our research was then focused on single districts (groups of homogenous municipalities) and municipalities, where we found great differences among the greenhouse emissions of the areas. We have constructed a map of the greenhouse emissions of the whole province. It has been interesting to note that there are 14 municipalities with net negative emissions, seven with low positive emissions, 12 with medium positive emissions and three with elevated positive emissions. These latter correspond to the main city and to two of the most industrialized municipalities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Industrial development has lead to higher energy consumption, emission of greenhouse gases, as well as air pollutants. Cement factories play an important role in over all greenhouse emissions. This study aims to investigate the role of Iranian cement industries and their contribution of greenhouse gases contribution. The measured emission factors for oil and fuel gas shows that carbon dioxide contribution from fuel oil based cement industries is almost 2.7 times higher than gas based cement factories. The strength, weakness, opportunity and threat technique analysis showed that the best strategy to combat greenhouse gases from Iranian cement factory is to implement energy efficiency measures. Further, strategic position and action evaluation matrix analysis indicates that Iranian cement industries fall within invasive category. Therefore, exploitation of opportunities must carefully be used. One of these opportunities is the utilization of financial assistance provided by clean development mechanism. The results show that replacement of ball mills with vertical roller mill can reduce the electricity consumption from 44.6 to 28 kWh/ton. As a result of such substitution about 720 million kWh/y of electricity would be saved (almost a power plant of 125 MW capacities). Though implementation of new mills may not be economic for the cement industries' owner, but the overall gain for the government of Iran will be about US$ 304 million. If the duration of such efficiency measure is considered as about 12 y, then the overall CO(2) reduction/phase-out would be around 4.3 million tons.",1
"The transport sector emits a wide variety of gases and aerosols, with distinctly different characteristics which influence climate directly and indirectly via chemical and physical processes. Tools that allow these emissions to be placed on some kind of common scale in terms of their impact on climate have a number of possible uses such as: in agreements and emission trading schemes; when considering potential trade-offs between changes in emissions resulting from technological or operational developments; and/or for comparing the impact of different environmental impacts of transport activities. Many of the non-CO2 emissions from the transport sector are short-lived substances, not currently covered by the Kyoto Protocol. There are formidable difficulties in developing metrics and these are particularly acute for such short-lived species. One difficulty concerns the choice of an appropriate structure for the metric (which may depend on, for example, the design of any climate policy it is intended to serve) and the associated value judgements on the appropriate time periods to consider; these choices affect the perception of the relative importance of short- and long-lived species. A second difficulty is the quantification of input parameters (due to underlying uncertainty in atmospheric processes). In addition, for some transport-related emissions, the values of metrics (unlike the gases included in the Kyoto Protocol) depend on where and when the emissions are introduced into the atmosphere - both the regional distribution and, for aircraft, the distribution as a function of altitude, are important. In this assessment of such metrics, we present Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) as these have traditionally been used in the implementation of climate policy. We also present Global Temperature Change Potentials (GTPs) as an alternative metric, as this, or a similar metric may be more appropriate for use in some circumstances. We use radiative forcings and lifetimes from the literature to derive GWPs and GTPs for the main transport-related emissions, and discuss the uncertainties in these estimates. We find large variations in metric (GWP and GTP) values for NOx, mainly due to the dependence on location of emissions but also because of inter-model differences and differences in experimental design. For aerosols we give only global-mean values due to an inconsistent picture amongst available studies regarding regional dependence. The uncertainty in the presented metric values reflects the current state of understanding; the ranking of the various components with respect to our confidence in the given metric values is also given. While the focus is mostly on metrics for comparing the climate impact of emissions, many of the issues are equally relevant for stratospheric ozone depletion metrics, which are also discussed.

"Simulations of impacts of a double-CO2 climate with the Changed Climate Fire Modeling System in Northern California consistently projected increases in area burned and in the frequency of escaped fires compared with simulations of the present climate. However, the magnitude of those increases was strongly influenced by vegetation type, choice of atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) scenario, and choice of climate forcing variables. The greatest projected increase in fire severity occurred in grasslands, using the Princeton Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCM, with wind speed, temperature, humidity and precipitation as driving variables.",1
"This paper deals with sustainable energy technologies under restrictions on resources and environmental impact. We have developed a database to estimate life-cycle efficiencies and greenhouse gas emissions. Next, we define sustainability limitations on resource depletion and emissions. Based on these concepts, the present world energy system is judged to be unsustainable. Mitigation measures such as disposal of CO2 and solar power generation are evaluated utilizing the concept. We show how sustainability influences the cost-effectiveness of measures taken. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.",1
"The Greenland coastal temperatures have followed the early 20th century global warming trend. Since 1940, however, the Greenland coastal stations data have undergone predominantly a cooling trend. At the summit of the Greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2.2degreesC per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987. This suggests that the Greenland ice sheet and coastal regions are not following the current global warming trend. A considerable and rapid warming over all of coastal Greenland occurred in the 1920s when the average annual surface air temperature rose between 2 and 4 degreesC in less than ten years (at some stations the increase in winter temperature was as high as 6degreesC). This rapid warming, at a time when the change in anthropogenic production of greenhouse gases was well below the current level, suggests a high natural variability in the regional climate. High anticorrelations (r = -0.84 to -0.93) between the NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) index and Greenland temperature time series suggest a physical connection between these processes. Therefore, the future changes in the NAO and Northern Annular Mode may be of critical consequence to the future temperature forcing of the Greenland ice sheet melt rates.",1
"The objective of this work was to simulate rice grain yield in climate change scenarios with increasing of current atmospheric CO2 concentration and increases in mean air temperature in Santa Maria, RS, as well as to verify possible implications on current recommendations of sowing period. Climate change scenarios for the next one hundred years considering doubled CO2 concentration and increases of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 degrees C were used. Rice grain yield was simulated with the InfoCrop model. Simulations were performed considering three rice cultivars - IRGA 421, IRGA 417 and EPAGRI 109 - and seven sowing dates spaced monthly from July 20(th) to January 20(th). An increase in rice grain yield was observed in the climate change scenarios simulated for the three cultivars, with higher increase for the very early cultivar (IRGA 421) and lower increase for the late cultivar (EPAGRI 109). If climate change takes place, currently sowing period recommended for irrigated rice shall be enlarged.",1
"The emissions trading first proposed by the US as a concrete idea is a promising policy framework to tackle the global climate change issue. It not only has its high cost efficiency/flexibility but also has big potential as an instrument which is profitable for both buyers and sellers and (must) enforce(s) the compliance with the emission limitations, in principle. It can be the incentives for economy in transition Parties to choose energy-saving economic development path and also for the developing country Parties to join the regime in the following phases. This paper focuses on its pragmatic aspects and clarifies its merits and problems to be solved in order to probe into its possibilities to be installed. Some related trading scheme on environmental issues are discussed to have implications for the climate change case. For climate change trading scheme, concrete proposals are suggested for the emissions budget approach and borrowing. In addition, an idea - packaging carbon taxation and emissions trading - is proposed for the establishment of the domestic emissions market which guarantees the compliance of the Protocol automatically. These elements and proposals are expected to be useful information to clarify the points for the international negotiations with some concrete images, not general ideas.

"Recently, global warming and its effects have become one of the most important themes in the world. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has agreed to an 8% reduction in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2008-2012. The GHG emissions (total GHG, CO(2), CO, SO(2), NO(2), E (emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds)) covered by the Protocol are weighted by their global warming potentials (GWPs) and aggregated to give total emissions in CO(2) equivalents. The main subject in this study is to obtain equations by the artificial neural network (ANN) approach to predict the GHGs of Turkey using sectoral energy consumption. The equations obtained are used to determine the future level of the GHG and to take measures to control the share of sectors in total emission. According to ANN results, the maximum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was found as 0.147151, 0.066716, 0.181901, 0.105146, 0.124684, and 0.158157 for GHG, SO(2), NO(2), CO, E, and CO(2), respectively, for the training data with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm by 8 neurons. R(2) values are obtained very close to  Also, this study proposes mitigation policies for GHGs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The impacts of global climate change on the water resources of the Nile River Basin were evaluated using simulation models. Four climate change scenarios were evaluated (baseline, GISS, GFDL, and UKMO). The complete impact of climatic changes in the Nile cannot be fully predicted with confidence, as some models forecast increased flows, while others project significant decreases. However, it was observed that the Nile River flow is extremely sensitive to ambient temperature and precipitation changes, and it is possible that the effects of climatic fluctuations would be severe. Several water management options were identified to help adapt Nile River management to a changing global climate.",1
"Boreal winter 2009-2010 made headlines for cold anomalies in many countries of the northern mid-latitudes. Northern Europe was severely hit by this harsh winter in line with a record persistence of the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the present study, we first provide a wider perspective on how unusual this winter was by using the recent 20th Century Reanalysis. A weather regime analysis shows that the frequency of the negative NAO was unprecedented since winter 1939-1940, which is then used as a dynamical analog of winter 2009-2010 to demonstrate that the latter might have been much colder without the background global warming observed during the twentieth century. We then use an original nudging technique in ensembles of global atmospheric simulations driven by observed sea surface temperature (SST) and radiative forcings to highlight the relevance of the stratosphere for understanding if not predicting such anomalous winter seasons. Our results demonstrate that an improved representation of the lower stratosphere is necessary to reproduce not only the seasonal mean negative NAO signal, but also its intraseasonal distribution and the corresponding increased probability of cold waves over northern Europe.

"In this paper, a mathematical model of an oxy-fuel combustion boiler system with flue gas recirculation is investigated. The reduction of CO2 emission from coal-fired power plants is an important research issue in alleviating the global warming. The entire dynamics are decomposed in two main parts; fireside dynamics and water-side dynamics. The fire-side dynamics consist of the mass and energy balance equations in the furnace (combustion process) and the flue gas dynamics represented by the mass balance equations of five gases (O-2, CO2, SO2, H2O and NO2). The water-side dynamics include a drum pressure equation and a steam temperature equation. To validate the developed models, the real experimental data in Karakas. Koumanakos, et al. (2007) are used. To investigate the local behavior near an operating point, a linearization method at its steady-state condition is pursued. The time responses of the entire dynamics using step inputs (the oxygen mass flow rate, the coal mass flow rate, the primary air mass flow rate, etc.) are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"The utility of sewage sludge as a biomass fuel is taken as an approach to deal with global warming. Thermal characterization of this new type of fuel is a premise before it is practically used in real facilities. Four sludge derived fuels were examined by thermal calorimeters (TG-DTA, C80, and TAM) at temperature ramp and isothermal conditions. Heat generation at low temperature was found in some sludge species. The corresponding spontaneous ignition was measured in an adiabatic spontaneous ignition tester at 80 degrees C The reason of the thermal behaviors of the sludge fuels was discussed The critical temperature of large scale pile-up was predicted",1
"Global assessment of the potential impacts of anthropogenically-induced climate change on vector-borne diseases suggests an increase in extent of the geographical areas susceptible to transmission of malarial Plasmodium parasites, dengue Flavivirus and Schistosoma worms. The transmission potential of the three associated vector-borne diseases studied is highly sensitive to climate changes on the periphery of the currently endemic areas and at higher altitudes within such areas. Our findings vis-a-vis the present endemic areas indicate that the increase in the epidemic potential of malaria and dengue transmission may be estimated at 12-27% and 31-47%, respectively, while in contrast, schistosomiasis transmission potential may be expected to exhibit a 11-17% decrease.",1
"Climate variation affects surface ocean processes and the production of organic carbon, which ultimately comprises the primary food supply to the deep-sea ecosystems that occupy approximate to 60% of the Earth's surface. Warming trends in atmospheric and upper ocean temperatures, attributed to anthropogenic influence, have occurred over the past four decades. Changes in upper ocean temperature influence stratification and can affect the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton production. Global warming has been predicted to intensify stratification and reduce vertical mixing. Research also suggests that such reduced mixing will enhance variability in primary production and carbon export flux to the deep sea. The dependence of deep-sea communities on surface water production has raised important questions about how climate change will affect carbon cycling and deep-ocean ecosystem function. Recently, unprecedented time-series studies conducted over the past two decades in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic at > 4,000-m depth have revealed unexpectedly large changes in deep-ocean ecosystems significantly correlated to climate-driven changes in the surface ocean that can impact the global carbon cycle. Climate-driven variation affects oceanic communities from surface waters to the much-overlooked deep sea and will have impacts on the global carbon cycle. Data from these two widely separated areas of the deep ocean provide compelling evidence that changes in climate can readily influence deep-sea processes. However, the limited geographic coverage of these existing time-series studies stresses the importance of developing a more global effort to monitor deep-sea ecosystems under modern conditions of rapidly changing climate.",1
"Regional paleoclimate reconstructions for northern Canada quantify Holocene climate variability on orbital and millennial time scales and provide a context to better understand the current global warming. The reconstructions are based on available pollen diagrams from the boreal and low Arctic zones of Canada and use the modern analog technique (MAT). Four regional reconstructions document the space-time evolution of the climate during the Holocene. Highest summer and winter temperatures anomalies are found in central Canada during the early Holocene. Eastern Canada was relatively cool in the early Holocene, whereas central Canada was warmest at that time. Labrador was relatively dry in the early to mid-Holocene during which time western Canada was relatively moist. Millennial-scale temperature variations, especially the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age are seen across the continent, with some suggestion of time-transgressive changes from west to east. At the millennial scale, precipitation anomalies are of opposite signs in eastern and western Canada. The results herein indicate that modern increases in temperatures in northern Canada far exceed natural millennial-scale climate variability.",1
"Plantago lanceolata plants were grown under various environmental conditions in association with the mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae, G. caledonium and a fine endophyte either individually or all together. Using a time-course approach, we investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)), soil warming and drought and their interactions on root length colonized (RLC) by mycorrhizal fungi and extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) production. Plant growth responded as would be expected to the environmental manipulations. There was no plant growth-independent effect of eCO(2) on mycorrhizal colonization; however, EMH production was stimulated by eCO(2), i.e. there was increased partitioning of below-ground carbon to the EMH. Soil warming directly stimulated both percent RLC by the Glomus species and EMH density; soil warming did not affect RLC by the fine endophyte. Drought decreased percent RLC for the fine endophyte, but not for the Glomus species. The presence of one mycorrhizal fungus did not affect the response of another to the environmental variables. There was no evidence of any interactive effects of the environmental variables on RLC, but there were significant environmental interactions on EMH production. In particular, the stimulatory effects of eCO(2) and soil warming on EMH density were not additive. The results are discussed in terms of the soil carbon cycle, highlighting some crucial gaps in our knowledge. If future environmental changes affect mycorrhizal fungal turnover and respiration, then this could have important implications for the terrestrial carbon cycle.",1
"The Earth is warming on average, and most of the global warming of the past half-century can very likely be attributed to human influence. But the climate in particular locations is much more variable, raising the question of where and when local changes could become perceptible enough to be obvious to people in the form of local warming that exceeds interannual variability; indeed only a few studies have addressed the significance of local signals relative to variability. It is well known that the largest total warming is expected to occur in high latitudes, but high latitudes are also subject to the largest variability, delaying the emergence of significant changes there. Here we show that due to the small temperature variability from one year to another, the earliest emergence of significant warming occurs in the summer season in low latitude countries (approximate to 25 degrees S-25 degrees N). We also show that a local warming signal that exceeds past variability is emerging at present, or will likely emerge in the next two decades, in many tropical countries. Further, for most countries worldwide, a mean global warming of 1 degrees C is sufficient for a significant temperature change, which is less than the total warming projected for any economically plausible emission scenario. The most strongly affected countries emit small amounts of CO(2) per capita and have therefore contributed little to the changes in climate that they are beginning to experience.",1
"Signals of anthropogenic warming over Europe are searched for in the spatial trend patterns for the variance and skewness (expressed by the 10th and 90th percentiles) of the distribution of daily mean temperature. Comparisons are made between these patterns in the station records of the European Climate Assessment dataset for the 1976-99 period, the patterns associated with natural variability in the observations (which were empirically derived from the observations in the 1946-75 period), and the patterns of future warming and natural variability as simulated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model in the Challenge ensemble experiment. The results indicate that, on the basis of the patterns for the variance, a distinction can be made between temperature change due to natural variability and temperature change due to changes in external forcing. The observed variance trend patterns for the spring (March-May) and summer (June-August) warming 1976-99 are clearly different from the patterns for the change in variance associated with a warming due to natural variability in the observations. This led us to conclude that a change in an external forcing has to be invoked to explain the observed spring and summer warming. From the evaluation of the greenhouse and natural variability patterns in the climate model simulations, we infer that the observed spring and summer variance trend patterns contain imprints consistent with anthropogenic warming. The analysis of the variance trend patterns for the winter (December-February) season is inconclusive about identifying causes of the observed warming for that season. Unlike the other three seasons, the autumn (September-November) is for Europe a period of cooling in recent decades. The observed variance trend pattern for this season closely resembles the estimated pattern for the change in variance associated with a cooling due to natural variability, indicating that the observed autumn cooling can be ascribed to random weather variations in the period under consideration.

"ACTUAL and potential increases in aircraft traffic are causing concern about the effects of aircraft exhaust emission on atmospheric chemistry. Model results 1-3 and measurements 4-6 in the Northern Hemisphere have shown that growth in surface emissions of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons leads to increases in concentration of tropospheric ozone. Tropospheric ozone is toxic to plants, humans and other organisms, and it is a greenhouse gas 7-9. The radiative forcing of surface temperature is most sensitive to changes in tropospheric ozone at a height of approximately 12 km (ref. 8), where aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides are at a maximum and where the model sensitivity of ozone to nitrogen oxide emissions is enhanced. Our model results show that the radiative forcing of surface temperature is about thirty times more sensitive to aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides than to surface emissions. We also find that the impact on global warming of increases in tropospheric ozone caused by increases in surface emissions of nitrogen oxides has previously been overestimated by a factor of five 1,10, owing to an error in the calculation of the ozone budget.",1
"About 65% of all emissions of nitrous oxide, N2O, are from soils, and are caused by aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification. Tropical forest soils are probably the most important single source, followed by cultivated soils. Emission rates in natural systems are related to the rate of N mineralization from organic matter, and N deposition; in agricultural systems they are related to the quantities of N used as fertilizers and, where relevant, to recent land use change. The global budget for N2O is not well balanced, and sources may still be underestimated. Direct evidence of a positive feedback of global warming on N2O emissions comes from studies of air in ice cores. One of the projected effects of future global warming is a lowering of water tables in northern peatlands; experiments suggest that this would lead to increased emissions, but that the effect on total emissions would be small. The results of many experiments with non-peatland soils indicate that the effect of temperature on soil emissions is generally positive, and that the rate of increase may be very steep when denitrification is the principal process involved. process-level modelling suggests that the reason is increased soil respiration, which causes an increase in anaerobic volume in which denitrification can take place, in addition to the increased denitrification rate per unit anaerobic volume brought about directly by the rise in temperature. These results imply that generally a positive feedback on emissions from soils is likely. However, in some environments, a large proportion of total annual emissions can occur during freeze-thaw cycles; such cycles may become more or less frequent, depending on the climatic zone, and this may result in either a positive or negative feedback effect due to global warming. Models of global and regional trends give very conflicting predictions of the direction and the magnitude of climatic impacts on fluxes, but the prediction of a positive feedback seems to be the more soundly based.",1
"Relative contributions of diverse, managed ecosystems to greenhouse gases are not completely documented. This study was conducted to estimate soil surface fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)), and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) as affected by management practices and weather. Gas fluxes were measured by vented, static chambers in Drummer and Raub soil series during two growing seasons. Treatments evaluated were corn cropped continuously (CC) or in rotation with soybean (CS) and fertilized with in-season urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) or liquid swine manure applied in the spring (SM) or fall (FM). Soybean (SC) rotated with CS and restored prairie grass (PC) were also included. The CO(2) fluxes correlated (P <= 0.001) with soil temperature (rho: 0.74) and accumulated rainfall 120 h before sampling (rho: 0.53); N(2)O fluxes correlated with soil temperature (rho: 0.34). Seasonal CO(2)-C emissions were not different across treatments (4.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but differed between years. Manured soils were net seasonal CH(4)-C emitters (0-159-0.329 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), whereas CSUAN and CCUAN exhibited CH(4)-C uptake (-0.128 and -0-177 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Treatments significantly influenced seasonal N(2)O-Nemissions (P<0.001) and ranged from <0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in PG and SC to between 3 and 5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in CUM and CSUAN and >8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in CCSM; differences were driven by pulse emissions after N fertilization in concurrence with major rainfall events. These results suggest fall manure application, corn-soybean rotation, and restoration of prairies may diminish N(2)O emissions and hence contribute to global warming mitigation.",1
"BACKGROUND: Climate change is anticipated to affect human health by changing the distribution of known risk factors. Heat waves have had debilitating effects on human mortality, and global climate models predict an increase in the frequency and severity of heat waves. The extent to which climate change will harm human health through changes in the distribution of heat waves and the sources of uncertainty in estimating these effects have not been studied extensively. OBJECTIVES: We estimated the future excess mortality attributable to heat waves under global climate change for a major U.S. city. METHODS: We used a database comprising daily data from 1987 through 2005 on mortality from all nonaccidental causes, ambient levels of particulate matter and ozone, temperature, and dew point temperature for the city of Chicago, Illinois. We estimated the associations between heat waves and mortality in Chicago using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Under three different climate change scenarios for 2081-2100 and in the absence of adaptation, the city of Chicago could experience between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths per year attributable to heat waves, based on estimates from seven global climate models. We noted considerable variability in the projections of annual heat wave mortality; the largest source of variation was the choice of climate model. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of future heat waves on human health will likely be profound, and significant gains can be expected by lowering future carbon dioxide emissions.",1
"One of the predicted biological responses to climate warming is the upslope displacement of species distributions. In the tropics, because montane assemblages frequently include local endemics that are distributed close to summits, these species may be especially vulnerable to experiencing complete habitat loss from warming. However, there is currently a dearth of information available for tropical regions. Here, we present a preliminary appraisal of this extinction threat using the herpetological assemblage of the Tsaratanana Massif in northern Madagascar (the island's highest massif), which is rich with montane endemism. We present meteorological evidence (individual and combined regional weather station data and reanalysis forecast data) for recent warming in Madagascar, and show that this trend is consistent with recent climate model simulations. Using standard moist adiabatic lapse rates, these observed meteorological warming trends in northern Madagascar predict upslope species displacement of 17-74 m per decade between 1993 and 2003. Over this same period, we also report preliminary data supporting a trend for upslope distribution movements, based on two surveys we completed at Tsaratanana. For 30 species, representing five families of reptiles and amphibians, we found overall mean shifts in elevational midpoint of 19-51 m upslope (mean lower elevation limit 29-114 m; mean upper elevation limit -8 to 53 m). We also found upslope trends in mean and median elevational observations in seven and six of nine species analysed. Phenological differences between these surveys do not appear to be substantial, but these upslope shifts are consistent with the predictions based on meteorological warming. An elevational range displacement analysis projects complete habitat loss for three species below the 2 degrees C 'dangerous' warming threshold. One of these species is not contracting its distribution, but the other two were not resampled in 2003. A preliminary review of the other massifs in Madagascar indicates potential similar vulnerability to habitat loss and upslope extinction. Consequently, we urgently recommend additional elevational surveys for these and other tropical montane assemblages, which should also include, when possible, the monitoring of local meteorological conditions and habitat change.",1
"It is considered that large-scale afforestation in arid and semi-arid land is one of the most promising countermeasures for fixation of carbon dioxide, which is mainly responsible for the global warming problem. Afforestation of arid land is hindered by water shortages, and requires more effective utilization of limited rainwater. The concept of this study is to evaluate the various countermeasures for constructing water balance system, from different viewpoints of conventional element-technology-oriented measures. In this study, Leonora in Western Australia was selected as a research area, and the infiltration process in the area was analyzed by two kinds of simulation models. Their validity was tested by comparing with the experimental results using glass beads with simple characteristics. It was clearly demonstrated that each model has its own problems. Then we evaluated the infiltration rate of precipitated water into Australian specific soil by the model which showed better approximation results to the experiments with glass beads. As a result, it is suggested that the poor permeability of the soil limits plant growth in the Australian specific area.",1
"In Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass combustion are traditionally assumed climate neutral if the bioenergy system is CO2 flux neutral, i.e. the quantity of CO2 released approximately equals the amount of CO2 sequestered in biomass. This convention is a plausible assumption for fast growing biomass species, but is inappropriate for slower growing biomass, like forests. In this case, the climate impact from biomass combustion can be potentially underestimated if CO2 emissions are ignored, or overestimated, if biogenic CO2 is considered equal to anthropogenic CO2. The estimation of the effective climate impact should take into account how the CO2 fluxes are distributed over time: the emission of CO2 from bioenergy approximately occurs at a single point in time, while the absorption by the new trees is spread over several decades. Our research target is to include this dynamic time dimension in unit-based impact analysis, using a boreal forest stand as case study. The boreal forest growth is modelled with an appropriate function, and is investigated under different forestry regimes (affecting the growth rate and the year of harvest). Specific atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived CO2 are then elaborated for selected combinations of forest management options. The contribution to global warming is finally quantified using the GWP(bio); index as climate metric. Results estimates the effects of these practices on the characterization factor used for the global warming potential of CO2 from bioenergy, and point out the key role played by the selected time horizon.

"Sports facilities have been shown to have a positive impact on local biodiversity, quality of life, and the economy. Their impact on global carbon balances is less clearly understood. Increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) have been linked with global climate change. Currently there is a debate as to whether amenity turf is a net source or a net sink for atmospheric CO2. The turf grass of a natural sports pitch will sequester carbon through photosynthesis, but there are numerous emission sources associated with the management of turf which release CO2 into the atmosphere. These include the engines used to power mechanized operations such as mowing and spraying, the application of agrochemicals, including fertilizers, and the disposal of waste. In order to determine whether a real-world example of a sports facility was a source or sink of carbon a mechanistic mass balance model was developed. Analysis indicated that the areas of the golf course that received the most management attention were a net source of carbon emissions. The magnitude of these releases was significantly different on an equal-area basis (p < 0.01). The net carbon budget for turf grass areas across the whole golf course accounting for the sequestration by the turfgrass was -33.01 Mg C/year. The mature trees that formed an integral part of the landscape of the modelled course had a significant impact on the net carbon balance, resulting in overall net sequestration of -177.3 Mg C/year for the whole golf course, equivalent to -93 Mg C/ha/year. The variability in the size, shape, and vegetation composition of different golf courses has a considerable impact on their net carbon balance, and the resultant environmental impact of sports facilities must be assessed on an individual basis.",1
"It has been well recognized that converting wetlands to cropland results in loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), while less attention was paid to concomitant changes in methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions. Using datasets from the literature and field measurements, we investigated loss of SOC and emissions of CH(4) and N(2)O due to marshland conversion in northeast China. Analysis of the documented crop cultivation area indicated that 2.91 Mha of marshland were converted to cropland over the period 1950-2000. Marshland conversion resulted in SOC loss of similar to 240 Tg and introduced similar to 4 Tg CH(4) and similar to 138 Gg N(2)O emissions in the cropland, while CH(4) emissions reduced greatly in the marshland, cumulatively similar to 28 Tg over the 50 years. Taking into account the loss of SOC and emissions of CH(4) and N(2)O, the global warming potential (GWP) at a 20-year time horizon was estimated to be similar to 180 Tg CO(2)_eq. yr-1 in the 1950s and similar to 120 Tg CO(2)_eq. yr-1 in the 1990s, with a similar to 33% reduction. When calculated at 100-year time horizon, the GWP was similar to 73 Tg CO(2) _eq. yr-1 in the 1950s and similar to 58 Tg CO(2)_eq. yr-1 in the 1990s, with a similar to 21% reduction. It was concluded that marshland conversion to cropland in northeast China reduced the greenhouse effect as far as GWP is concerned. This reduction was attributed to a substantial decrease in CH(4) emissions from the marshland. An extended inference is that the declining growth rate of atmospheric CH(4) since the 1980s might be related to global loss of wetlands, but this connection needs to be confirmed.",1
"The impact of a CO2-induced global warming on ENSO-like fluctuations in a global coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM is analyzed using two multi-century experiments. In the 4xCO2 experiment, CO2 increases by a factor of four in the first 140 years and then remains constant at 4xCO2 for another 360 years; in the control experiment, CO2 remains constant at 1xCO2 for 1000 years. The standard deviation of tropical Pacific SST fluctuations (7-degrees-N-7-degrees-S, 173-degrees-E-120-degrees-W; 2 to 15 year timescales) is 24% lower in the 4xCO2 experiment than in the control experiment; for the model's Southern Oscillation Index, a 19% decrease occurs, whereas for central tropical Pacific rainfall, a 3% increase occurs. An important feature of the control simulation is the internally generated modulation of variability on a multi-century timescale, which is comparable in magnitude to the changes occurring with 4xCO2. We conclude that despite an order 5 K warming of the tropical Pacific, and order 50% increase in time-mean atmospheric water vapor under 4xCO2 conditions, ENSO-like SST fluctuations in the coupled model do not intensify, but rather decrease slightly in amplitude.",1
"We use the method of surrogates to test the structure of variability in nine paleoclimate reconstructions and to compare temperature trends with that of the modern temperature record in the Northern hemisphere. Three different algorithms are used to generate surrogate time series: the iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (IAAFT), the statically transformed autoregressive process (STAP) and a modification of STAP, which generates surrogates of arbitrary length (STAPL). We assessed through formal statistical tests that the surrogates preserve the LTP structure of the reconstructed time series of global temperature, using different measures (Hurst exponent, DFA exponent and R/S analysis). Then using the same surrogates we tested for the presence of a linear trend at least as great as the trend of the modern time series against the null hypothesis that the observed trend is only due to LTP. The null hypothesis could be rejected at the lowest possible significance level for all but two of the reconstructions. The result from the non-parametric test adds further statistical evidence to that of earlier parametric studies that the observed global warming trend in the modern time series cannot be adequately explained by natural agents of variability.",1
"There is growing scientific and public concern that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will produce global warming and other climatic changes. Although economic activity is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions, information and incentive problems make it difficult to translate concern about global warming into economic behaviour and policy conducive to reducing emissions. The paper considers a set of near term (carbon tax), intermediate term (afforestation, energy efficiency) and long term (new non-fossil fuel technologies) strategies for reducing CO2 in the atmosphere. Each strategy has useful attributes, but shortcomings or limitations too. While the near term and intermediate term strategies can slow and perhaps reverse the growth of CO2 emissions, only a successful long term strategy of fostering the development of some promising non-fossil fuel technologies, such as solar and solar-hydrogen, can eventually halt the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere. Moreover, public investment in the development of new non-fossil fuel technologies would largely obviate the information and incentive problems that currently stand in the way of an economically viable greenhouse policy.",1
"Concern has been expressed that anthropogenic climate change may lead to a slowdown or even collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). Because of the possibly severe consequences that such an event could have on the northern North Atlantic and northwestern Europe, integrated assessment models (IAMs) are needed to explore the associated political and socioeconomic implications. State-of-the-art climate models representing the THC are, however, often too complex to be incorporated into an integrated assessment framework. In this paper we present a low-order model of the Atlantic THC which meets the main requirements of IAMs: it (1) is physically based, (2) is computationally highly efficient, (3) allows for comprehensive uncertainty analysis and (4) can be linked to globally aggregated climate models that are mostly used in IAMs. The model is an interhemispheric extension of the seminal Stommel model. Its parameters are determined by a least-squares fit to the output of a coupled climate model of intermediate complexity. Results of a number of transient global warming simulations indicate that the model is able to reproduce many features of the behaviour of coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation models such as the sensitivity of the THC to the amount, regional distribution and rate of climate change.",1
"The 1997 Indonesia forest fires was an environmental disaster of exceptional proportions. Such a disaster caused massive transboundary air pollution and indiscriminate destruction of biodiversity in the world. The immediate consequence of the fires was the production of large amounts of haze in the region, causing visibility and health problems within Southeast Asia. Furthermore, fires of these magnitudes are potential contributors to global warming and climate change due to the emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases and other pyrogenic products. The long-range transport of fire-related haze in the region is investigated using trajectories from the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research Limited Area Model(DARLAM). Emission scenarios were constructed for hotspot areas in Sumatra and Kalimantan For the months of September and October 1997 to determine the period and fire locations most critical to Singapore. This study also examines some transport issues raised from field observations. Results show that fires in the coastal areas of southeast Sumatra and southwest Kalimantan can be potential contributors to transboundary air pollution in Singapore. Singapore was directly affected by haze from these areas whereas Kuala Lumpur was heavily affected by the haze coming From Sumatra. In most cases, Singapore was more affected by fires from Kalimantan than was Kuala Lumpur. This was mainly a result of the shifting of monsoons. The transition of monsoons resulted in weaker low-level winds and shifted convergence zones near to the southeast of Peninsular Malaysia. In addition to severe drought and massive fire activity in 1997, the timing of the monsoon transition has a strong influence on haze transport in the region. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"A major factor in global warming is CO(2) emission from thermal power plants, which burn fossil fuels. One technology proposed to prevent global warming is CO(2) recovery from combustion flue gas and the sequestration Of CO(2) underground or near the ocean bed. Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) can produce highly concentrated CO(2), because the reformed fuel gas reacts with oxygen electrochemically without being mixed with air in the SOFC. We therefore propose to operate multi-staged SOFCs with high utilization of reformed fuel to obtain highly concentrated CO(2). In this study, we estimated the performance of multi-staged SOFCs considering H(2) diffusion and the combined cycle efficiency of a multi-staged SOFC/gas turbine/CO(2) recovery power plant. The power generation efficiency of our CO(2) recovery combined cycle is 68.5%, whereas the efficiency of a conventional SOFC/GT cycle with the CO(2) recovery amine process is 57.8%.

"Concern over global climate change has led policy makers to accept the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This in turn has led to a large growth in clean renewable generation for electricity production. Much emphasis has been on wind generation as it is among the most advanced forms of renewable generation, however, its variable and relatively unpredictable nature result in increased challenges for electricity system operators. Tidal generation on the other hand is almost perfectly forecastable and as such may be a viable alternative to wind generation. This paper calculates the break-even capital cost for tidal generation on a real electricity system. An electricity market model is used to determine the impact of tidal generation on the operating schedules of the conventional units on the system and on the resulting cycling costs, emissions and fuel savings. It is found that for tidal generation to produce positive net benefits for the case study, the capital costs would have to be less than epsilon 510,000 per MW installed which is currently an unrealistically low capital cost. Thus, it is concluded that tidal generation is not a viable option for the case system at the present time. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"An instrument for promoting CO2 emission reductions, taking the Kyoto Protocol goal into account, could be the assignment to energy conversion plants of a monetary charge linked to their specific emission intensity, usually called carbon tax. There are two main problems closely connected with this approach: the estimation of the charge (that must be related to the ""external"" cost associated with CO2 emission) and the choice of the strategy to determine the amount of the imposed charge. In this paper an analytical procedure proposed by the authors and called carbon exergy tax (CET) for the evaluation Of CO2 emission externalities is presented. It is based on the thermoeconomic analysis of energy systems, which allows second law losses to be quantified in monetary terms: the resulting cost represents the taxation that is to be applied to the energy system under examination, calculated without any arbitrary assumption. Since the complete procedure of the CET evaluation is too complex to become a feasible instrument of energy policy, hereby, after applying the procedure to some conventional and advanced power plants, gas, oil, and coal-fueled, a new generalized approach, based on the results of the complete CET procedure, is proposed. The generalized CET evaluation requires much less information about the energy system and thus a simple and effective energy policy rule to manage global warming is obtained and available.",1
"Over 80% of Canadians are urban dwellers, and geology plays a major role in their living environment. Aggregates, water supply, waste disposal, and building problems associated with compressible or sensitive sediments, swelling clays, and dense tills, are major urban geological concerns. A. variety of geological hazards impact our cities, including earthquakes, tsunami, volcanic eruptions, landslides, flooding and, along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, sea level rise. New urban challenges arise from declining reserves of fossil fuels and global climate change, both of which require a rapid transition to alternative energy sources (wind, solar, geothermal) and rebuilt infrastructure. Canada will increasingly face urban issues that require enhanced public education and the services of geologists.",1
"Phragmites australis wetlands act as a sink for greenhouse gases by photosynthetic assimilation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and sequestration of the organic matter produced in the wetland soil. The wetlands also act as a source for greenhouse gases by emission of sediment-produced methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. In P. australis wetlands, the dominant mechanism of CH4 release to the atmosphere is internal gas transport in the plants, primarily by pressurized convective gas flow. The time periods of carbon fixation and CH4 release therefore vary seasonally and diurnally. The balance between net CO2-assimilation and CH4 emission determines if a wetland can be regarded as a net sink or a net source of greenhouse gases, and hence, the function of the wetland in relation to global climate change. On an annual basis up to 15% of the net carbon fixed by the wetlands may be released to the atmosphere as CH4. Because of the different infrared absorption characteristics and atmospheric longevity of CH4 and CO2, the warming effect of CH4 in the atmosphere is about 21 times higher on a mass basis than CO2 over a 100-year timescale. Thus, the immediate carbon balance, coupled with the different physical characteristics of the two gases, would suggest that although some wetlands function as a net sink for CO. the wetlands still increase the greenhouse effect because of their release of CH4. However, the short adjustment time for CH4 in the atmosphere means that, over a longer time scale, the radiative forcing of CH4 is less relative to CO2 and the wetlands effectively become a sink for greenhouse gases. Wetlands may therefore be regarded as a source for greenhouse gases and so increase radiative forcing if evaluated on a short time scale (decades), but as a sink for greenhouse gases and thus attenuating radiative forcing if evaluated over longer time scales (>100 years).

"Current coupled ocean-atmosphere model (COAM) projections of future oceanic anthropogenic carbon uptake suggest reduced rates due to surface warming, enhanced stratification, and slowed thermohaline overturning. Such models rely on simple, bulk biogeochemical parameterisations, whereas recent ocean observations indicate that floristic shifts may be induced by climate variability, are widespread, complex, and directly impact biogeochemical cycles. We present a strategy to incorporate ecosystem function in COAM's and to evaluate the results in relation to region-specific ecosystem dynamics and interannual variability using a template of oceanic biogeographical provinces. Illustrative simulations for nitrogen fixers with an off-line multi-species, functional group model suggest significant changes by the end of this century in ecosystem structure, with some of the largest regional impacts caused by shifts in the areal extent of biomes.",1
"This paper discusses the limitations of applying the traditional economic tool of cost-benefit analysis to considering strategies that would mitigate the effects of global climate change. These studies are the basis for many policies that claim that addressing the risks of global climate change is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents another type of analytical framework-the end-use study. Used extensively by engineers and scientists, end-use studies attempt to project future energy needs and then consider how to best meet the expected need, which contrasts with traditional econometric methods that focus almost exclusively on energy pricing.",1
"Increased atmospheric CO2 and global warming may affect overall tree growth, but impacts of these combined stresses are largely unknown in terms of multiple growing season impacts on specific flushes. Thus, the effects of ambient or elevated CO2 (approximately 200 mu mol.mol(-1) above ambient) and ambient or elevated temperature (approximately 4 degrees C above ambient) were evaluated for both main and second (lammas) flushes of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France). Established seedlings were grown for three full growing seasons in outdoor, sunlit chambers, which maintained diel and seasonal variation in climate. A reconstructed forest soil was used with a seasonal wet and dry cycle and without added fertilizer. Compared with ambient CO2 elevated CO2 had no impact on overall phenology and growth of terminal shoots, needles, or buds. In contrast, compared with ambient temperature, elevated temperature resulted in higher shoot and needle growth rates early in the season; reduced final terminal shoot length; and either reduced, increased, or unchanged final needle length, depending on season. Initiation of the lammas flush was delayed and (or) decreased at elevated temperature. Leading terminal bud break and growth occurred earlier; however, resting bud length was reduced, and bud width tended to increase with elevated temperature. Thus, at least during early seedling growth, elevated temperatures may reduce both main- and lammas-flush growth, thereby altering tree productivity, whereas elevated CO2 may have little effect on main or lammas growth at either the current or elevated temperature.",1
"Perfluorocompounds (PFCs) are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry as etching gases and chamber cleaning gases. However, PFCs intensely absorb infrared radiation and aggravates global warming consequently. This study applies nonthermal plasma technologies to destroy PFCs including CF4, C2F6, SF6, and NF3. Four kinds of nonthermal plasma reactors including dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), packed-bed plasma (PBP), tandem packed-bed plasma (TPBP), and combined plasma catalysis (CPC) were constructed and tested. Experimental results indicated that higher oxygen and argon contents in the gas streams were beneficial to PFC abatement. For a single CPC reactor, the maximum removal efficiency achieved was 34%. The reduction requirement for semiconductor manufacturing (PFC abatement efficiency > 95%) could be accomplished by combining three CPC reactors in series. The maximum removal efficiency achieved and corresponding energy efficiency were both in the order of CPC > DBD > PBP > TPBP. Endproduct analysis indicated that CF4 was mainly converted into CO2, COF2, and CO. The selectivity of CO2 was in the trend of CPC > PBP > TPBP > DBD, being just reverse to the trend of COF2 selectivity. In general, CPC reactor performs with greater destruction efficiency, better energy utilization, and less hazardous products than the rest three reactors for PFC abatement.",1
"Global climate change, also known as global warming, is one of the most challenging elements of global environmental change. If atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" continue to increase, global mean air temperatures are expected to rise 5 degrees to 4.5 degrees C within the next several decades. High-latitude regions are projected to experience above-average increases. What effects would such a warming have in the Canadian Arctic? In a recently completed study of the Mackenzie Basin in northwestern Canada, regional stakeholders provided their responses to the ""what if?"" scenario of climate change in their region. This scenario includes more frequent landslides due to permafrost thaw, lower minimum annual river and lake levels, more forest fires, and lower yield from softwoods. These impacts could offset potential benefits from a longer growing and ice-free season. Regional stakeholders, including provincial and territorial governments, aboriginal organizations, and the private sector, felt confident about their abilities to adapt, so long as climate change would be predictable and gradual. Some potential impacts, however, could be very significant for renewable resources and aboriginal communities, and some stakeholders spoke of intervention into national and international policy arenas to raise awareness outside of the Mackenzie Basin.",1
"Instantaneous radiative forcing was calculated for 5 fluoroalcohols, 21 fluoroethers, and 5 fluoroamines which had been proposed as the replacement compounds for the currently used chlorofluorcarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration. Theatmospheric lifetimes of the compounds were also estimated from highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy. Based on the radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, halocarbon global warming potentials (HGWPs) were evaluated for the replacement compounds. Most of the HGWP values were smaller than 0.1 owing to their shorter lifetimes, and the results indicate that these compounds could be valid candidates as replacements for currently used CFCs from the point of view of HGWP. The spectral cooling rate profiles were calculated for the replacement compounds in order to study the vertical structure of their radiative effects. It was found that overlapping of the absorption bands of a compound with those of ozone causes a significant cooling in the stratosphere, even if the compound does not exist in the stratosphere. This cooling does not directly relate to the HGWP value and the cooling rate profile in the troposphere. Therefore, it can be said that the vertical structure of the radiative effects caused by the compounds should be taken into consideration as well as HGWP or GWP values when we assess the environmental effects due to replacement compounds. In this study, one parameter, defined as the ratio of the cooling rate at 30 km and the tropopause, was proposed as a measure of the cooling in the stratosphere. Spectral-resolution dependency of the calculated radiative effects was also studied. The results show that the resolution should be finer than about 50 cm(-1) to calculate the radiative forcing and cooling rate precisely.",1
"Arctic ecosystems are important in the context of global climate change because the most rapid rises in air temperature are expected at high northern latitudes during winter. The presence of extensive soil carbon reserves in the Arctic suggests that substantial feedbacks to CO(2)-induced climate change could occur if warming alters carbon cycling belowground. Characterization of the controls on regional patterns of belowground CO(2) release through the annual cycle is an important step towards evaluating potential feedbacks from arctic ecosystems to climate change. In this study, we assess seasonal control over the influences by climate and vegetation-type on CO(2) efflux from belowground in the Alaskan tundra. Our results indicate that climate had strong effects on belowground CO(2) release in both seasons. By contrast, vegetation-type had little impact on CO(2) efflux from belowground in winter but was the principal control in summer. Together, these results demonstrate that seasonality is a critical factor regulating climate and vegetation-type effects on belowground CO(2) release, which should be included in regional models of net carbon balance in arctic ecosystems.",1
"Scientific evidence indicates that a global climate change due to human activity is possible within a century. It is expected that doubling Of CO2 and increasing the amount of other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would result in more severe weather, among other consequences. The purpose of the paper is to examine how flood frequencies and magnitudes in a midsize subalpine watershed on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada, would change under 2 X CO2 conditions. Given the poor spatial resolution of present general circulation models (GCM) and their uncertain performance at the regional scale, a first-order analysis is carried on, in which only rainfall intensity changes are considered to have the most significant impact on future floods. Estimates of storm rainfall increases are based on the literature survey, GCM projections for the study area, and transposition of southern climatic conditions. Two scenarios of likely most severe changes were selected: first, a 25% increase in the mean and standard deviation of Gumbel distribution of rainfall depth for storm durations from 6 to 48 h; second, a 50% increase in the standard deviation only. The HEC-1 watershed model and the soil conservation service runoff curve method for abstractions were used in Monte Carlo simulation. Comparison of Monte Carlo derived flood frequency curves for the two scenarios with the present day curve shows that scenario I is more critical in terms of flood flow increases than scenario 2. Under scenario 1, the mean annual flood on the study watershed would increase by almost 80% and the 100-year flood would increase by 41%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Alluvial records of paleofloods show that natural floods resulting from excessive rainfall, snowmelt, or from combined rainfall and snowmelt are highly sensitive to even modest changes of climate equivalent or smaller than changes expected from potential future global warming in the 21st century. The high sensitivity results from effects of hemispheric or global-scale changes in circulation patterns of the ocean and atmosphere to influence the pathway's and locations of air masses and storm tracks. Holocene paleoflood chronologies from the Upper Mississippi Valley in the Midwest United States and from the Colorado River drainage of the Southwest United States show that recurrence frequencies of large floods have been subject to abrupt changes over time. These flood chronologies and hood chronologies observed for other middle-latitude regions suggest that recurrence frequencies of large hoods are increased when there is an increase in the number of waves and their amplitudes in the middle and upper tropospheric circum-polar westerly circulation. However, some middle-latitude regions on the western margins of continents experience increased frequencies of flooding during strong onshore zonal westerly circulation. Flood chronologies from several regions suggest that times of rapid climate change have a tendency to be associated with more frequent occurrences of large and extreme floods. The unusual high frequencies of large floods that have been observed in many regions since the early 1950s are often attributed to land use change, but the rapid climate forcing from the effects of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases may also be a contributing factor. Paleoflood records provide information that is useful for better interpretation and calibration of modern short-term instrumental records, and they provide unique event-scale information that is useful fbr calibrating and testing geophysical models of past and anticipated future climate conditions.

"Global warming is the observed increase of the average temperature of the Earth. The primary cause of this phenomenon is the release of the greenhouse gases by burning of fossil fuels, land cleaning, agriculture, among others, leading to the increase of the so-called greenhouse effect. An approach to deal with this important problem is the time series analysis. In this regard, different techniques can be applied to evaluate the global warming dynamics. This kind of analysis allows one to make better predictions increasing our comprehension of the phenomenon. This article applies nonlinear tools to analyze temperature time series establishing state space reconstruction and prediction. Since noise contamination is unavoidable in data acquisition, it is important to employ robust techniques. The method of delay coordinates is employed for state space reconstruction and delay parameters are evaluated using the method of average mutual information and the method of false nearest neighbors. Afterwards, the simple nonlinear prediction method is employed to estimate temperatures of the future. Temperature time series from different places of the planet are used. Initially, the approach is verified considering known parts of the time series and afterwards, results are extrapolated for future values estimating temperature until 2028. Results show that these techniques are interesting to estimate temperature time history, presenting coherent estimations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Droughts have significant environmental and socio-economic impacts in Australia. This emphasizes Australia's vulnerability to climate variability and limitations of adaptive capacity. Two drought indices are compared for their potential utility in resource management. The Rainfall Deciles-based Drought Index is a measure of rainfall deficiency while the Soil-Moisture Deciles-based Drought Index is a measure of soil-moisture deficiency attributed to rainfall and potential evaporation. Both indices were used to assess future drought events over Australia under global warming attributed to low and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SRES BI and AIFI respectively) for 30-year periods centred on 2030 and 2070. Projected consequential changes in rainfall and potential evaporation were based on results from the CCCmal and Mk2 climate models, developed by the Canadian Climate Center and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) respectively. A general increase in drought frequency associated with global warming was demonstrated by both indices for both climate models, except for the western part of Australia. Increases in the frequency of soil-moisture-based droughts are greater than increases in meteorological drought frequency. By 2030 in the frequency of soil-moisture-based drought frequency increases 20-40% over most of Australia with respect to 1975-2004 and up to 80% over the Indian Ocean and southeast coast catchments by 2070. Such increases in drought frequency would have major implications for natural resource management, water security planning, water demand management strategies, and drought relief payments.

"In this paper the mid-21st-century target level for industrial carbon dioxide emissions is analyzed, taking into account the very large uncertainty about abrupt climate change. Following a brief review of integrated assessments of abrupt climate change, this study introduces an extension of DICE-2007, an integrated assessment model for climate policy analysis, which contains a hazard function that connects the rise in air temperature with the probability of abrupt change. The probability of abrupt change under a certain air temperature conditions and the economic impact of abrupt change are treated as widely variable parameters. Graphic indications of the combination of these parameters for several emission targets using the extended model show the necessity of developing adaptation measures to control the economic loss from abrupt change to below 8%, as well as to restrain global industrial carbon emissions in 2055 to the same level as those in 2005, assuming a most likely equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C. Although a more stringent emissions target may be suggested in the spirit of precaution, it may lead to excessive carbon reduction from the viewpoint of cost-benefit balancing.",1
"Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions are becoming significant energy and environmental issues relating to energy consumption in Taiwan. The nation, although not a party to the Montreal Protocol and Kyoto Protocol, has diligently strived to mitigate the emissions and phase out use of the responsible materials. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are now mostly used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, are the main GHGs associated with strong global warming potential. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the industrial/commercial uses of HFCs in Taiwan. Because of their high impacts on climate change, the description is then centered on estimating the potential emissions of HFCs according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method and the governmental organizations responses to the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The regulatory systems relating to HFCs mitigation and energy conservation and energy policies and promotion measures for providing technological assistances and financial incentives in the energy management, resource recovery and HFCs reduction/recycling technologies are also addressed in the paper.

"Placing reflectors in the stratosphere or in higher-altitude space to shade sunlight is expected to be a promising geoengineering option for use as a countermeasure against climate change. While the sunshade technology has been evaluated from earth-scientific viewpoints, no study has evaluated when and on what scale it can be deployed from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint, presuming that it is used in combination with CO(2) abatement options as a pillar of the mitigation of climatic change. Nor have the contributions of geoengineering research and development to the economics of overall climate control measures been evaluated. Such evaluations are attempted in this study, which focuses on a space-based sunshade technology. As a result, it is recommended that radiative forcing be reduced by 0.8 W/m(2) through the sunshades over a period of approximately a century from the latter half of the 21st century. In this case, an increase in global CO(2) emissions by some 15% is allowed in the former half of the 21st century, and the total climate control cost is reducible by 240 billion constant 2005 US$ on a present value basis compared to the case in which the sunshades are unavailable. To enjoy the above advantages, the mass of the sunshade stock required to offset the increase in radiative forcing due to a doubling of the atmospheric CO(2) concentration should be lower than 100 Mt/2xCO(2) assuming a continuous decline in the cost of placing (space-launching) sunshades from 6000 to 1000 US$/kg over a half-century.

"Goal, Scope and Background. Enzymes are biological catalysts with an enormous capacity to increase the speed of a huge variety biochemical reactions. Industrially produced enzymes are used in a broad variety of sectors to increase quality, speed and yield of processes, and reduce energy consumption and use of hazardous chemicals. The present paper provides a methodological framework for analysing environmental impacts of enzyme products and environmental data for five characteristic enzyme products. Methods. Life cycle assessment is used as an analytical tool and modelling of enzyme production is facilitated in SimaPro 6.0 software. Detailed data on enzyme production are derived from Novozymes' production facilities in Denmark. Data on ingredients are derived from the literature, publicly available databases and from Novozymes' suppliers. Results and Conclusions. Cradle-to-gate environmental data for five representative enzyme products produced by Novozymes in Denmark have been determined, and a basis for further assessments of more of Novozymes' enzyme products has been established. Environmental impacts induced by producing the considered enzyme products vary by a factor 10 or more depending on the impact category considered. Contributions to global warming range, for example, between one and ten kg CO2-equivalents per kg final product. The variation is explained by differences in fermentation time, formulation type, production yield and strength of the final product. The main sources of environmental impact are usually fermentation processes due to electricity and ingredient consumption. Enzyme production has been the subject of significant optimisation during the past decades by implementation of e.g. gene modified production strains, and the provided environmental data are only representative to enzyme products produced by Novozymes at the present optimisation stage. Recommendations and Perspectives. Novozymes produces more than 600 enzyme products for use in a variety of sectors, and the established framework for environmental assessment will be used for assessing more products in order to provide a broad basis for environmental comparison of enzyme assisted technologies and conventional technologies.",1
"Greenhouse gas emissions, nitrogen and phosphorous losses through ammonia volatilization, leaching and surface drainage from rice paddy under efficient irrigation and drainage were analyzed based on field experimental data in order to reveal the eco-environmental impacts of efficient irrigation and drainage on rice paddy. The results showed that total methane emission from rice paddy under the controlled irrigation was reduced by more than 80% and total nitrous oxide emission increased by 15.9% compared with flooding irrigation. Seasonal comprehensive global warming potentials (GWP) of methane and nitrous oxide were 62.23 gCO(2) m(-2) for rice paddy under the controlled irrigation, reduced by 68.0% compared with flooding irrigation. Due to large reduction in seepage and surface drainages, nitrogen and phosphorous losses through leaching were reduced by 40.1% and 54.8%, nitrogen and phosphorous losses through surface drainage were reduced by 53.9% and 56% from rice paddy under efficient irrigation and drainage compared with traditional irrigation and drainage. Nitrogen loss through ammonia volatilization was reduced by 14.0%. Efficient irrigation and drainage management is helpful to mitigate greenhouse gases emission, nitrogen and phosphorus losses and their pollution on groundwater and surface water.",1
"With the purpose of assessing the environmental impacts and benefits of the current municipal solid waste management system and two modified systems, EASEWASTE, a life-cycle-based model, was used to evaluate the waste system of Hangzhou city in China. An integrated model was established, including waste generation, collection, transportation, treatment, disposal and accompanying external processes. The results showed that CH(4) released from landfilling was the primary pollutant contributing to global warming, and HCl and NH(3) from incineration contributed most to acidification. Material recycling and incineration with energy recovery were important because of the induced savings in material production based on virgin materials and in energy production based on coal combustion. A modified system in which waste is transported to the nearest incinerators would be relatively better than the current system, mainly due to the decrease of pollution from landfilled waste and the increase in energy production from waste avoiding energy production by traditional power plants. A ban on free plastic bags for shopping was shown to reduce most environmental impacts due to saved oil resources and other materials used in producing the plastic bags. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. LCA methodology and a model like EASEWASTE are very suitable for evaluating the overall environmental consequences, and can be used for decision support and strategic planning in developing countries such as China where pollution control has become increasingly important with the rapid increase of waste generation as well as the increasing public awareness of environmental protection.",1
"Terrestrial ecosystems and the climate system are closely coupled, particularly by cycling of carbon between vegetation, soils and the atmosphere. It has been suggested(1,2) that changes in climate and in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have modified the carbon cycle so as to render terrestrial-ecosystems as substantial carbon sinks(3,4); but direct evidence for this is very limited(5,6). Changes in ecosystem carbon stocks caused by shifts between stable climate states have been evaluated(7,8), but the dynamic responses of ecosystem carbon fluxes to transient climate changes are still poorly understood. Here we use a terrestrial biogeochemical model(9), forced by simulations of transient climate change with a general circulation model(10), to quantify the dynamic variations in ecosystem carbon fluxes induced by transient changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate from 1861 to 2070. We predict that these changes increase global net ecosystem production significantly, but that this response will decline as the CO2 fertilization effect becomes saturated and is diminished by changes in climatic factors. Thus terrestrial ecosystem carbon fluxes both respond to and strongly influence the atmospheric CO2 increase and climate change.",1
"This study uses statistical downscaling to estimate the impact of future climate change on air quality. We employ historical observations of surface ozone (O-3) over the Chicago area, large-scale climate variables from the National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP) reanalysis data, and climate projections from three GCMs (GFDL, PCM, and HadCM3), driven by two SRES emission scenarios (A1FI and B1 for GFDL and PCM; A2 and B1 for HadCM3). This approach calculates historic relationships between meteorology and O-3, and considers how future meteorology would affect ground-level O-3 if these relationships remain constant. Ozone mixing ratios over Chicago are found to be most sensitive to surface temperature, horizontal surface winds, surface relative humidity, incoming solar radiation, and cloud cover. Considering the change in O-3 due to global climate change alone, summertime (June, July, and August) mean mixing ratios over Chicago are projected to increase by 6 - 17 ppb by the end of the century, depending on assumptions about global economic growth and choice of GCM. Changes are greater under higher climate emissions scenarios and more sensitive climate models (e. g. 24 ppb for GFDL A1FI as compared to 2 ppb for PCM B1). However, this approach does not take into account changes in O-3-precursor emissions nor changes in local and lake-effect meteorology, which could combine with climate change to either enhance or diminish the projected change in local mixing ratios. Statistical downscaling is performed with the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM v. 4.1, a publicly available scientific analysis and decision-support tool.",1
"We present results from multiple comprehensive models used to simulate an aggressive mitigation scenario based on detailed results of an Integrated Assessment Model. The experiment employs ten global climate and Earth System models (GCMs and ESMs) and pioneers elements of the long-term experimental design for the forthcoming 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment. Atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentrations pathways rather than carbon emissions are specified in all models, including five ESMs that contain interactive carbon cycles. Specified forcings also include minor greenhouse gas concentration pathways, ozone concentration, aerosols (via concentrations or precursor emissions) and land use change (in five models). The new aggressive mitigation scenario (E1), constructed using an integrated assessment model (IMAGE 2.4) with reduced fossil fuel use for energy production aimed at stabilizing global warming below 2 K, is studied alongside the medium-high non-mitigation scenario SRES A1B. Resulting twenty-first century global mean warming and precipitation changes for A1B are broadly consistent with previous studies. In E1 twenty-first century global warming remains below 2 K in most models, but global mean precipitation changes are higher than in A1B up to 2065 and consistently higher per degree of warming. The spread in global temperature and precipitation responses is partly attributable to inter-model variations in aerosol loading and representations of aerosol-related radiative forcing effects. Our study illustrates that the benefits of mitigation will not be realised in temperature terms until several decades after emissions reductions begin, and may vary considerably between regions. A subset of the models containing integrated carbon cycles agree that land and ocean sinks remove roughly half of present day anthropogenic carbon emissions from the atmosphere, and that anthropogenic carbon emissions must decrease by at least 50% by 2050 relative to 1990, with further large reductions needed beyond that to achieve the E1 concentrations pathway. Negative allowable anthropogenic carbon emissions at and beyond 2100 cannot be ruled out for the E1 scenario. There is self-consistency between the multi-model ensemble of allowable anthropogenic carbon emissions and the E1 scenario emissions from IMAGE 2.4.",1
"Future climate change induced by atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases is believed to have a large impact on the global carbon cycle. Several offline studies focusing either on the marine or on the terrestrial carbon cycle highlighted such potential effects. Two recent online studies, using ocean-atmosphere general circulation models coupled to land and ocean carbon cycle models, investigated in a consistent way the feedback between the climate change and the carbon cycle. These two studies used observed anthropogenic CO2 emissions for the 1860-1995 period and IPCC scenarios for the 1995-2100 period to force the climate-carbon cycle models. The study from the Hadley Centre group showed a very large positive feedback, atmospheric CO2 reaching 980 ppmv by 2100 if future climate impacts on the carbon cycle, but only about 700 ppmv if the carbon cycle is included but assumed to be insensitive to the climate changed The IPSL coupled climate carbon cycle model simulated a much smaller positive feedback: climate impact on the carbon cycle leads by 2100 to an addition of less than 100 ppmv in the atmosphere. Here we perform a detailed feedback analysis to show that such differences are due to two key processes that are still poorly constrained in these coupled models: first Southern Ocean circulation, which primarily controls the geochemical uptake of CO2 and second vegetation and soil carbon response to global warming. Our analytical analysis reproduces remarkably the results obtained by the fully coupled models. Also it allows us to identify that, amongst the two processes mentioned above, the latter (the land response to global warming) is the one that essentially explains the differences between the IPSL and the Hadley results.",1
"For the purposes of estimating local changes in surface climate at selected stations in the central Argentina region, induced by an enhanced CO, concentration, projected by general circulation models (GCM), a statistical method to derive local scale monthly mean minimum, maximum and mean temperatures from large-scale atmospheric predictors is presented. Empirical relationships are derived among selected variables from the NCEP re-analyses and local data for summer and winter months, tested against an independent set of observed data and subsequently applied to the MADAM and MPI GCM control runs. Finally, the statistical approach is applied to a climate change experiment performed with the MPI model to construct a local climate change scenario. The comparison between the estimated versus the observed mean temperature fields shows good agreement and the temporal evolution of the estimated variables is well-captured, though, the estimated temperatures contain less interannual variability than the observations. For the present day climate simulation, the results from the HADAM and MPI GCMs are used. It is shown that the pattern of estimated temperatures obtained using the MPI large-scale predictors matches the observations for summer months, though minimum and mean temperatures are slightly underestimated in the southeast part of the domain. However, the differences are well within the range of the observed variability. The possible anthropogenic climate change at the local scale is assessed by applying the statistical method to the results of the perturbed run conducted with the MPI model. For summer and winter months, the local temperature increase is smaller for minimum temperature than for maximum temperature for almost all the stations, yielding an enhanced temperature amplitude in both seasons. The temperature amplitude (difference between maximum and minimum) for summer months was larger than for winter months. The estimated maximum temperature increase is found to be larger for summer months than for winter months for all the stations, while for the minimum, temperature increases for summer and winter months are similar.

"The use of Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) to calculate 'equivalent' carbon dioxide emissions reductions in the climate change context is examined. We find that GWPs are accurate only for short time horizons. Over long time horizons their use implicitly leads to tradeoffs between near-term and long-term climate change. For one of the most policy-relevant cases, comparing reductions in methane and carbon dioxide, the long-term effect on climate of reducing methane emissions is relatively small, at variance with the common perception based on published GWP values.",1
"China's growing demand for energy - and its dependence on coal - has seen its carbon emissions increase more than 50% since 2000. Within the debate about mitigating global climate change, there is mounting pressure for emerging economies like China to take more responsibility for reducing their carbon emissions within a post-2012 international climate change policy framework. For China, this leads to fundamental questions about how feasible it is for the country to shift away from its recent carbon intensive pattern of growth. This paper presents some general results of scenarios that have been developed to investigate how China might continue to develop within a cumulative carbon emissions budget. The results show how changes in the key sectors of the Chinese economy could enable China to follow four different low carbon development pathways, each of which complies with a cumulative emissions constraint. Each scenario reflects different priorities for governmental decision making, infrastructure investments and social preferences. Having compared the key features of each scenario, the paper concludes with some implications for Chinese government policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"This study discusses an approach to measuring and improving the economic and ecological efficiency of Kyoto Mechanism projects. The approach consists of Global Warming Eco-Efficiency (GWEE), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) & joint Implementation (JI) Environmental-Efficiency (EE) and CDM & JI Economic-Productivity (EP). The GWEE indicator is based on the ratio of the value added of a system to its global warming influence in order to measure the eco-efficiency of a product in terms of the global warming issue. In addition, CDM & JI EE and CDM & JI EP are proposed to measure the environmental and economic performances of CDM and JI projects, respectively. While EE is defined as the ratio of the Certified Emission Reductions (CER) obtained from a CDM project or Emission Reduction Unit (ERU) from a JI project to total global warming influence relevant to the CDM or JI implemented, EP is defined as the ratio of the total of CER profit (and ERU profit) and the sales revenue to the costs of the CDM (and JI) implemented, Then, the feasibility of these indicators is examined through a case study for the power generations in the field of alternative energy.

"The Kyoto Protocol marks a break through in global warming mitigation policies as it sets legally binding emissions targets for major emitting regions. However, realization of the Protocol depends on the clarification of several issues, one of which is the permissible scope of international emissions trading between signatory countries. Unrestricted trade produces hot air when signatory countries, whose Kyoto targets are well above their business as usual emissions, trade in larger amounts of ""abundant"" emission rights. Concerns on hot air motivated proposals for caps on emissions trading by the EU. These caps are strictly refused by the USA and other non-European industrialized countries who want to exploit the full efficiency gains from trade. In this paper we show that there are ""cooling down"" strategies which can reconcile both positions. International permit trade provides enough efficiency gains to make all signatory countries better off than they would be without permit trade while mitigating hot air. In other words, part of the efficiency gains from free trade could be used to pay for higher abatement targets of signatory countries which assure the same environmental effectiveness as compared to strictly domestic action or restricted permit trade.

"We have reviewed the responses of soil fauna to increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and the consequent climate change. These will affect several attributes of animal populations and communities including their density, biomass, diversity, activity, rates of consumption, life history parameters and migration ability. Changes in the quality and quantity of litter and global warming are the main factors which are expected to modify soil fauna. Although changes have been observed in several attributes of the soil fauna as a consequence of increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2, no general trend which might allow to the prediction of a general pattern of response has been identified. Because of the complexity of the biological mechanisms and the synergetic action of several factors, the few resulting responses reported in the literature are inconclusive. However, some aspects of the situation deserve more attention. These include the consequences of (1) changes in the food resources for soil fauna in the litter layer and in the rhizosphere, (2) the consumption of low quality litter by the macrofauna, (3) the change in life span in response to temperature elevation, (4) the enhancement of earthworm burrowing activity and (5) the changes in community composition arising because of specific differential resistance to adverse conditions.",1
"Somali Jet changes will influence the variability of Asian monsoon and climate. How would Somali Jet changes respond to the global warming in the future climate? To address this question, we first evaluate the ability of IPCC-AR4 climate models and perform the 20th century climate in coupled models (20C3M) experiments to reproduce the observational features of the low level Somali Jet in JJA (June-July-August) for the period 1976-1999. Then, we project and discuss the changes of Somali Jet under the climate change of Scenario A2 (SRESA2) for the period 2005-2099. The results show that 18 IPCC-AR4 models have performed better in describing the climatological features of Somali Jet in the present climate simulations. Analysis of Somali Jet intensity changes from the multi-model ensemble results for the period 2005-2099 shows a weakened Somali Jet in the early 21st century (2010-2040), the strongest Somali Jet in the middle 21st century (2050-2060), as well as the weakest Somali Jet at the end of the 21st century (2070-2090). Compared with the period 1976-1999, the intensity of Somali Jet is weakening in general, and it becomes the weakest at the end of the 21st century. The results also suggest that the relationship between the intensity of Somali Jet in JJA and the increment of global mean surface air temperature is nonlinear, which is reflected differently among the models, suggesting the uncertainty of the IPCC-AR4 models. Considering the important role of Somali Jet in the Indian monsoon and East Asian monsoon and climate of China, the variability of Somali Jet and its evolvement under the present climate or future climate changes need to be further clarified.",1
"Environmental damage is one of the main justifications for continued efforts to reduce energy consumption and to shift to cleaner sources such as solar energy. In recent years there has been much progress in the analysis of environmental damages, in particular thanks to the Extern-E (External Costs of Energy) Project of the European Commission. This article presents a summary of the methodology and key results for the external costs of the major energy technologies. Even though the uncertainties are large, the results provide substantial evidence that the classical air pollutants (particles, No-x and SOz) from fossil fuels impose significant public health costs, comparable to the cost of global warming from CO2 emissions. The total external costs are relatively low for natural gas (in the range of about 0.5-1 eurocents/kWh for most EU countries), but much higher for coal and lignite (in the range of about 2-6 eurocents/kWh for most EU countries). By contrast, the external. costs of nuclear, wind, and photovoltaics are very low. The external costs of hydro are extremely variable from site to site, and the ones of biomass depend strongly on the specific technologies used and can be quite large for combustion.",1
"Evapotranspiration (ET) is likely to be greatly affected by global warming because of the dependence of ET on surface temperature. The increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases is expected to increase precipitation and evaporation proportionally. However, a few studies have shown a decreasing trend for evaporation over the last 50 years globally. In India, earlier works showed that there was a significant increasing temporal trend in surface temperature and a decreasing trend in grass reference ET (ETo). To study the temporal trend of ETo along with its regionwise spatial variation, 32 years (1971-2002) monthly meteorological data were collected for 133 selected stations evenly distributed over different agro-ecological regions (AERs) of India. ETo was estimated by the globally accepted Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Penman Monteith (PM) method (FAO-56 PM). These ETo values were then analyzed by a nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test (with modified effective sample size approach for serially correlated data) and Sen slope to determine the existence and magnitude of any statistically significant trend over the time period considered in this study. The same analysis was also performed on governing meteorological variables to identify the cause of existence of such trend in ETo. A significant decreasing trend was found in ETo all over India during the study period, which was mainly caused by a significant increase in the relative humidity and a consistent significant decrease in the wind speed throughout the country. However, a general increase in rainfall was not found in recent years.",1
"We examine the seasonal cycle of near-surface air temperature simulated by 17 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Nine of the models use ad hoc ""flux adjustment"" at the ocean surface to bring model simulations close to observations of the present-day climate. We group flux-adjusted and non-flux-adjusted models separately and examine the behaviol- of each class. When averaged over all of the flux-adjusted model simulations, near-surface air temperature falls within 2 K of observed values over the oceans. The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models shows errors up to similar to6 K in extensive ocean areas. Flux adjustments are not directly applied over land, and near-surface land temperature errors are substantial in the average over flux-adjusted models, which systematically underestimates (by similar to5 K) temperature in areas of elevated terrain. The corresponding average over non-flux-adjusted models forms a similar error pattern (with somewhat increased amplitude) over land. We use the temperature difference between July and January to measure seasonal cycle amplitude. Zonal means of this quantity from the individual flux-adjusted models form a fairly tight cluster (all within similar to 30% of the mean) centered on the observed values. The nonflux-adjusted models perform nearly as well at most latitudes. In Southern Ocean mid-latitudes, however, the non-flux-adjusted models overestimate the magnitude of January-minus-July temperature differences by similar to5 K due to an overestimate of summer (January) near-surface temperature. This error is common to five of the eight non-flux-adjusted models. Also, over Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude land areas, zonal mean differences between July and January temperatures simulated by the non-flux-adjusted models show a greater spread (positive and negative) about observed values than results from the flux-adjusted models. Elsewhere, differences between the two classes of models are less obvious. At no latitude is the zonal mean difference between averages over the two classes of models greater than the standard deviation over models. The ability of coupled GCMs to simulate a reasonable seasonal cycle is a necessary condition for confidence in their prediction of long-term climatic changes (such as global warming), but it is not a sufficient condition unless the seasonal cycle and long-term changes involve similar climatic processes. To test this possible connection, we compare seasonal cycle amplitude with equilibrium warming under doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide for the models in our data base. A small but positive correlation exists between these two quantities. This result is predicted by a simple conceptual model of the climate system, and it is consistent with other modeling experience, which indicates that the seasonal cycle depends only weakly on climate sensitivity.",1
"Background: As Earth warms, temperate and subpolar marine species will increasingly shift their geographic ranges poleward. The endemic shelf fauna of Antarctica is especially vulnerable to climate-mediated biological invasions because cold temperatures currently exclude the durophagous (shell-breaking) predators that structure shallow-benthic communities elsewhere. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used the Eocene fossil record from Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula, to project specifically how global warming will reorganize the nearshore benthos of Antarctica. A long-term cooling trend, which began with a sharp temperature drop similar to 41 Ma (million years ago), eliminated durophagous predators-teleosts (modern bony fish), decapod crustaceans (crabs and lobsters) and almost all neoselachian elasmobranchs (modern sharks and rays) from Antarctic nearshore waters after the Eocene. Even prior to those extinctions, durophagous predators became less active as coastal sea temperatures declined from 41 Ma to the end of the Eocene, similar to 33.5 Ma. In response, dense populations of suspension-feeding ophiuroids and crinoids abruptly appeared. Dense aggregations of brachiopods transcended the cooling event with no apparent change in predation pressure, nor were there changes in the frequency of shell-drilling predation on venerid bivalves. Conclusions/Significance: Rapid warming in the Southern Ocean is now removing the physiological barriers to shell-breaking predators, and crabs are returning to the Antarctic Peninsula. Over the coming decades to centuries, we predict a rapid reversal of the Eocene trends. Increasing predation will reduce or eliminate extant dense populations of suspension-feeding echinoderms from nearshore habitats along the Peninsula while brachiopods will continue to form large populations, and the intensity of shell-drilling predation on infaunal bivalves will not change appreciably. In time the ecological effects of global warming could spread to other portions of the Antarctic coast. The differential responses of faunal components will reduce the endemic character of Antarctic subtidal communities, homogenizing them with nearshore communities at lower latitudes.",1
"An inventory of biofuel combustion is used to develop estimates of the emissions of carbon-containing greenhouse gases (CO2, CO, CH4, and NMHC) in Asian countries. It is estimated that biofuels contributed 573 Tg-C (teragrams of carbon; 1 Tg = 10(12) g) in 1990, about 28% of the total carbon emissions from energy use in Asia. China (259 Tg-C) and India (187 Tg-C) were the largest emitting countries. The majority of the emissions, 504 Tg-C, were in the form of CO2; however, emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases were significant: 57 Tg-C as CO, 6.4 Tg-C as CH4, and 5.9 Tg-C as NMHC. Because of the high rates of incomplete combustion in typical biofuel stoves and cookers and the high global warming potentials (GWP) of the products of incomplete combustion (PICs), biofuels comprise an even larger share of energy-related emissions when measured in terms of total GWP (in CO2 equivalents): 38% over a 20-year time horizon and 31% over a 100-year time horizon. Even when the biofuel is assumed to be harvested on a completely sustainable basis tall CO2 emissions reabsorbed in the following growing season), PIC emissions from biofuel combustion account for 4.5% of the total carbon emissions and 23% of CO2 equivalents on a short-term (20-year) GWP basis.

"The Arctic climate is modulated, in part, by the presence of aerosols that affect the horizontal and vertical distribution of radiant energy passing through the atmosphere. Aerosols affect the surface-atmosphere radiation balance directly through interactions with solar and terrestrial radiation and indirectly through interactions with cloud particles. During summer 2004 forest fires destroyed vast areas of boreal forest in Alaska and western Canada, releasing smoke into the atmosphere. Smoke aerosol passing over instrumented field sites near Barrow, Alaska, was monitored to determine its physical and optical properties and its impact on the surface radiation budget. Empirical determinations of the direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) by the smoke were used to corroborate simulations made using the Moderate Resolution Transmittance radiative transfer model, MODTRAN (TM) 5. DARF is defined as the change in net shortwave irradiance per unit of aerosol optical depth (AOD). DARF, varying with solar angle and surface type, was evaluated at the surface, at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), and within the intervening layers of the atmosphere. The TOA results are compared with fluxes derived from coincident satellite retrievals made using the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiance data. Smoke tends to reduce the net shortwave irradiance at the surface while increasing it within layers in which it resides. Over the Arctic tundra during summer, a layer of smoke having AOD = 0.5 at 500 nm produces a diurnally averaged DARF of about -40 W m(-2) at the surface and -20 W m (-2) at TOA, while the layer itself tends to warm at a rate of approximate to 1 K d(-1). The tendency of smoke to cool the surface while heating the layer above may lead to increased atmospheric stability and suppress cloud formation. Radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere is especially sensitive to small changes in surface albedo, evidenced in both the model results and satellite retrievals. TOA net shortwave flux decreases when smoke is present over dark surfaces and tends to increase if the underlying surface is bright. For example, at solar noon during midsummer at Barrow, a layer of smoke having AOD(500) = 0.5 will reduce the net shortwave flux at TOA by approximate to 30 W m(-2) over the ocean while at the same time increasing it by 20 W m(-2) over an adjacent area of melting sea ice. For smoke aerosol, the sensitivity of DARF to changing surface albedo (assuming a solar zenith angle of 50 degrees) is about +15 W m(-2) AOD(-1) for every increase in surface albedo of 0.10. Throughout the Arctic summer, surface and TOA cooling and a tendency toward warming in the intervening atmospheric layers are the dominant radiative impacts of boreal smoke over the ocean and tundra areas, but the radiative forcing at TOA is positive over regions covered by ice or snow. Enhanced differential cooling/heating of ocean, ice, and snow due to the presence of smoke in the atmosphere may affect regional circulation patterns by perturbing diabatic processes. Should the frequency and intensity of boreal fires increase in the future because of global warming, the more persistent presence of smoke in the atmosphere may be manifest as a negative feedback at the surface. In addition, there will likely be indirect radiative impacts of the smoke as it influences cloudiness, which in turn further modulates the Arctic radiation budget.",1
"Biomass burning is an integral part of the Earth system, influencing and being influenced by global climate conditions, vegetation cover and human activity. Fire has long been associated with certain vegetation types and land uses in Southeast Asia, but has increasingly affected forests in Indonesia over the last 50 years or so, and peat swamp forests in particular during the last two to three decades. The role of humans, as igniters of fires and as contributors to the conditions that enable fires once ignited to spread widely, is discussed. Other factors, notably the involvement of anomalous climate conditions linked to variability in the Indian and Pacific oceans, are also considered. Global warming and changes in landuse could result in biomass burning becoming more frequent in the future, threatening biodiversity and human health and leading to positive feedbacks with climate change. Deliberate action is required to break a developing disequilibrium within the Earth system: incentives currently being considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at curbing climate change-causing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation could help mitigate biomass burning, while the effective management of biochar, a stable form of carbon produced from the incomplete combustion of organic matter, by farmers in Southeast Asia, and in other regions where biomass burning is common, could help in carbon sequestration. The paper concludes by stressing that in order to be effective any action needs to recognise the full range of environmental and human factors underpinning biomass burning.",1
"Atmospheric pollution is one of the worst threats to modern society. The consequences derived from different forms of atmospheric pollution vary from the local to the global scale, with deep impacts on climate, environment and human health. Several gaseous pollutants, even when present in trace concentrations, play a fundamental role in important processes that occur in atmosphere. Phenomena such as global warming, photochemical smog formation, acid rain and the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer are strongly related to the increased concentration of certain gaseous species in the atmosphere. The transport sector significantly produces atmospheric pollution, mainly when diesel oil is used as fuel. Therefore, new methodologies based on selective and sensitive gas detection schemes must be developed in order to detect and monitor pollutant gases from this source. In this work, CO(2) Laser Photoacoustic Spectroscopy was used to evaluate ethylene emissions and electrochemical analyzers were used to evaluate the emissions of CO, NO(x) and SO(2) from the exhaust of diesel powered vehicles (rural diesel with 5% of biodiesel, in this paper called only diesel) at different engine rotation speeds. Concentrations in the range 6 to 45 ppmV for ethylene, 109 to 1,231 ppmV for carbon monoxide, 75 to 868 ppmV for nitrogen oxides and 3 to 354 ppmV for sulfur dioxide were obtained. The results indicate that the detection techniques used were sufficiently selective and sensitive to detect the gaseous species mentioned above in the ppmV range.",1
"Methane is known to be one of the major greenhouse gases. On a global scale, livestock farming may contribute 18% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Though methane contribution is less than 2% of all the factors leading to global warming, it plays an important role because it is 21 times more effective than carbon dioxide. Methane emission is a direct result of the fermentation process performed by ruminal microorganisms and, in particular, the archael methanogens. Reducing methane emission would benefit both ruminant production and the environment. Methane generation can be reduced by electron-sink metabolic pathways to dispose of the reducing moieties. An alternative way for methane control in the rumen is to apply inhibitors against methanogens. Generating methane from manure has considerable merit because it appears to offer at least a partial solution to two pressing problems-environmental crisis and energy shortage. An obvious benefit from methane production is the energy value of the gas itself. Control of methane emission by rumen microbes in Korea has mainly been focused on application of various chemicals, such as BES and PMDI, that inhibit the growth and activity of methanogens in the rumen. Alternatives were to apply long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and oils with or without organic acids (malate and fumarate). The results for trials with methane reducing agents and the situation of biogas production industries and a typical biogas plant in Korea will be introduced here.

"To examine the effects of a doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration and other aspects of global climate change on a common CAM species native to the Sonoran Desert, Agave deserti was grown under 370 and 750 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) air and gas exchange was measured under various environmental conditions. Doubling the CO2 concentration increased daily net CO2 uptake by 49% throughout the 17 months and decreased daily transpiration by 24%, leading to a 110% increase in water-use efficiency, Under the doubled CO2 concentration, the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was 11% lower, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was 34% lower, and the activated:total ratio for Rubisco was 25% greater than under the current CO2 concentration. Less leaf epicuticular wax occurred on plants under the doubled CO2 concentration, which decreased the reflectance of photosynthetic photon flux (PPF); the chlorophyll content per unit leaf area was also less, The enhancement of daily net CO2 uptake by doubling the CO2 concentration increased when the PPF was decreased below 25 mol m(-2) d(-1), when water was withheld, and when day/night temperatures were below 17/12 degrees C, More leaves, each with a greater surface area, were produced per plant under the doubled CO2 concentration. The combination of increased total leaf surface area and increased daily net CO2 uptake led to an 88% stimulation of dry mass accumulation under the doubled CO2 concentration, A rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, together with accompanying changes in temperature, precipitation, and PPF, should increase growth and productivity of native populations of A. deserti.",1
"Improving eco-efficiency is propitious for saving resources and reducing emissions, and has become a popular route to sustainable development. We define two energy-related eco-efficiencies: energy efficiency (ENE) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-related eco-efficiency (GEE) using energy consumption and the associated GHG emissions as the environmental impacts. Using statistical data, we analyze China's energy consumption and GHG emissions by industrial subsystem and sector, and estimate the ENE and GEE values for China in 2007 as 4.871x10(7) US$/PJ and 4.26x10(8) US$/TgCO(2)eq, respectively. Industry is the primary contributing subsystem of China's economy, contributing 45.2% to the total economic production, using 79.6% of the energy consumed, and generating 94% of the total GHG emissions. We distinguish the individual contributions of the 39 industrial sectors to the national economy, overall energy consumption, and GHG emissions, and estimate their energyrelated eco-efficiencies. The results show that although ferrous metal production contributes only 3.5% to the national industrial economy, it consumes the most industrial energy (20% of total), contributes 16% to the total industrial global warming potential (GWP), and ranks third in GHG emissions. The power and heat sector ranks first in GHG emissions and contributes one-third of the total industrial GWP, although it only consumes about 8% of total industrial energy and, like ferrous metal production, contributes 3.5% to the national economy. The ENE of the ferrous metal and power and heat sectors are only 8 and 2.1x10(7) US$/PJ, while the GEE for these two sectors are 9 and 4x10(4) US$/GgCO(2)eq, respectively; these are nearly the lowest ENE and GEE values among all 39 industry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of ecoefficiency improvement through a comparison with other countries.",1
"Inclusion of the effects of vegetation feedback in a global climate change simulation suggests that the vegetation-climate feedback works to alleviate partially the summer surface warming and the associated heat waves over Europe induced by the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The projected warming of 4A degrees C over most of Europe with static vegetation has been reduced by 1A degrees C as the dynamic vegetation feedback effects are included.. Examination of the simulated surface energy fluxes suggests that additional greening in the presence of vegetation feedback effects enhances evapotranspiration and precipitation, thereby limiting the warming, particularly in the daily maximum temperature. The greening also tends to reduce the frequency and duration of heat waves. Results in this study strongly suggest that the inclusion of vegetation feedback within climate models is a crucial factor for improving the projection of warm season temperatures and heat waves over Europe.",1
"Flowering is a critical stage in plant life cycles, and changes might alter processes at the species, community and ecosystem levels. Therefore, likely flowering-time responses to global change drivers are needed for predictions of global change impacts on natural and managed ecosystems. Here, the impact of elevated atmospheric CO(2) concentration ([CO(2)]) (550 mu mol mol(-1)) and warming (+2 degrees C) is reported on flowering times in a native, species-rich, temperate grassland in Tasmania, Australia in both 2004 and 2005. Elevated [CO(2)] did not affect average time of first flowering in either year, only affecting three out of 23 species. Warming reduced time to first flowering by an average of 19.1 d in 2004, acting on most species, but did not significantly alter flowering time in 2005, which might be related to the timing of rainfall. Elevated [CO(2)] and warming treatments did not interact on flowering time. These results show elevated [CO(2)] did not alter average flowering time or duration in this grassland; neither did it alter the response to warming. Therefore, flowering phenology appears insensitive to increasing [CO(2)] in this ecosystem, although the response to warming varies between years but can be strong.",1
"Purpose Climate factors, considered significant factors in regulating soil organic carbon (SOC), are not equally important at all spatial scales. However, the scale which provides the optimal relationship between climate and SOC and how that relationship varies at multiple scales are still unclear. Thus, it is crucial to study the relationship between climate factors and SOC at multiple scales when attempting to accurately predict the SOC pool and evaluate the influence of climate change on global carbon cycling. The objective of this research is to examine the scale effect of climate factors on SOC content in the Uplands of Northeast China. Materials and methods The relationship between climate factors and SOC content at the regional, provincial, city, and county scales was evaluated at 0-20 and 0-100 cm using correlation and regression analysis. Data for the study in the Uplands of Northeast China were examined using 1,022 profiles obtained from the Second National Soil Survey of China. A nested sampling scheme was adopted at four scales for this research. Results and discussion Differences exist in the degree of correlation and relative importance of temperature and precipitation at different scales. Temperature is the main climate factor controlling SOC content at the regional scale. At the provincial scale, temperature is also the main climate factor controlling SOC content in the Uplands of Heilongjiang and Eastern Inner Mongolia. SOC content in Jilin and Liaoning is influenced jointly by temperature and precipitation. Additionally, obvious regional differences occurred in the relationship between climate factors and SOC content at the provincial scale. Although this scale differs from those by other researchers, similar results have been reported in China, Spain, and the USA. The reasons might be attributed to the differences in soil type, ecosystem, and topographic position. At both the city and county scales, weak or no relation was observed between climate factors and SOC content. Climate factors have limited ability to explain SOC content variability given that SOC is affected by multiple factors which were not taken into account by this research. Therefore, multiple scales should be considered when the feedback relationship between global climate change and SOC content is studied. Conclusions The relationship between climate factors and SOC content weakens with decreasing scale, especially from the provincial to city scale. The main climate factors controlling SOC content vary with different scales. The provincial scale is optimal for studying the relationship between climate factors and SOC content in the Uplands of Northeast China. Seasonal change of temperature and precipitation may also influence SOC. Thus, it is necessary to consider climate factors at multiple timescales. Moreover, further studies focusing on the scale effect of other factors (including climate) on SOC content variability will be carried out at different scales to determine the main factors controlling SOC content.",1
"Global warming is said to be caused by the build up of active greenhouse gases in our atmosphere and carbon dioxide - released on the combustion of fossil fuels is thought to be the most important of these. Agricultural crops, grown specifically for use as a fuel source, might play an important role in reducing our consumption of fossil fuel sources through substitution. However, in order to fully qualify as a ''beneficial crop'' it must be clearly shown that production entails a net benefit in terms of energy output to energy input i.e.; it has a positive energy balance. This paper considers the difficulties in assessing both carbon and energy budgeting. It describes a recently developed computer model which attempts to define the energy and carbon inputs and outputs of the leading UK energy crop, that is of short rotation coppice (SRC). Preliminary results show that SRC, when displacing fossil fuel, has a very positive energy yield with the added benefit of carbon saving in terms of offset emissions. The computer model takes account of direct and indirect energy and carbon inputs to the crop, allowing the model user to determine the sensitivity of individual cropping operations including establishment, fencing, harvesting operations, rotation and cutting cycle variations, the impact of field size, transport distance from the farm to the point of utilisation, the energy cost of storage and drying. Each management decision influences the final energy or carbon ratio of the SRC crop. Such complexity makes a definitive statement on the energy/carbon ratio for crop production difficult, however if a standard management system is adopted (as described later) the energy ratio of growing SRC for fuel may be assigned. In the case examined here a ratio of 30 : 1 (energy units produced : used) is reported. However, this ratio is sensitive to variation in crop yield and management efficiency and so, although the ratio is positive, this should not encourage a wasteful attitude to crop management systems. In terms of carbon balances, the most important consideration is the substitution value of the material in relation to fossil fuels. In this paper, figures presented refer to wood substituted for coal use and pertain to a field area of 1 hectare (ha). If field size is increased up to 3ha, then the energy and carbon ratios improve by approximately 15%.",1
"Scientific experts have confirmed that anthropogenic warming is underway, and some degree of adaptation is now unavoidable. However, the details of impacts on the scale of climate change at which humans would have to prepare for and adjust to them are still the subject of considerable research, inquiry, and debate. Planning for adaptation requires information on the scale over which human organizations and institutions have authority and capacity, yet the general circulation models lack forecasting skill at these scales, and attempts to ""downscale"" climate models are still in the early stages of development. Because we do not know what adaptations will be required, we cannot say whether they will be harder or easier-more expensive or less-than emissions control. Whatever improvements in regional predictive capacity may come about in the future, the lack of current predictive capacity on the relevant scale is a strong argument for why we must both control greenhouse gas emissions and prepare to adapt.",1
"Global warming is expected to occur due to carbon dioxide and other gases emitted in the course of human activities. Due to uncertainties about atmospheric chemistry, few attempts have been made to quantify the impact of emissions of NO(x), non-methane hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Atmospheric chemistry modelling at Harwell Laboratory has resulted in preliminary estimates of the impact of trace gases including NO(x), many hydrocarbon species, carbon monoxide and water vapour on global warming. These estimates have been applied to emissions from transport, with particular attention to cars. It is found that the use of three-way catalysts on cars could reduce their global warming impact. IDI diesel engines have still less global warming impact. High NO(x), CO and hydrocarbon emissions from DI diesels could result in a higher impact from these engines than from IDI diesels. Emissions from air-craft are injected into the troposphere at the height where they have a maximal effect on global warming. Although modelling of aircraft impact is at a very early stage, the first results indicate that air travel could become an important cause of global warming.",1
"At prevailing economic practice the alarming ""two degrees-limit"" of global warming will be reached long before the known fossil fuel reserves are gone. A future alternative energy economy relying on renewable energies will be more diverse yet more expensive than traditional combustion the new figure of merit is the cost of CO(2) avoidance. This communication surveys the relevant alternatives - solar energy in its various manifestations, geothermal and tidal energy - and assesses their current contribution to the over-all energy supply, revealing a deplorable lag between renewable capability and the needs of climate conservation. Nuclear energy is seen as low-CO(2) bridging technology between the fossil period and the age of renewables; being restrained in Germany in favor of subsidizing alternative energies, the German experience with renewables is drawn upon in this survey. Thermodynamics teaches: Energy can be transferred from one system to another, as from sun to earth. It can be transformed from one form into another, as from light to electricity. Energy can not be produced nor destroyed nor renewed. The term ""Renewable Energy"" is applied to energy derived from our surrounding for human use. Renewable energies will have to replace fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - for two reasons: If we continue to burn them, reserves will be exhausted before long; emission of carbon dioxide is about to change our climate by the so-called green house effect.",1
"Crop heat units (CHU) are commonly used to rate suitability of corn (Zea mays L.) hybrids and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] varieties for production in various regions of Canada. The CHU map presently in use for the Maritime provinces is based on climate data from the period 1956 to 1985. This paper presents an updated CHU map for the region using the latest available climate normals (1971 to 2000) and up-to-date interpolation and mapping procedures. Decadal time trends of CHU and water deficits are also examined for seven selected climate stations in the region. Average CHU ratings often increased by 100 units or more for the most recent period, with some exceptions. Station decadal trends from 1955 to 2004 confirmed the warming trend, with an average increase of 86 CHU per decade. Increased CHU have promoted higher potential yields in corn and soybean in the region, although this potential was not likely met during the last decade due to frequent droughts in some areas. However, there is presently little evidence to suggest that higher yield potential will be significantly limited by changing water deficits as a result of greenhouse-gas induced global warming in this century.",1
"The community of climatologists predicts a progressive global warming [IPCC Fourth Assessment Report-Climate Change, 2007. The Scientific Basis. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge] that will not be interrupted by a glacial inception for the next 50 ka [Berger and Loutre, 2002. An exceptionally long Interglacial ahead? Science 297, 1287-1288]. These predictions are based on continuously increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and on the orbital forcing that will provide only muted insolation variations for the next 50 ka. To assess the potential climate development without human interference, we analyse climate proxy records from Europe and the North Atlantic of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (423-362 ka BP), an interval when insolation. variations show a strong linear correlation with those of the recent past and the future. This analysis suggests that the insolation minimum at 397 ka BP, which provides the best available analogue to the present insolation minimum, terminated interglacial conditions in Europe. At that time, tundra-steppe vegetation spread in Central Europe and pine forests dominated in the eastern Mediterranean region. Because the intensities of the 397 ka BP and present insolation minima are very similar, we conclude that under natural boundary conditions the present insolation minimum holds the potential to terminate the Holocene interglacial. Our findings support the Ruddiman hypothesis [Ruddiman, W., 2003. The Anthropogenic Greenhouse Era began thousands of years ago. Climate Change 61, 261-293], which proposes that early anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission prevented the inception of a glacial that would otherwise already have started. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"To understand inter-model differences in long-term simulations of climate change, as exist between coupled atmosphere/ocean general circulation models, it is necessary to first understand climate feedback mechanisms that operate within each of the various models. With this goal in mind, we have employed an 1870 to 1989 simulation, with prescribed increases in greenhouse gases, that was performed using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version 1, as a vehicle for determining two feedback processes operating within that model. These are cloud feedback and snow/ice albedo feedback. A prerequisite to evaluating feedback mechanisms is to first evaluate the direct radiative forcing, caused by the increasing greenhouse gases, which produces global warming by the model, and a procedure for doing this is presented. Cloud feedback is then evaluated by referencing the model's change in global-mean cloud-radiative forcing to the direct greenhouse-gas induced radiative forcing, and a comparable procedure is employed to determine snow/ice albedo feedback. This model produces a moderately strong negative cloud feedback and a modest positive snow/ice albedo feedback. But the main purpose of this study is to provide a reasonably simple procedure for determining both cloud feedback and snow/ice albedo feedback within coupled atmosphere/ocean GCMs.",1
"In our research group, an atmospheric multigas inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source was developed for industrial plasma processing and elemental analysis. The plasma source can stably generate atmospheric thermal plasma not only by Ar but also by He, O(2), N(2), CO(2), air, and their mixture gas. In this paper, the plasma source was applied for anesthetic gas decomposition including N(2)O, which is a kind of global warming gases. Atmospheric thermal plasma was generated by mixture gas of N(2)O, O(2), and air. It corresponds to actual gas composition for up to three surgery exhaust. Spectroscopic characteristics of generated plasma and composition of treated gas were investigated. By using optimally shaped ICP torch, 99.9% of decomposition rate and 942 g/kWh of high energy efficiency were achieved. However, around 3% of NO(x) was generated as by-products due to high gas temperature.",1
"In this study, we examine the influence of ice dynamics and the sub-grid-scale ice thickness distribution on present-day and climate change simulations in a global coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere model of intermediate complexity. Under present-day conditions the sea-ice physics modifies both the annual mean and seasonal variation of ice-ocean-atmosphere conditions. In models with motionless sea ice, the ice volume increases and undergoes a smaller seasonal cycle. Resolving the ice thickness distribution also increases the ice thickness, but enhances the seasonal cycle. The response of the system to increased atmospheric CO2 forcing is also dependent on the sea ice physics. Simulating ice dynamics and the ice thickness distribution enhances the ice area response. However, the ice volume response is diminished when ice dynamics is included and enhanced when the ice thickness distribution is resolved. The oceanic thermohaline circulation and regional air temperature response to global warming is also dependent on the sea ice parameterizations. Additional simulations were performed to quantify the influence of the albedo feedback mechanism on climate change simulations. When the albedo feedback was inactive, amplified warming was still present (although reduced) at high latitudes due to the poleward retrcat of the ice cover and larger ocean-atmosphere heat exchange. In these simulations, the albedo feedback accounted for 17% of the global air temperature increase and over 30% of the Northern Hemisphere ice area and volume decrease.",1
"Montane butterfly densities and species assemblages vary widely over space and through time. This variation is partially driven by variation in weather and climate, at spatial scales ranging from local habitats to regional ecosystems, and over time spans of days to centuries. We present case studies that illustrate how climatic variation affects individuals, population densities and species' ranges, and species distribution patterns at the regional level. Present patterns at all scales are neither spatially nor temporally static, even in the absence of directional anthropogenic climate change. The observed patterns allow us to sketch the broad outline of expected changes in population densites, species distributions and butterfly community composition under anthropogenic climate change. We conclude that the fragmented habitats found in montainous areas will exacerbate the effects of climate change on population densities and species' survival, and that relatively sedentary species require closer attention from conservation biologists.",1
"Automotive air-conditioning (A/C) or mobile air-conditioning (MAC) systems have played an important role in human comfort and to some extent in human safety during vehicle driving in varied atmospheric conditions. It has become an essential part of the vehicles of all categories worldwide. After discussing the basic operation of the A/C system, a brief summary is provided on historical development of the vehicular A/C system, with refrigerant history from the inception of the A/C system to future systems: R12, R134a, and enhanced R134a A/C system, and next-generation refrigerants having no ozone depletion potential in the stratosphere and global warming potential less than 150. The discussion also includes an enhanced MAC system with R134a, and the direct and indirect emissions from vehicles impacting global warming due to the use of the A/C system. This would explain why we continue to change the refrigerants in the automotive A/C system in spite of billions of dollars of cost for the previous refrigerant change (from R12 to R134a). The system design considerations are then outlined for minimizing the impact of A/C operation on the vehicle fuel consumption. Finally, new concepts of design of A/C system and vehicle heat load reduction ideas are discussed to further minimize the impact of A/C system operation on the environment without impacting human comfort. It is anticipated that this article will provide the overall and detailed prospective of the A/C system developments and provide an opportunity to the researchers to accelerate research and development for the refrigerant changeover and A/C system and component optimization and cost reduction.",1
"Several scenario experiments of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4) are performed by version g0 of a Flexible coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model (FGOALS) developed at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP/CAS), including the ""Climate of the 20th century experiment"", ""CO(2) 1% increase per year to doubling experiment"" and two separate IPCC greenhouse gases emission scenarios A1B and B1 experiments. To distinguish between the different impacts of natural variations and human activities on the climate change, three-member ensemble runs are performed for each scenario experiment. The coupled model simulations show: (1) from 1900 to 2000, the global mean temperature increases about 0.5 degrees C and the major increase occurs during the later half of the 20th century, which is in consistent with the observations that highlights the coupled model's ability to reproduce the climate changes since the industrial revolution; (2) the global mean surface air temperature increases about 16 degrees C in the CO(2) doubling experiment and 5 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C in the A1B and B1 scenarios, respectively. The global warming is indicated by not only the changes of the surface temperature and precipitation but also the temperature increase in the deep ocean. The thermal expansion of the sea water would induce the rise of the global mean sea level. Both the control run and the 20th century climate change run are carried out again with version g1 of FGOALS, in which the cold biases in the high latitudes were removed. They are then compared with those from version g0 of FGOALS in order to distinguish the effect of the model biases on the simulation of global warming.",1
"Urbanisation is estimated to result in 6 billion urban dwellers by 2050. Cities will be exposed to climate change from greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing, and localised effects from urbanisation such as the urban heat island. An urban land-surface model has been included in the HadAM3 Global Climate Model. It shows that regions of high population growth coincide with regions of high urban heat island potential, most notably in the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent, and East Africa. Climate change has the capacity to modify the climatic potential for urban heat islands, with increases of 30% in some locations, but a global average reduction of 6%. Warming and extreme heat events due to urbanisation and increased energy consumption are simulated to be as large as the impact of doubled CO(2) in some regions, and climate change increases the disparity in extreme hot nights between rural and urban areas.

"In addition to available country or site-specific life cycle studies on Jatropha biodiesel we present a generic, location-independent life cycle assessment and provide a general but in-depth analysis of the environmental performance of Jatropha biodiesel for transportation. Additionally, we assess the influence of changes in byproduct use and production chain. In our assessments, we went beyond the impact on energy requirement and global warming by including impacts on ozone layer and terrestrial acidification and eutrophication. The basic Jatropha biodiesel system consumes eight times less nonrenewable energy than conventional diesel and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 51%. This result coincides with the lower limit of the range of reduction percentages available in literature for this system and for other liquid biofuels. The impact on the ozone layer is also lower than that provoked by fossil diesel, although eutrophication and acidification increase eight times. This study investigates the general impact trends of the Jatropha system, although not considering land-use change. The results are useful as a benchmark against which other biodiesel systems can be evaluated, to calculate repayment times for land-use change induced carbon loss or as guideline with default values for assessing the environmental performance of specific variants of the system.",1
"We have investigated the physical characteristics of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to assess which properties are most important in determining the efficiency of a GHG. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), nitrogen fluorides, and various other known atmospheric trace molecules have been included in this study. Compounds containing the halogens F or Cl have in common very polar X-F or X-Cl bonds, particularly the X-F bonds. It is shown that as more F atoms bond to the same central atom the bond dipoles become larger as a result of the central atom becoming more positive. This leads to a linear increase in the total or integrated X-F bond dipole derivatives for the molecule, which leads to a nonlinear (quadratic) increase in infrared (IR) intensity. Moreover, virtually all of the X-F bond stretches occur in the atmospheric IR window as opposed to X-H stretches, which do not occur in the atmospheric window. It is concluded that molecules possessing several F atoms will always have a large radiative forcing parameter in the calculation of their global warming potential. Some of the implications for global warming and climate change are discussed.",1
"Mitigating global climate change requires not only government action but also cooperation from consumers. Population-based, cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1202 respondents in Portland OR and Houston TX between June and September 2007 regarding awareness, concern, and behavior change related to climate change. The data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Awareness about climate change is virtually universal (98% in Portland and 92% in Houston) with the vast majority reporting some level of concern (90% in Portland and 82% in Houston). A multivariate analysis revealed significant predictors of behavior change: individuals with heightened concern about climate change (p < 0.001); respondents with higher level of education (p = 0.03); younger compared with older individuals (p < 0.001); and Portlanders more likely to change behavior compared with Houstonians (p < 0.001). Of those who changed behavior, 43% reported having reduced their energy usage at home, 39% had reduced gasoline consumption, and 26% engaged in other behaviors, largely recycling. Qualitative data indicate a number of cognitive, behavioral, and structural obstacles to voluntary mitigation. Although consumers are interested in global climate change-mitigation strategies and willing to act accordingly, considerable impediments remain. Government policy must eliminate economic, structural, and social barriers to change and advance accessible and economical alternatives. Individual-level mitigation can be a policy option under favorable contextual conditions, as these results indicate, but must be accompanied by mitigation efforts from industry, commerce, and government.",1
"The possibility of global climate change due to the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases poses dangers of a magnitude which is imprecisely known but may be very large. The problem can be ameliorated by reducing fossil fuel consumption through conservation and expanded use of nuclear and solar power. In particular, major reductions can be achieved if fossil fuels are replaced in electricity generation and if electricity assumes a larger role in the overall energy economy.",1
"Given current international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit human-induced global-mean near-surface temperature increases to 2A degrees C, relative to the pre-industrial era, we seek to determine the impact such a temperature increase might have upon the frequency of seasonal-mean temperature extremes; further we seek to determine what global-mean temperature increase would prevent extreme temperature values from becoming the norm. Results indicate that given a 2A degrees C global mean temperature increase it is expected that for 70-80% of the land surface maximum seasonal-mean temperatures will exceed historical extremes (as determined from the 95th percentile threshold value over the second half of the 20th Century) in at least half of all years, i.e. the current historical extreme values will effectively become the norm. Many regions of the globe-including much of Africa, the southeastern and central portions of Asia, Indonesia, and the Amazon-will reach this point given the ""committed"" future global-mean temperature increase of 0.6A degrees C (4A degrees C relative to the pre-industrial era) and 50% of the land surface will reach it given a future global-mean temperature increase of between 0.8 and 0.95A degrees C (6-75A degrees C relative to the pre-industrial era). These results suggest substantial fractions of the globe could experience seasonal-mean temperature extremes with high regularity, even if the global-mean temperature increase remains below the 2A degrees C target.",1
"Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the fossil energy benefits and avoided global warming emissions have been evaluated for the EU Biofuels goals in Spain. The Biofuels considered are cereal ethanol, biodiesel from residual oils, and from palm, sunflower, soybeans and rapeseed vegetable oils. Our findings are that the source of the cereal and vegetable oil influences the efficacy of the Biofuels and that results greatly depend on whether or not electricity has been produced as co-product in bioethanol plants and that without CHP the energy balance of ethanol is negative with few greenhouse gas offsets.

"Both theoretical ecology and lake management practices acutely need quantitative assessment tools for the analysis of structural changes taking place in the plankton community. Size spectrum, a tool allowing such assessment, is usually based on size distributions of organisms irrespective of their taxonomy. The size-frequency distribution of taxonomic units in an assemblage, named by us 'traditional taxonomic size spectrum' (TTSS), has been applied for over 70 years, but seldom in aquatic ecology. Longterm consistency of phytoplankton TTSS, evidenced even during pronounced ecosystem changes, was described for the subtropical and eutrophic Lake Kinneret, Israel. In the present study, we examine whether consistent TTSS patterns prevail across ecosystems, and apply the TTSS to the phytoplankton of the temperate and oligotrophic Lake Tahoe, USA. A typical annual TTSS pattern was revealed, and its details were analyzed quantitatively by hierarchical cluster analysis. The Tahoe TTSS similarity level during 4 years (Pearson r=0.92 to 0.99) is comparable to that of the Kinneret during its stable period; even for pairs divided by > 20 years, r > 0.8. While the Tahoe TTSS general pattern resembles that of Lake Kinneret, the two lakes are distinguishable by means of cluster analysis. A high similarity (r=0.91) was found between the eight-year averaged TTSSs of the two lakes. The above results let us suppose that the longterm consistency of the aquatic assemblage taxonomic size structure pattern is a general phenomenon. This pattern deserves special attention at times of accelerated global climate change, acerbated by burgeoning anthropogenic impacts.",1
"Future warming is predicted to shift the Earth system into a mode with progressive increase and vigour of extreme climate events possibly stimulating other mechanisms that invigorate global warming. This study provides new data and modelling investigating climatic consequences and biogeochemical feedbacks that happened in a warmer world similar to 112 Myr ago. Our study focuses on the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) lb and explores how the Earth system responded to a moderate similar to 25,000 yr lasting climate perturbation that is modelled to be less than 1 degrees C in global average temperature. Using a new chronological model for OAE lb we present high-resolution elemental and bulk carbon isotope records from DSDP Site 545 from Mazagan Plateau off NW Africa and combine this information with a coupled atmosphere-land-ocean model. The simulations suggest that a perturbation at the onset of OAE lb caused almost instantaneous warming of the atmosphere on the order of 0.3 degrees C followed by a longer (similar to 45,000 yr) period of similar to 0.8 degrees C cooling. The marine records from DSDP Site 545 support that these moderate swings in global climate had immediate consequences for African continental supply of mineral matter and nutrients (phosphorous), subsequent oxygen availability, and organic carbon burial in the eastern subtropical Atlantic, however, without turning the ocean anoxic. The match between modelling results and stratigraphic isotopic data support previous studies [summarized in Jenkyns, H.C., 2003. Evidence for rapid climate change in the Mesozoic-Palaeogene greenhouse world. The Royal Society, 361: 1885-1916.] in that methane emission from marine hydrates, albeit moderate in dimension, may have been the trigger for OAE 1b, though we can not finally rule out alternative mechanisms. Following the hydrate mechanism a total of 15-10(18) g methane carbon (delta C-13 = - 60 parts per thousand), equivalent to about 10% to the total modem gas hydrate inventory, generated the delta C-13(carb) profile recorded in the section. Modelling suggests a combination of moderate-scale methane pulses supplemented by continuous methane emission at elevated levels over similar to 25,000 yr. The proposed mechanism, though difficult to finally confirm in the geological past, is arguably more likely to occur in a warmer world and apparently perturbs global climate and ocean chemistry almost instantaneously. This study shows that, once set-off, this mechanism can maintain Earth's climate in a perturbed mode over geological time leading to pronounced changes in regional climate. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Climatic changes over the Mediterranean basin in 2031-2060, when a 2 degrees C global warming is most likely to occur, are investigated with the HadCM3 global circulation model and their impacts on human activities and natural ecosystem are assessed. Precipitation and surface temperature changes are examined through mean and extreme values analysis, under the A2 and B2 emission scenarios. Confidence in results is obtained via bootstrapping. Over the land areas, the warming is larger than the global average. The rate of warming is found to be around 2 degrees C in spring and winter, while it reaches 4 degrees C in summer. An additional month of summer days is expected, along with 2-4 weeks of tropical nights. Increase in hearwave days and decrease in frost nights are expected to be a month inland. In the northern part of the basin the widespread drop in summer rainfall is partially compensated by a winter precipitation increase. One to 3 weeks of additional dry days lead to a dry season lengthened by a week and shifted toward spring in the south of France and inland Algeria, and autumn elsewhere. In central Mediterranean droughts are extended by a month, starting a week earlier and ending 3 weeks later. The impacts of these climatic changes on human activities such as agriculture, energy, tourism and natural ecosystems (forest fires) are also assessed. Regarding agriculture, crops whose growing cycle occurs mostly in autumn and winter show no changes or even an increase in yield. In contrast, summer crops show a remarkable decrease of yield. This different pattern is attributed to a lengthier drought period during summer and to an increased rainfall in winter and autumn. Regarding forest fire risk, an additional month of risk is expected over a great part of the basin. Energy demand levels are expected to fall significantly during a warmer winter period inland, whereas they seem to substantially increase nearly everywhere during summer. Extremely high summer temperatures in the Mediterranean, coupled with improved climate conditions in northern Europe, may lead to a gradual decrease in summer tourism in the Mediterranean, but an increase in spring and autumn.

"Enhanced release of CO2 to the atmosphere from soil organic carbon as a result of increased temperatures may lead to a positive feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle, resulting in much higher CO2 levels and accelerated global warming. However, the magnitude of this effect is uncertain and critically dependent on how the decomposition of soil organic C (heterotrophic respiration) responds to changes in climate. Previous studies with the Hadley Centre's coupled climate-carbon cycle general circulation model (GCM) (HadCM3LC) used a simple, single-pool soil carbon model to simulate the response. Here we present results from numerical simulations that use the more sophisticated 'RothC' multipool soil carbon model, driven with the same climate data. The results show strong similarities in the behaviour of the two models, although RothC tends to simulate slightly smaller changes in global soil carbon stocks for the same forcing. RothC simulates global soil carbon stocks decreasing by 54 Gt C by 2100 in a climate change simulation compared with an 80 Gt C decrease in HadCM3LC. The multipool carbon dynamics of RothC cause it to exhibit a slower magnitude of transient response to both increased organic carbon inputs and changes in climate. We conclude that the projection of a positive feedback between climate and carbon cycle is robust, but the magnitude of the feedback is dependent on the structure of the soil carbon model.",1
"This paper compares both the main physical options and the principal policy instruments to realize a deep cut in carbon dioxide emissions necessary to control global climate change. A top-down energy-economy model is used that has three emission reduction options: energy savings, a transition towards less-carbon-intensive or non-carbon energy resources, and the use of carbon dioxide capture and storage technology. Five policy instruments - carbon taxes, fossil fuel taxes, non-carbon (renewable) energy subsidies, a portfolio standard for the carbon intensity of energy production, and a portfolio standard for the use of non-carbon (renewable) energy resources - are compared in terms of costs, efficiency and their impact on the composition of the energy supply system. One of our main conclusions is that a carbon intensity portfolio standard, involving the recycling of carbon taxes to support renewables deployment, is the most cost-efficient way to address the problem of global climate change. A comprehensive introduction of the capture and storage of carbon dioxide would contribute to reducing the costs of climate change control, but would not obviate the large-scale need for renewables.",1
"The climatic impact of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is calculated annually for the period 1900-2100, using a globally averaged computer model. Emissions of N2O have been increasing up to an estimated 12.7 Tg N/year in 1990 by human activities and global warming. If the current trends continue, emissions are estimated to be 25.7 Tg N/year by 2100, with fossil fuel use and human food production as major contributors. The resulting equilibrium temperature increase, 0.37-degrees-C, exceeds the forcing derived from climate goals that may be considered environmentally desirable. Limiting equilibrium warming to 0.1-degrees-C per decade would require anthropogenic-induced and warming-induced N2O emissions to be reduced by 80% relative to current trends and to be stabilised from 2050, so that 10.7 Tg N/year is emitted by 2100. To stabilise the current concentration or climate forcing of N2O, substantially larger cuts are needed. However, even in an optimistic scenario emissions keep increasing up to 14.4 Tg N/year by 2100. A major reason is the close connection between N2O emissions and human food production. Synthetic fertiliser use, land-use change and production of manure increase almost inevitably as the human population grows. Thus if global warming is to be limited to 0.1-degrees-C per decade it may be necessary to set emission reductions for other greenhouse gases relatively high to compensate for growth in climatic forcing by N2O.",1
"The global warming resulting from increased CO2 is addressed in the context of two regional processes that contribute to climate change in coupled climate models, the ""El Nino-like"" response (slackening of the equatorial Pacific SST gradient) and sea-ice response at high latitudes. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Climate System Model (CSM) response is compared with results from a coupled model that produces comparatively greater global warming, the NCAR U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) global coupled model. In an experiment where atmospheric CO2 is increased 1% yr(-1) compound, globally averaged surface air temperature increase near the time of CO2 doubling for the CSM is 43 degrees C (3.50 degrees C for the DOE model). Analysis of a simple coupled model shows the CSM equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 is comparable to that from the slab ocean version (about 2.1 degrees C). One process that contributes to global warming (estimated to be about 5% in one slab ocean model), as well as to significant Pacific region climate effects, is the El Nino-like response. It is a notable feature in the DOE model and some other global coupled models but does not occur in the CSM. The authors show that cloud responses are a major determining factor. With increased CO2, there are negative net cloud-forcing differences in the western equatorial Pacific in the CSM and DOE models, but large positive differences in the DOE model and negative differences in the CSM in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This produces asymmetric cloud radiative forcing contributing to an El Nino-like response in the DOE model and not in the CSM. To remove the amplifying effects of ocean dynamics and to identify possible parameter-dependent processes that could contribute to such cloud forcing changes, the authors analyze slab ocean versions of the coupled models in comparison with a slab ocean configuration of the atmospheric model in the CSM [Community Climate Model Version 3 (CCM3)] that includes prognostic cloud liquid water. The latter shows a change in sign (from negative to positive) of the net cloud forcing in the eastern equatorial Pacific with doubled CO2, similar to the DOE model, in comparison with the CCM3 version with diagnostic cloud liquid water. Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (prescribed SST) experiments show that ail three atmospheric models (DOE, CCM3 with diagnostic cloud liquid water, and CCM3 with prognostic cloud liquid water) perform poorly relative to observations in terms of cloud radiative forcing, though CCM3 with prognostic cloud liquid water is slightly superior to the others. Another process that contributes to climate response to increasing CO2 is sea-ice changes, which are estimated to enhance global warming by roughly 20% in the CSM and 37% in the DOE model. Sea-ice retreat with increasing CO2 in the CSM is less than in the DOE model in spite df identical sea-ice formulations. Results from the North Atlantic and Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian (GIN) Sea region show that the surface energy budget response is controlled primarily by surface albedo (related to ice area changes) and cloud changes. However, a more important factor is the poleward ocean heat transport associated with changes in meridional overturning in the GIN Sea. With increased CO2, the transport of warmer water from the south into this region in the DOE model is greater in comparison with that of the CSM. This leads to a larger ice reduction in the DOE model, thus also contributing to the enhanced contribution from ice albedo feedback in the DOE model in comparison with the CSM.",1
"This paper outlines the growing need for energy in the developed and developing countries and the acute population growth, which will exceed 10 billion by the year 2050. It describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower, biomass conversion, geothermal, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion, and the increasing usage of photovoltaics. The paper also addresses the barriers and problems facing renewable energy users and producers. It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate as well as the terrain of many countries unless drastic measures are taken. The recent Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO2 emissions and abiding by some form of agreement to reduce emissions. The present study concludes that renewable energy penetration into the energy market is much faster than was expected in recent years and by 2030, 15-20% of our prime energy will be met by renewable energy.",1
"This paper examines discourses of stakeholders regarding global climate change to assess whether and how they construct industrial animal agriculture as posing a risk. The analysis assesses whether these discourses have shifted since the release of Livestock's Long Shadow, a report by the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization, which indicated that the industrial animal agriculture sector as a whole contributes more to global climate change than the transportation sector. Using Ulrich Beck's theorizing of the ""risk society,"" this paper examines how various animal rights and welfare groups, environmental organizations, meat industry stakeholders, governmental agencies, and newspapers in Canada, the United States, and internationally investigate and construct industrial animal agriculture as a risk, if at all, and how their respective discourses conflict. The findings indicate that while some stakeholders acknowledge industrial animal agriculture's contribution to global climate change, for the most part the problematization of animal agriculture has not increased since the release of Livestock's Long Shadow, and the animal agriculture industry has seemingly not lost its power to ""rationalize risk.""",1
"CO(2) emissions, which induce global warming, increase with the development of economic activity. It is impossible to decrease the CO(2) emissions by suppression of the economic activity. Global CO(2) recycling can solve this problem. The global CO(2) recycling consists of three district: The electricity is generated by solar cells on deserts. At desert coasts, the electricity is used for H(2) production by seawater electrolysis and H(2) is used for CH(4) production by the reaction with CO(2) CH(4) which is the main component of liquefied natural gas is liquefied and transported to energy consuming districts where CO(2) is recovered, liquefied and transported to the desert coasts. A CO(2) recycling plant for substantiation of our idea has been built on the roof of the Institute for Materials Research in 1996. Key materials necessary for the global CO(2) recycling are the anode and cathode for seawater electrolysis and the catalyst for CO(2) conversion. All or them have been tailored by us. They have very high activity and selectivity for necessary reactions in addition to excellent durability. A pilot plant consisting of minimum units in an industrial scale is going to be built in three years. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1

"A series of absolute dates for surface sediments in the Taklimakan Desert, reveals the evolution of aeolian processes over the past 30,000 years. Sandy materials from flood plains and palaeo-lacustrine plains through wind erosion are the main sources of the desert. Cold air intrusions from the northeast of the Tarim Basin are the main form of aeolian motivation. During the past 30,000 years, an arid climate has dominated the desert. However, sand sources and wind conditions affected by ice, snow cover, glacial meltwater and lower evaporation as well as more stable air conditions during very cold periods may have led to temporary decreases in aeolian actions. In contrast with other Chinese deserts, the evolution of the Taklimakan Desert has seen alternating periods of hot, arid, strong aeolian action and cold, relatively humid, weak aeolian action in response to global climate changes. It is predicted that desertification will continue due to the effects of global warming.",1
"Soil erosion and contamination are two main desertification indices or land degradation agents in agricultural areas. Global climate change consequence is a priority to predict global environmental change impacts on these degradation risks. This agro-ecological approach can be especially useful when formulating soil specific agricultural practices based on the spatial variability of soils and related resources to reverse environmental degradation. Raizal and Pantanal models within the new MicroLEIS framework, the Ero&Con package, are database/expert system evaluation approach for assessing limitations to land use, or vulnerability of the land to specified agricultural degradation risks. This study was performed in Souma area with approximately 4100 ha extension in the North-West of Iran (west Azarbaijan). Based on 35 sampling soils, Typic Xerofluvents, Typic Calcixerepts, Fluventic Haploxerepts and Fluventic Endaquepts were classified as main subgroups. Climatological data, referred to temperature and precipitation of more than 36 consecutive years were collected from Urmieh station reports and stored in monthly Climate Database CDBm, as a major component of MicroLEIS DSS (CDBm) program. Climate data for a hypothetical future scenario were collected from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports for the 2080s period. The evaluation approach predicts that attainable water erosion vulnerability classes were none (V1) very low (V2) and moderately low (V4) in the total of 72%, 13% and 15% of the Souma area, respectively and they will not affected by climate change. On contrary, attainable wind erosion vulnerability classes will increase. Also, phosphorous and heavy metal contamination vulnerability risks will not differ in two compared scenarios while nitrogen and pesticides vulnerability classes will be improved.",1
"After three sessions of the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change, global warming negotiations appear to have polarized around two key issues. Countries are divided over how strictly the treaty should control greenhouse gas emissions and how to share the hardship of emission controls in the most fair and equitable manner. The United States' ""go slow"" position has frustrated European efforts to create a convention with binding targets and timetables for reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Developing nations fear that the United States' refusal to control CO2 emissions signals a lack of commitment toward halting global warming and foreshadows future equity conflicts over financial and technical assistance to help them adopt ""climate friendly"" development paths. Nevertheless, early negotiating positions can be deceptive. The existence of many significant, low cost energy reforms indicates the existence of untapped bargaining space for overcoming these immediate deadlocks. However, these ""no regrets"" energy reforms are only the easy, first steps toward arresting climate disruption. Powerful and deeply entrenched social forces will resist an increasingly desperate need to dramatically reduce the global combustion of fossil fuels.",1
"The use of fossil fuel is predicted to cause an increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, which will affect the global pattern of temperature and precipitation. It is therefore essential to incorporate effects of temperature and water supply on the carbon requirement for root respiration of plants to predict effects of elevated [CO2] on the carbon budget of natural and managed systems. There is insufficient information to support the contentention that an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will enhance the CO2 concentration in the soil to an extent that is likely to affect root respiration. Moreover, there is no convincing evidence for a direct effect of elevated atmospheric [CO2] on the rate of root respiration per unit root mass or the fraction of carbon required for root respiration. However, there are likely to be indirect effects of elevated [CO2] on the carbon requirement of plants in natural systems. Firstly, it is very likely that the carbon requirement of root respiration relative to that fixed in photosynthesis will increase when elevated [CO2] induces a decrease in nutrient status of the plants. Although earlier papers have emphasized that elevated [CO2] favours investment of biomass in roots relative to that in leaves, these are in fact indirect effects. The increase in root weight ratio is due to the more rapid depletion of nutrients in the root environment as a consequence of enhanced growth. This will decrease the specific rate of root respiration, but increase the carbon requirement as a fraction of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis. It is likely that these effects will be minor in systems where the nutrient supply is very high, e.g, in many managed arable systems, and increase with decreasing soil fertility, i.e. in many natural systems. Secondly, a decrease in rainfall in some parts of the world may cause a shortage in water supply which favours the carbon partitioning to roots. Water stress is likely to reduce rates of root respiration per unit root mass, but enhance the fraction of total assimilates required for root respiration, due to greater allocation of biomass to roots. Increased temperatures are unlikely to affect the specific rate of root respiration in all species. Broadly generalized, the effect of temperature on biomass allocation is that the relative investment of biomass in roots is lowest at a certain optimum temperature and increases at both higher and lower temperatures. The root respiration of some species acclimates to growth temperature, so that the effect of global temperature rise is entirely accounted for by the effect of temperature on biomass allocation. The specific rate of root respiration of other species will increase with global warming. In response to global warming the carbon requirement of roots is likely to decrease in temperate regions, when temperatures are suboptimal for the roots' capacity to acquire water. Here global warming will induce a smaller biomass allocation to the roots. Conversely, the carbon requirements are more likely to increase in mediterranean environments, where temperatures are often supraoptimal and a rise in temperature will induce greater allocation of biomass to the roots.",1
"In order to quantitatively analyze the environmental impact of wood pellets produced in Hokkaido. we carried out a life cycle impact assessment using LIME2 The external cost of the pellets was estimated at 1461 yen/t, and the impact of CO2 emissions on global warming accounted for 45% of the cost The production process of the pellets has the highest CO2 emissions in the life cycle, and thus improvement of productivity in the process is important for reduction of the impact In a comparison of life cycle impact among 5 heating systems, the external cost of the pellet stove heating system was smallest, since the combustion of wood is regarded as carbon-neutral CO2 emissions could be reduced to the range of 753 to 5642 kg/household/year if the pellet stove heating system was introduced to general households in Hokkaido For example. introducing that system as an alternative for the kerosene stove heating system would reduce CO2 emissions by 43% per household a year",1
"In this paper, a new methodology for global estimation of crop productivity is proposed. This methodology integrates Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) model with Geographic Information System (GIS) and Inference Engine (IE) technique. EPIC was developed by USDA to analyze the relationship between soil erosion and agricultural productivity just at field level. With the integration of GIS, EPIC can be extended to the application of global or regional level. In this integration, IE is developed to determine possible crop combinations, the optimum starting and ending dates of growth cycle for each crop type and grid cell, in order to ensure best possible crop yields for both rain-fed and irrigated conditions. A case of global crop productivity estimation is tested with GIS-based EPIC in 2000. National averages are computed to be comparable to yields in FAO statistics. The comparison indicates that the GIS-based EPIC is able to simulate crop productivity at global level. In addition, with the global climate change data provided by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from the first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model (CGCM1), GIS-based EPIC is run for scenarios of future climate in the year of 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 to predict the effects of global warming on main crop yields. Results show the global warming will be harmful for most of the countries, and an efficient adaptation to alternative climates tends to reduce the damages. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

"The possible response of forest ecosystems of south taiga at the south of Valdai Hills on projected future global warming was assessed using analysis of pollen, plant macrofossil and radiocarbon data from four profiles of buried organic sediments of the last interglacial and several cores from modern raised bogs and two small forest mires in the Central Forest State Natural Biosphere Reserve (CFSNBR; Twer region, Russia). The future pattern of climatic conditions for the period up to 2100 was derived using the data of A2, B1 and A1B emission scenarios calculated by the global climatic model ECHAM5-MPIOM (Roeckner E et al 2003 The Atmospheric General Circulation Model ECHAM 5. PART I: Model Description, Report 349 (Hamburg: Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology) p 127). The paleoclimatic reconstructions showed that the optimum of the Holocene (the Late Atlantic period, 4500-4800 (14)C yr BP) and the optimal phases of the last interglacial (Mikulino, Eemian, 130 000-115 000 yr BP) can be considered as possible analogs for projected climatic conditions of the middle and the end of the 21st century, respectively. The climate of the CFSNBR during the Holocene climatic optimum was characterized by higher winter (about 3 degrees C higher than at present) and summer temperatures (about 1 degrees C higher than present values). Precipitation was close to present values (about 600-800 mm yr(-1)). Vegetation was represented by mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest. In the warmest phases of the last interglacial the winter temperature was 5-8 degrees C higher than present values. The summer temperatures were also about 2-4 degrees C higher. Broad-leaved and hornbeam trees were the dominant tree species in vegetation cover.",1
"Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. It has a global warming potential (GWP) 23 times greater than carbon dioxide. Reducing methane emissions would lead to Substantial economic and environmental benefits. This study investigated the performance of multi-transition-metal-(Cu, Cr, Ni, and Co)-ion-exchanged zeolite 13X catalysts in methane emissions abatement. The catalytic activity in methane combustion using multi-ion-exchanged catalysts was studied with different parameters including the molar percentage of metal loading, the space velocity, and the inlet methane concentration under atmospheric pressure and at a relatively low reaction temperature of 500 degrees C. The performance of the catalysts was determined in terms of the apparent activation energy, the number of active sites of the catalyst, and the BET Surface area of the catalyst. This study showed that multi-ion-exchanged catalysts outperformed single-ion-exchanged and acidified 13X catalysts and that lengthening the residence time led to a higher methane conversion percentage. The enhanced catalytic activity in the multi-ion-exchanged catalysts was attributed to the presence of exchanged transition ions instead of acid sites in the catalyst. The catalytic activity of the catalysts was influenced by the metal loading amount, which played an important role in affecting the apparent activation energy for methane combustion, the active sites, and the BET surface area of the catalyst. Increasing the amount of metal loading in the catalyst decreased the apparent activation energy for methane combustion and also the BET Surface area of the catalyst. An optimized metal loading amount at which the highest catalytic activity was observed due to the combined effects of the various factors was determined. (C) 2008 The Combustion Institute.

"Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) record profound changes in the climatic and paleoceanographic state of the planet and represent major disturbances in the global carbon cycle. OAEs that manifestly caused major chemical change in the Mesozoic Ocean include those of the early Toarcian (Posidonienschiefer event, T-OAE, similar to 183 Ma), early Aptian (Selli event, OAE 1a, similar to 120 Ma), early Albian (Paquier event, OAE 1b, similar to 111 Ma), and Cenomanian-Turonian (Bonarelli event, C/T OAE, OAE 2, similar to 93 Ma). Currently available data suggest that the major forcing function behind OAEs was an abrupt rise in temperature, induced by rapid influx of CO2 into the atmosphere from volcanogenic and/or methanogenic sources. Global warming was accompanied by an accelerated hydrological cycle, increased continental weathering, enhanced nutrient discharge to oceans and lakes, intensified upwelling, and an increase in organic productivity. An increase in continental weathering is typically recorded by transient increases in the seawater values of Sr-87/Sr-86 and Os-187/Os-188 ratios acting against, in the case of the Cenomanian-Turonian and early Aptian OAEs, a longer-term trend to less radiogenic values. This latter trend indicates that hydrothermally and volcanically sourced nutrients may also have stimulated local increases in organic productivity. Increased flux of organic matter favored intense oxygen demand in the water column, as well as increased rates of marine and lacustrine carbon burial. Particularly in those restricted oceans and seaways where density stratification was favored by paleogeography and significant fluvial input, conditions could readily evolve from poorly oxygenated to anoxic and ultimately euxinic (i.e., sulfidic), this latter state being geochemically the most significant. The progressive evolution in redox conditions through phases of denitrification/anammox, through to sulfate reduction accompanied by water column precipitation of pyrite framboids, resulted in fractionation of many isotope systems (e.g., N, S, Fe, Mo, and U) and mobilization and incorporation of certain trace elements into carbonates (Mn), sulfides, and organic matter. Sequestration of CO2 in organic-rich black shales and by reaction with silicate rocks exposed on continents would ultimately restore climatic equilibrium but at the expense of massive chemical change in the oceans and over time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years.",1
"The past relationship between global temperature and levels of biological diversity is of increasing concern due to anthropogenic climate warming. However, no consistent link between these variables has yet been demonstrated. We analysed the fossil record for the last 520 Myr against estimates of low latitude sea surface temperature for the same period. We found that global biodiversity (the richness of families and genera) is related to temperature and has been relatively low during warm 'greenhouse' phases, while during the same phases extinction and origination rates of taxonomic lineages have been relatively high. These findings are consistent for terrestrial and marine environments and are robust to a number of alternative assumptions and potential biases. Our results provide the first clear evidence that global climate may explain substantial variation in the fossil record in a simple and consistent manner. Our findings may have implications for extinction and biodiversity change under future climate warming.",1
"By the end of the 21st century, according to United Nations projections, the number of people on the earth is likely to have approximately doubled. How can a world of 10 to 12 billion people be provided with adequate supplies of energy, cleanly, safely and substantially? There is a growing consensus that renewable energy sources will be a very important part of the answer. The growing interest in ""renewables"" has been prompted in part, by increasing concern over the pollution, resource depletion and possible climate change implications of our continuing use of conventional fossil and nuclear fuels. But recent technological developments have also improved the cost-effectiveness of many of the renewables. making their economic prospects look increasingly attractive. it describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower, biomass conversion, geothermal, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion and the increasing usage of photovoltaics. It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate as well as the terrain of many countries unless drastic measures are taken. The Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO, emissions and to abide by some form of agreement to reduce emissions. Present study concludes that renewable energy penetration into the energy market is much faster than was expected in recent years and by 2030, 15-20 percent of our prime energy will be met by renewable energy.",1
"The global carbon cycle is significantly influenced by changes in the use and management of forests and agriculture. Humans have the potential through changes in land use and management to alter the magnitude of forest-carbon stocks and the direction of forest-carbon fluxes. However, controversy over the use of biological means to absorb or reduce emissions of CO2 (often referred to as carbon 'sinks') has arisen in the context of the Kyoto Protocol. The controversy is based primarily on two arguments: sinks may allow developed nations to delay or avoid actions to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and the technical and operational difficulties are too threatening to the successful implementation of land use and forestry projects for providing carbon offsets. Here we discuss the importance of including carbon sinks in efforts to address global warming and the consequent additional social, environmental and economic benefits to host countries. Activities in tropical forest lands provide the lowest cost methods both of reducing emissions and reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. We conclude that the various objections raised as to the inclusion of carbon sinks to ameliorate climate change can be addressed by existing techniques and technology. Carbon sinks provide a practical available method of achieving meaningful reductions in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide while at the same time contribute to national sustainable development goals.",1
"A pronounced negative carbon-isotope (delta(13)C) excursion of similar to 5-7 parts per thousand (refs 1 - 7) indicates the occurrence of a significant perturbation to the global carbon cycle during the Early Jurassic period (early Toarcian age, similar to 183 million years ago). The rapid release of C-12-enriched biogenic methane as a result of continental-shelf methane hydrate dissociation has been put forward as a possible explanation for this observation(1,7,8). Here we report high-resolution organic carbon-isotope data from well-preserved mudrocks in Yorkshire, UK, which demonstrate that the carbon-isotope excursion occurred in three abrupt stages, each showing a shift of -2 parts per thousand to -3 parts per thousand. Spectral analysis of these carbon-isotope measurements and of high-resolution carbonate abundance data reveals a regular cyclicity. We interpret these results as providing strong evidence that methane release proceeded in three rapid pulses and that these pulses were controlled by astronomically forced changes in climate, superimposed upon longer-term global warming. We also find that the first two pulses of methane release each coincided with the extinction of a large proportion of marine species(9).",1
"Facing the threat of oil depletion and climate change, a shift from fossil resources to renewables is ongoing to secure long-term low carbon energy supplies. In view of the carbon dioxide reduction targets agreed upon in the Kyoto protocol, bioethanol has become an attractive option for one energy application, as transport fuel. Many studies on the LCA of fuel ethanol have been conducted, and the results vary to a large extent. In most of these studies, only one type of allocation is applied. However, the effect of allocation on outcomes is of crucial importance to LCA as a decision supporting tool. This is only addressed in a few studies to a limited extent. Moreover, most of the studies mainly focus on fossil energy use and GHG emissions. In this paper, a case study is presented wherein a more complete set of impact categories is used. Land use has been left out of account as only hectare data would be given which is obviously dominated by agriculture. Moreover, different allocation methods are applied to assess the sensitivity of the outcomes for allocation choices. This study focuses on the comparison of LCA results from the application of different allocation methods by presenting an LCA of gasoline and ethanol as fuels and with two types of blends of gasoline with ethanol, all used in a midsize car. As a main second-generation application growing fast in the USA, corn stover-based ethanol is chosen as a case study. The life cycles of the fuels include gasoline production, corn and stover agriculture, cellulosic ethanol production, blending ethanol with gasoline to produce E10 (10% of ethanol) and E85 (85% of ethanol), and finally the use of gasoline, E10, E85, and ethanol. In this study, a substantially broader set of eight environmental impacts is covered. LCA results appear to be largely dependent on the allocation methods rendered. The level of abiotic depletion and ozone layer depletion decrease when replacing gasoline by ethanol fuels, irrespective of the allocation method applied, while the rest of the impacts except global warming potential are larger. The results show a reduction of global warming potential when mass/energy allocation is applied; in the case of economic allocation, it gives contrary results. In the expanded systems, global warming potential is significantly reduced comparing to the ones from the allocated systems. A contribution analysis shows that car driving, electricity use for cellulase enzyme production, and ethanol conversion contribute largely to global warming potential from the life cycle of ethanol fuels. The reason why the results of global warming potential show a reverse trend is that the corn/stover allocation ratio shifts from 7.5 to 7 when shifting from economic allocation to mass/energy allocation. When mass/energy allocation is applied, both more credits (CO(2) uptake) and more penalties (N(2)O emission) in agriculture are allocated to stover compared to the case of economic allocation. However, more CO(2) is taken up than N(2)O (in CO(2) eq.) emitted. Hence, the smaller the allocation ratio is between corn and stover, the lower the share of the overall global warming emissions being allocated to ethanol will be. In the system expansion approach, global warming potentials are significantly reduced, resulting in the negative values in all cases. This implies that the system expansion results are comparable to one another because they make the same cutoffs but not really to the results related to mass, energy, and economic value-based allocated systems. The choice of the allocation methods is essential for the outcomes, especially for global warming potential in this case. The application of economic allocation leads to increased GWP when replacing gasoline by ethanol fuels, while reduction of GWP is achieved when mass/energy allocation is used as well as in the system where biogenic CO(2) is excluded. Ethanol fuels are better options than gasoline when abiotic depletion and ozone layer depletion are concerned. In terms of other environmental impacts, gasoline is a better option, mainly due to the emissions of nutrients and toxic substances connected with agriculture. A clear shift of problems can be detected: saving fossil fuels at the expense of emissions related to agriculture, with GHG benefits depending on allocation choices. The overall evaluation of these fuel options, therefore, depends very much on the importance attached to each impact category. This study focuses only on corn stover-based ethanol as one case. Further studies may include other types of cellulosic feedstocks (i.e., switchgrass or wood), which require less intensive agricultural practice and may lead to better environmental performance of fuel ethanol. Furthermore, this study shows that widely used but different allocation methods determine outcomes of LCA studies on biofuels. This is an unacceptable situation from a societal point of view and a challenge from a scientific point of view. The results from applying just one allocation method are not sufficient for decision making. Comparison of different allocation methods is certainly of crucial importance. A broader approach beyond LCA for the analysis of biorefinery systems with regard to energy conservation, environmental impact, and cost-benefit will provide general indications on the sustainability of bio-based productions.",1
"The responses of tropical cyclone (TC) potential intensity ( PI) and the associated environmental control parameters over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) to the doubled CO(2) concentration are assessed based on the ensemble simulation from 15 coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) participated in the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Forth Assessment Report (AR4). The results show that the annual mean sea surface temperature (SST) averaged over the NIO increases 71 degrees C. The thermodynamic efficiency changes little because the outflow layer temperature increases accordingly. The monthly mean vertical shear decreases across the NIO with a maximum decrease of 8% in May - June except for a small increase in April. The dynamic efficiency decreases to the north of 10 degrees N over Bay of Bengal while increases significantly in the southern NIO in response to the doubled CO2 concentration. The PI increases by 4.6% and 5.9% averaged over Arabian Sea and 2.0% and 4.86% averaged over Bay of Bengal during TC and summer monsoon seasons, respectively. An important finding is the significant increase in PI in May when the background PI is already high and the potentially longer TC season in response to global warming due to the decrease in vertical shear in June and September.

"Over 250 respondents - graduate students in law and public policy - assessed the risks of climate change and valued climate-change mitigation policies. Many aspects of their behavior were consistent with rational behavior. For example, respondents successfully estimated distributions of temperature increases in Boston by 2100. The median value of best estimates was 1-3 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, people with higher risk estimates, whether for temperature or related risks (e.g., hurricane intensities) offered more to avoid warming. Median willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid global warming was $0.50/gallon, and 3% of income. And important scope tests (e.g., respondents paid more for bigger accomplishments) were passed. However, significant behavioral propensities also emerged. For example, accessibility of neutral information on global warming boosted risk estimates. Warming projections correlated with estimates for unrelated risks, such as earthquakes and heart attacks. The implied WTP for avoidance was much greater when asked as a percent of income than as a gas tax, a percent thinking bias. Home team betting showed itself; individuals predicting a Bush victory predicted smaller temperature increases. In the climate-change arena, behavioral decision tendencies are like a fun-house mirror: They magnify some estimates and shrink others, but the contours of rational decision rmain recognizable.",1
"Fluxes of trace gases from northern ecosystems represent a highly uncertain and potentially significant component of the arctic land-atmosphere system, especially in the context of greenhouse-induced climate change. The initial goal of the Arctic Flux Study (a part of NSF's Arctic System Science Program) is a regional estimate of the present and future movement of materials between the land, atmosphere and ocean in the Kuparuk River basin in northern Alaska. We are measuring rates and controls of processes along a north-south transect running from the marshy coastal plain to mountain valleys. Important vertical fluxes under study are the release of CO2 and CH4 from soils and water, lateral fluxes are surface water, nutrients, and organic matter. A hierarchy of measurements allow the rates and understanding of processes to be scaled from plots to the landscape, regional, and circumarctic level. These include gas flux measurements in small chambers, measurements over larger areas by eddy correlation from small towers, and measurements at the landscape scale from airplane overflights. Experimental manipulations of carbon dioxide, soil moisture, nutrients and soil temperature from this and other studies give information on process controls. The distribution of plant communities has been described at several landscape-scale sites and a hierarchic GIS has been developed for the region at three scales (plot, landscape, region). Climate is measured at six sites and hydrological processes are being studied at each watershed scale. In the soils, measurements are being made of soil organic matter and active layer thickness and of availability of soil organic matter for microbial transformation into CO2 and CH4. Fluxes and process understanding have been incorporated into a hierarchy of models at different scales. These include models of regional climate nested in a GCM; of regional- and continental-scale plant productivity and carbon cycling including CO2 release under altered climates; watershed and regional models of hydrology; and surface energy budgets. After the first year of study the regional climate model has been successfully configured to the northern Alaska region We have also measured a large release of carbon dioxide from tundra soils in all but the coldest and wettest parts of the transect. The rates from eddy correlation towers (landscape level) agree closely with rates from chambers (plot level). Observations, experimental manipulations and modelling analyses result in the prediction that the combination of warmer and drier soils is responsible for the large CO2 release.",1
"The global warming intensities of crop-based biofuels and fossil fuels differ not only in amount but also in their discharge patterns over time. Early discharges, for example, from market-mediated land use change, will have created more global warming by any time in the future than later discharges, owing to the slow decay of atmospheric CO2. A spreadsheet model of this process, BTIME, captures this important time pattern effect using the Bern CO2 decay model to allow fuels to be compared for policy decisions on the basis of their real warming effects with a variety of user-supplied parameter values. The model also allows economic discounting of climate effects extended far into the future. Compared to approaches that simply sum greenhouse gas emissions over time, recognizing the physics of atmospheric CO2 decay significantly increases the deficit relative to fossil fuel of any biofuel causing land use change.",1
"The paper presents the results of simulation experiments conducted for the assessment of likely changes in the cyclogenesis pattern in the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and the Arabian Sea (AS) resulting from global climate change. Two experiments were performed, namely the 'control' (CTL) experiment in which the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere was fixed as per 1990 levels and the 'greenhouse gas' (GHG) experiment in which an annual compound increase of 1% from 1990 onwards was introduced. CTL and GHG experiments of 20 years length were performed for the period 2041-2060. The model used is the regional climate model Had RM2 of the Hadley Centre of Climate Prediction and Research, U.K. The results have brought out some significant changes in the cyclogenesis pattern in the North Indian Ocean (BOB and AS). The most significant likely change is the increase in the frequency of post-monsoon storms in the Bay of Bengal. The experiments show an increase of about 50% in the post-monsoonal cyclogenesis by 2041-2060 as a result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The frequency of monsoon depressions / storms in the BOB is likely to decrease considerably during June-August. Due to varying impacts in different seasons, the annual frequency of cyclonic disturbances may change marginally in the BOB. In the Arabian Sea, however the model has simulated a significant reduction in the frequency which may be halved by the period 2041-2060. The results show intensification of storms during May-June and September-November. The monsoon depressions during July-August are likely to become less intense. In GHG experiment most of the post-monsoon storms have a tendency to strike north Andhra-Orissa coasts whereas in CTL experiment the storms strike coast from Tamilnadu to south Orissa. Thus, the focus of post-monsoon storms in the BOB is likely to shift northwards from Tamilnadu-Andhra Pradesh coast to north Andhra Pradesh-south Orissa coast. Another important simulated change in storm tracks is that more number of pre-monsoon storms in the BOB may have a tendency to recurve north or northeastwards by 2041-2060.",1
"A new low global warming refrigerant, CF(3)CF=CH(2) (HFO-1234yf), has been developed to replace HFC-134a in automotive air conditioning systems. HFC-134a is being phased out in the European Union due to high global warming potential. HFO-1234yf is highly energy efficient, exhibits low toxicity, and can potentially be used in systems currently designed for refrigerant HFC-134a with minimal modifications. Significant work has been completed to assess the flammability characteristics of HFO-1234yf. Though it is flammable per ASTM E-681, it is significantly less so than HFC-152a which has also been considered as an HFC-134a alternative. HFO-1234yf has a relatively high lower flammability limit at 6.2 vol% in air Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling has shown it is very unlikely the lower flammability limit will be reached when the refrigerant is leaked into the passenger compartment of a vehicle. HFO-1234yf also has a high minimum ignition energy (MIE) from 5,000 to 10,000 mJ which indicates there may be very lbw potential ignition sources in a vehicle. It also has very low burning velocity at 5 cm/sec indicating low potential for damage should an ignition occur. Several automotive industry groups have completed extensive risk assessments which have concluded HFO-1234yf is safe to use as a refrigerant in vehicles. This article will review flammability test results and challenges that were overcome to measure flammability of a mildly flammable refrigerant as well as CFD modeling work for vehicle leakage scenarios.

" Analyses of foraminiferal delta(18)O (delta(18)O(carb)), delta(13)C (delta(13)C(carb)) and bulk organic matter (delta(13)C(org)) across a tropical Eocene/Oligocene boundary (EOB) section from Kutch basin, western India show that the ocean cooling ( at least similar to3degreesC) is coincident with a rapid enrichment (similar to3parts per thousand) in delta(13)C(org) but depletion (similar to5parts per thousand) in delta(13)C(carb). The decrease in pCO(2) in ocean-atmosphere system across the boundary, possibly resulting from enhanced silicate weathering in rising Himalayas and accompanied organic carbon burial in ocean, caused the cooling and delta(13)C(org) enrichment. The end-Eocene climatic stress decreased the oceanic productivity (and delta(13)C(carb)) eventually causing extinction of larger benthic foraminiferal community. The data suggest a critical role of tropical ocean and direct forcing of CO2 on global climate change at least for this crucial Cenozoic transition.",1
"Acidic northern wetlands are an important source of methane, one of the gases that contributes to global warming. Methane oxidation in the surface of these acidic wetlands can reduce the methane flux to the atmosphere up to 90 percent. Here the isolation of three methanotrophic microorganisms from three boreal forest sites is reported. They are moderately acidophilic organisms and have a soluble methane monooxygenase, In contrast to the known groups of methanotrophs, 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis shows that they are affiliated with the acidophilic heterotrophic bacterium Beijerinckia indica subsp. indica.",1
"CARBON monoxide plays an important role in the oxidizing capacity of the Earth's atmosphere, and may thereby indirectly affect the concentrations of many man-made and natural trace gases, which in turn affect climate, atmospheric chemistry and the ozone layer(1). CO is produced in the atmosphere by the oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons, and is released into the atmosphere from automobiles, agricultural waste and the burning of savanna(1-4). Recent estimates' show that human activities such as these are presently responsible for more than half the annual emissions of CO. During the 1980s there was evidence that atmospheric CO concentrations were increasing at similar to 2 +/- 0.6% per year, leading to feedbacks that could amplify global warming. Here we present a continuation of these measurements which show that from 1988 to 1992 global CO concentrations have started to decline rapidly at a rate of about -2.6 +/- 0.8% per gear. A recent study(5) has verified our findings with data from the past 3-4 years. The rate of decrease is particularly rapid in the Southern Hemisphere; we hypothesize that this mag reflect a reduction in tropical biomass burning. The total amount of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere is less now than a decade ago.",1
"Temperature and precipitation extremes and their potential future changes are evaluated in an ensemble of global coupled climate models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC) diagnostic exercise for the Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4). Climate extremes are expressed in terms of 20- yr return values of annual extremes of near- surface temperature and 24-h precipitation amounts. The simulated changes in extremes are documented for years 2046 - 65 and 2081 - 2100 relative to 1981 - 2000 in experiments with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ( SRES) B1, A1B, and A2 emission scenarios. Overall, the climate models simulate present- day warm extremes reasonably well on the global scale, as compared to estimates from reanalyses. The model discrepancies in simulating cold extremes are generally larger than those for warm extremes, especially in sea ice - covered areas. Simulated present- day precipitation extremes are plausible in the extratropics, but uncertainties in extreme precipitation in the Tropics are very large, both in the models and the available observationally based datasets. Changes in warm extremes generally follow changes in the mean summertime temperature. Cold extremes warm faster than warm extremes by about 30% - 40%, globally averaged. The excessive warming of cold extremes is generally confined to regions where snow and sea ice retreat with global warming. With the exception of northern polar latitudes, relative changes in the intensity of precipitation extremes generally exceed relative changes in annual mean precipitation, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Consistent with the increased intensity of precipitation extremes, waiting times for late- twentieth- century extreme precipitation events are reduced almost everywhere, with the exception of a few subtropical regions. The multimodel multiscenario consensus on the projected change in the globally averaged 20- yr return values of annual extremes of 24- h precipitation amounts is that there will be an increase of about 6% with each kelvin of global warming, with the bulk of models simulating values in the range of 4% - 10% K- The very large intermodel disagreements in the Tropics suggest that some physical processes associated with extreme precipitation are not well represented in models. This reduces confidence in the projected changes in extreme precipitation.",1
"The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that global warming is ""unequivocal"" and that most of the observed increase since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, with discernible human influences on ocean warming, continental-average temperatures, temperature extremes, wind patterns, and other physical and biological indicators, impacting both socioeconomic and ecological systems. It is now clear that we are committed to some level of global climate change, and it is imperative that this be considered when planning future climate research and observational strategies. The Global Climate Observing System program (GCOS), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) therefore initiated a process to summarize the lessons learned through AR4 Working Groups I and II and to identify a set of high-priority modeling and observational needs. Two classes of recommendations emerged. First is the need to improve climate models, observational and climate monitoring systems, and our understanding of key processes. Second, the framework for climate research and observations must be extended to document impacts and to guide adaptation and mitigation efforts. Research and observational strategies specifically aimed at improving our ability to predict and understand impacts, adaptive capacity, and societal and ecosystem vulnerabilities will serve both purposes and are the subject of the specific recommendations made in this paper.",1
"Background, Aims and Scope. Many feed ingredients are not fully digested by livestock. However, the addition of digestibility-improving enzymes to the feed can improve the absorption of e.g. energy and protein and thereby enhance the nutrient value of the feed. Feed production is a major source of environmental impacts in animal production, and it is obvious to assume that enzyme supplementation can help to reduce the environmental impact of animal production. The purpose of the study is, therefore, to assess and compare the environmental burdens of the supplements and compare them with the savings made when enzymes are used in animal production. The properties of enzymes vary considerably and the study takes as its starting point a particular enzyme product, Ronozyme WX CT. Ronozyme WX CT is a xylanase which depolymerises xylans (a group of dietary fibres found in cereal cell walls) into smaller units. The product is a widely accepted means of improving the energy value and the protein digestibility of pig and poultry feed. The study relates to Ronozyme WX CT used for fattening pigs produced in Denmark. Methods. Lifecycle assessment is used as the analytical method, and Ronozyme WX CT production and reductions in feed consumption are modelled using SimaPro 7.0.2. Data on Ronozyme WX CT production are derived from Novozymes' production facilities in Denmark. Other data are derived from the literature and from public databases. Changes in feed consumption are determined by modelling in AgroSoft (R) feed optimisation software. Guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are used to estimate reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases resulting from reduced manure generation and changed manure composition. Results. The study shows that the use of Ronozyme WX CT to increase the nutritional value of pig feed is justified by major advantages in terms of reduced potential contribution to global warming, acidification and photochemical ozone formation and reduced use of energy, and in most cases also nutrient enrichment and use of agricultural land. Ronozyme WX CT (xylanase) is often used together with Ronozyme P5000 CT (phytase) and together the two products can contribute considerably to reducing a broad range of environmental impacts from pig production. Discussion. Reduced contribution to acidification and nutrient enrichment is partly driven by reduced feed consumption and partly reduced N-emissions with manure resulting from reduced protein content of the feed. Sensitivity analyses of a range of parameters show that the observed advantages are generally robust although exact magnitudes of environmental advantages are associated with much variation and uncertainty. It should, however, be noted that changes (e.g. of feed prices) may turn contributions to nutrient enrichment and use of agricultural land into trade-offs. Conclusions. Improvement of energy and protein value of pigfeed by application of Ronozyme xylanase and following feed savings reduces impact on environment per unit of pig-meat produced, and the enzyme product contributes to a sustainable development the Danish pork meat supply. Recommendations. Digestibility-improving enzymes are a promising means of reducing the environmental impact of pig production. The greenhouse gas reducing potential of Ronozyme WX CT in Danish pig production has been estimated at 5% and in the order of 4 million tons of CO, equivalents if the results are extended to the whole of Europe. Use of Ronozyme WX CT is driven by overall cost savings in animal production, and it is therefore recommended that digestibility-improving enzymes are given more attention as a cost-efficient means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",1
"Pollen records from the island of New Guinea, spanning the last 60 000 years, show a vegetation system sensitive to global climate change and strongly influenced by anthropogenic activity. The evidence for anthropogenic activity in pollen diagrams has focused on indirect indicators such as forest clearance, burning and increases in arable weeds. Tracing individual cultivars has proven to be very difficult as the major cultivated plants, in this case dominated by root crops, have low pollen production, are insect-pollinated or are harvested before flowering occurs. The identification of some cultivars is further restricted by limited information on pollen morphology. The pollen morphology of selected species from two genera (Pandanus and Colocasia), known to include important cultivated species, have been studied Five pollen taxa are recognised after examination by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It is shown that these can be easily distinguished on the broad criteria of pollen class, grain size and size of echini. The taxonomic and dispersal characteristics of the pollen morphology of these taxa are discussed and the implications of improved identification of cultivated species in late Quaternary pollen records are considered.",1
"Increasing tropical cyclone (TC) influence in the subtropical East Asia and decreasing TC activity in the South China Sea over the past few decades have been researched in previous studies. The singular value decomposition (SVD) of observational data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change simulations in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) shows that the observed TC track changes are linked to the leading SVD mode of global sea surface temperature (SST) warming and the associated changes in large-scale steering flows. The selected five IPCC models can generally simulate the leading mode in their ensemble control run and prediction, suggesting the possible persistence of the reported track changes by 2040.",1
"The elevated CO2 concentration in the atmosphere could induce global warming and physiological changes in plants, e.g. stomatal closure. Through FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) experiments in a paddy field, it has been confirmed that CO2-induced stomatal closure decreases transpiration, which causes a rise of leaf temperature (T-l). Thus, with elevated CO2, the probability of heat-induced spikelet sterility (HISS) of rice could increase. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) Measure differences in stomatal conductance (g(s)), particle transpiration conductance (g(p)), T-l, and particle temperature (T-p) of rice plants between FACE plots (E-CO2) and ambient plots (A-CO2) at Wuxi, China (31 degrees 37' N, 120 degrees 28' E) at heading and flowering stages. (2) Model the heat balance on a panicle surface. (3) Simulate T-p and clarify the impacts of FACE on T-p using the model. Panicles emerged and flowered about 4 days earlier in E-CO2 than in A-CO2. The measured T-p was 1 - 2 degrees C higher in E-CO2 than in A-CO2, which was equivalent to or even higher than the difference in T-l between in the two plots. The g(p) decreased with panicle age after heading, while g(s) increased asymptotically with the increase of photosynthetically active radiation. But, under both CO2 conditions, g(p), was not significantly different for the same days after heading. By modelling heat balance on a panicle surface and by simulating T-p, influences of elevated CO2 on T-p were quantified. First, lower g(p) due to older age after flowering. Second, higher air temperature (T-a) followed by higher T-l. Third, higher long wave radiation emitted from leaves (L-l). The effects of T-a and g(p) on T-p were significant but the effect of g(p) on T-p was not significant. On the same number of days after heading, the net effect of g(p) on T-p would be almost zero. Therefore, raised T-a would be a critical factor for the increase in T-p.",1
"Using two versions of the GFDL coupled ocean-atmosphere model, one where water vapor anomalies are allowed to affect the longwave radiation calculation and one where they are not, we examine the role of water vapor feedback in internal precipitation variability and greenhouse-gas-forced intensification of the hydrologic cycle. Without external forcing, the experiment with water vapor feedback produces 44% more annual-mean, global-mean precipitation variability than the one without. We diagnose the reason for this difference: In both experiments, global-mean surface temperature anomalies are associated with water vapor anomalies. However, when water vapor interacts with longwave radiation,the temperature anomalies are associated with larger anomalies in surface downward longwave radiation. This increases the temperature anomaly damping through latent heat flux, creating an evaporation anomaly. The evaporation anomaly, in turn, leads to an anomaly of nearly the same magnitude in precipitation. In the experiment without water vapor feedback, this mechanism is absent. While the interaction between longwave and water vapor has a large impact on the global hydrologic cycle internal variations, its effect decreases as spatial scales decrease, so water vapor feedback has only a very small impact on grid-scale hydrologic variability. Water vapor feedback also affects the hydrologic cycle intensification when greenhouse gas concentrations increase. By the 5th century of global warming experiments where CO2 is increased and then fixed at its doubled value, the global-mean precipitation increase is nearly an order of magnitude larger when water vapor feedback is present. The cause of this difference is similar to the cause of the difference in internal precipitation variability: When water vapor feedback is present, the increase in water vapor associated with a warmer climate enhances downward longwave radiation. To maintain surface heat balance, evaporation increases, leading to a similar increase in precipitation. This effect is absent in the experiment without water vapor feedback. The large impact of water vapor feedback on hydrologic cycle intensification does not weaken as spatial scales decrease, unlike the internal variability case. Accurate representations of water vapor feedback are therefore necessary to simulate global-scale hydrologic variability and intensification of the hydrologic cycle in global warming.",1
"Although declining oxygen concentration has been reported for the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the tropical oceans and the North Pacific Ocean, consistent with model predictions of the effects of global warming, its ecological impacts are poorly understood. We report the apparent impact of declining oxygen on midwater fishes within the OMZ of the southern California Current (CC). Principal component analysis of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) ichthyoplankton time series from 1951 to 2008 indicates that the dominant temporal pattern (principal component 1 [PC1]) represents the marked decline of the region's mesopelagic fishes during periods of reduced oxygen. Of the 27 taxa with loadings > 0.5 on PC1, 24 were mesopelagic. PC1 was strongly correlated with intermediate-water oxygen concentrations (r = 0.75, p < 0.05), which were about 20% lower in the past decade and the 1950s than in the period from 1970 to 1995. The abundance of mesopelagic fishes represented by PC1 was reduced, on average, by 63% between periods of high and low oxygen concentrations. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism is the shoaling of the hypoxic boundary layer during periods of reduced oxygen, which renders the mesopelagic fauna more vulnerable to visually orienting predators. The mesopelagic fish fauna provides a vital trophodynamic link between the marine plankton and many higher predators. The decline of deepwater fish populations has profound implications for commercial fisheries, marine food webs and marine conservation: climate models predict a 20 to 40% decline in global deepwater oxygen concentrations over the coming century.",1
"Feedback interactions between terrestrial vegetation and climate could alter predictions of the responses of both systems to a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Most previous analyses of biosphere responses to global warming have used output from equilibrium simulations of current and future climate, as compared to more recently available transient GCM simulations. We compared the vegetation responses to these two different classes of GCM simulation (equilibrium and transient) using an equilibrium vegetation distribution model, MAPSS. Average climatologies were extracted from the transient GCM simulations for current and doubled (2 x) CO2 concentrations (taken to be 2070-2099) for use by the equilibrium vegetation model. However, the 2 x CO2 climates extracted from the transient GCM simulations were not in equilibrium, having attained only about 65% of their eventual 2 x CO2 equilibrium temperature change. Most of the differences in global vegetation response appeared to be related to a very different simulated change in the pole to tropic temperature gradient. Also, the transient scenarios produced much larger increases of precipitation in temperate latitudes, commensurate with a minimum in the latitudinal temperature change. Thus, the (equilibrium) global vegetation response, under the transient scenarios, tends more to a greening than a decline in vegetation density, as often previously simulated. It may be that much of the world could become greener during the early phases of global warming, only to reverse in later, more equilibrial stages. However, whether or not the world's vegetation experiences large drought-induced declines or perhaps large vegetation expansions in early stages could be determined by the degree to which elevated CO2 will actually benefit natural vegetation, an issue still under debate. There may occur oscillations, perhaps on long timescales, between greener and drier phases, due to different frequency responses of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-biosphere interactions. Such oscillations would likely, of themselves, impart further reverberations to the coupled Earth System.",1
"The Department of Energy (DOE) supported Parallel Climate Model (PCM) makes use of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3) and Land Surface Model (LSM) for the atmospheric and land surface components, respectively, the DOE Los Alamos National Laboratory Parallel Ocean Program (POP) for the ocean component, and the Naval Postgraduate School sea-ice model. The PCM executes on several distributed and shared memory computer systems. The coupling method is similar to that used in the NCAR Climate System Model (CSM) in that a flux coupler ties the components together, with interpolations between the different grids of the component models. Flute adjustments are not used in the PCM. The ocean component has 2/3 degrees average horizontal grid spacing with 32 vertical levels and a free surface that allows calculation of sea level changes. Near the equator, the grid spacing is approximately 1/2 degrees in latitude to better capture the ocean equatorial dynamics. The North Pole is rotated over northern North America thus producing resolution smaller than 3/3 degrees in the North Atlantic where the sinking part of the world conveyor circulation largely takes place. Because this ocean model component does not have a computational Feint at the North pole, the Arctic Ocean circulation systems are more realistic and similar to the observed. The elastic viscous plastic sea ice model has a grid spacing of 27 km to represent small-scale features such as ice transport through the Canadian Archipelago and the East Greenland current region. Results from a 300 year present-day coupled climate control simulation are presented, as well as for a transient 1% per year compound CO2 increase experiment which shows a global warming of 27 degreesC for a 10 year average at the doubling point of CO2 and 2.89 degreesC at the quadrupling point. There is a gradual warming beyond the doubling and quadrupling points with CO2 held constant. Globally averaged sea level rise at the time of CO2 control simulation are 1% per year transient 1% doubling is approximately 7 cm and at the time of quadrupling it is 23 cm. Some of the regional sea level changes are larger and reflect the adjustments in the temperature, salinity, internal ocean dynamics, surface heat flux, and wind stress on the ocean. A 0.5% per year CO2 increase experiment also was performed showing a global warming of 5 degreesC around the time of CO2 doubling and a similar warming pattern to the 1% CO2 per year increase experiment. El Nino and La Nina events in the tropical Pacific show approximately the observed frequency distribution and amplitude, which leads to near observed levels of variability on interannual time scales.",1
"Climate change associated global warming, rise in carbon dioxide concentration and uncertainties in precipitation has profound implications on Indian agriculture. Maize (Zea mays L.), the third most important cereal crop in India, has a major role to play in country's food security. Thus, it is important to analyze the consequence of climate change on maize productivity in major maize producing regions in India and elucidate potential adaptive strategy to minimize the adverse effects. Calibrated and validated InfoCrop-MAIZE model was used for analyzing the impacts of increase in temperature, carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and change in rainfall apart from HadCM3 A2a scenario for 2020, 2050 and 2080. The main insights from the analysis are threefold. First, maize yields in monsoon are projected to be adversely affected due to rise in atmospheric temperature; but increased rainfall can partly offset those loses. During winter, maize grain yield is projected to reduced with increase in temperature in two of the regions (Mid Indo-Gangetic Plains or MIGP, and Southern Plateau or SP), but in the Upper Indo-Gangetic Plain (UIGP), where relatively low temperatures prevail during winter, yield increased up to a 2.7 degrees C rise in temperature. Variation in rainfall may not have a major impact on winter yields, as the crop is already well irrigated. Secondly, the spatio-temporal variations in projected changes in temperature and rainfall are likely to lead to differential impacts in the different regions. In particular, monsoon yield is reduced most in SP (up to 35%), winter yield is reduced most in MIGP (up to 55%), while UIGP yields are relatively unaffected. Third, developing new cultivars with growth pattern in changed climate scenarios similar to that of current varieties in present conditions could be an advantageous adaptation strategy for minimizing the vulnerability of maize production in India.",1
"Si(100) wafers were oxynitrided by nitrogen plasma exposure under different conditions and thermally oxidized in dry O-2 without the use of toxic or global warming gases. The atomic concentration ratio of N/Si was 0.075 at a plasma discharge power of 0.5 kW and an exposure time of 1 min and 0.176 at a plasma power of 2.0 kW and an exposure time of 3 min, as determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. A progressive reduction in the oxidation rate with increasing N concentration, corresponding to an increase in N plasma power, was observed. The uniformity of film thickness over a 4-inch wafer was improved after nitrogen plasma exposure and rapid thermal oxidation, with a thickness variation of less than 2.6% compared with 13.2% for the N2O thermal oxidation process. The advantages of exposing Si to N plasma for application in silicon devices was investigated by high-frequency capacitance-voltage measurements. A distortion in the capacitance-voltage curve was observed for samples that did not undergo nitridation, a distortion that was not observed in the nitrided samples. Capacitance-voltage curve distortion was found to be significantly reduced by Si nitridation under low plasma power. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"The heat pump, a proven and reliable technology, has the potential to reduce primary energy consumption and the corresponding CO2-emissions for heating and cooling in domestic, commercial and industrial applications. The basic principles of heat pump technology and the anthrogenic CO2-formation under the given energy supply and demand situation in Europe and the related impact on global warming are described. An analysis of the energy flow between primary energy exploitation and the useful energy of different heating systems clearly demonstrates the ability of electric heat pumps to reduce primary energy consumption in Europe between 15 and 50%, compared with oil- and gas-heating systems. The corresponding reduction of CO2-emissions will be between 20 and 60% and up to 85% of other pollutants. The present status of alternative working fluids which do not contribute to ozone depletion is presented and the direct (working fluids) and indirect (energy consumption) impact of different heat pumps on the greenhouse effect is discussed.",1
"While agriculture in some temperate regions may benefit from global climate change, tropical and subtropical regions may suffer. Even where potential production will improve, the required adjustments may disrupt ecosystems and land-use patterns. Agricultural zones will shift toward high latitudes, while heat stress and increased droughts will reduce productivity in lower latitudes. On the positive side, higher CO2 may enhance photosynthesis and water-use efficiency. Future hazards include sea-level rise, insect infestation, and greater evaporation losses. Some agricultural activities augment the greenhouse effect by releasing CO2, CH4, and N2O. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change is a prerequisite to developing societal responses.",1
"It has been widely considered that the global warming, induced by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is an environmental task affecting the world economic development. In order to mitigate the concentration Of CO2 in the atmosphere, the sequestration of carbon dioxide into the ocean had been investigated theoretically and experimentally over the last 10 years. In addition to ocean dynamics, ocean geological, and biological information on large space and long time scales, the physical-chemistry properties of seawater-carbon dioxide system at high pressure (P > 5.0 MPa) and lower temperature (274.15 K < T < 280.15 K) (the deep ocean environment) is very important for both fundamental and engineering investigations. The density of carbon dioxide seawater solution is one of the key physical properties, which is an indispensable property for numerically estimating the dynamic evolution of carbon dioxide enriched seawater plume. In this study, the density of carbon dioxide seawater solution was measured by applying Mach-Zehnder Interferometry to a visible high-pressure vessel experimental system. The preliminary experimental results reveal that (1) the density of carbon dioxide seawater solution increases with the increase of mass fraction of carbon dioxide in its seawater solution at a pressure ranging from 4.0 to 12.0 MPa and temperatures of 276.15 and 283.15 K; (2) the density deference between carbon dioxide seawater solution and pure seawater is linearly proportional to the mass fraction of carbon dioxide and independent on pressure, temperature, and salinity; (3) the slope of this linear function of density deference with respect to carbon dioxide mass fraction is 0.273 g/cm(3), which is approximately same with that of carbon dioxide freshwater solution, the slope of which is 0.275 g/cm(3) (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"The IAP RAS climate model of intermediate complexity is used to analyze the sensitivity of the area of continuous potential permafrost S (cont) to the rate of global temperature variation T (gl) in experiments with greenhouse-gas increases in the atmosphere. The influence of the internal variability of the model on the results is reduced by conducting ensemble runs with different initial conditions and analysis of the ensemble means. Idealized experiments with a linear or exponential dependence of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have revealed an increase in the magnitude of the temperature-sensitivity parameter of the area of continuous potential permafrost, k (cont) (= S(cont, 0)(-1)/ dS (cont)/dT (gl), where S (cont, 0) is the present value of S (cont)). With a decrease in the linear trend coefficient of T (gl) from about 3 to about 2 K/100 yr, this parameter varies from approximately -0.2 to -0.4 K(-1). With an even slower change in global temperature, k (cont) virtually does not vary and remains close to the value obtained from paleoreconstructions of the past warm epochs. Such a dependence of k (cont) on the rate of global warming is related mainly to the fact that the more rapid increase in T (gl) leads to a slower response over high-latitude land. The contribution from changes in the annual temperature cycle, though comparable in the order of magnitude, is about one-third as large as the contribution from the variation of the latitudinal structure of the response of annual mean temperature. The total reduction in the annual cycle of temperature during warming partly compensates for the effect of the annual mean temperature rise, thus decreasing the magnitude of k (cont). In numerical experiments with greenhouse gas changes in accordance with SRES scenarios A2 and B2 and scenario IS92a, there is also a monotonic increase in the magnitude of the normalized parameter of temperature sensitivity of the area of continuous permafrost with a decrease in the growth rate of global temperature. For scenarios A2-CO2, IS92a-GHG, IS92a-CO2, B2-GHG, and B2-CO2, its value is almost indistinguishable from the steady-state asymptotic value of -0.4 K(-1). For A2-GHG, the magnitude of k (cont) turns out to be far less (k (cont) approximate to -0.3 K(-1)).",1
"We have characterized the relative contributions to uncertainty in predictions of global warming amount by year 2100 in the C4MIP model ensemble (Friedlingstein et al., 2006) due to both carbon cycle process uncertainty and uncertainty in the physical climate properties of the Earth system. We find carbon cycle uncertainty to be important. On average the spread in transient climate response is around 40% of that due to the more frequently debated uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity and global heat capacity. This result is derived by characterizing the influence of different parameters in a global climate-carbon cycle 'box' model that has been calibrated against the 11 General Circulation models (GCMs) and Earth system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) in the C4MIP ensemble; a collection of current state-of-the-art climate models that include an explicit representation of the global carbon cycle.",1
"The influence of agricultural production systems on greenhouse gas generation and emission is of interest as it may affect potential global climate change. Agricultural ecosystems can play a significant role in production and consumption of greenhouse gases, specifically, carbon dioxide. Information is needed on the mechanism and magnitude of gas generation and emission from agricultural soils with specific emphasis on tillage mechanisms. This work evaluated four different tillage methods on the short-term CO2 and water vapor flux from a clay loam soil in the Northern Cornbelt of the USA. The four tillage methods were moldboard plow only, moldboard plow plus disk harrow twice, disk harrow and chisel plow using standard tillage equipment following a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop compared with no tillage. The CO2 flux was measured with a large portable chamber commonly used to measure crop canopy gas exchange initiated within 5 minutes after tillage and continued intermittently for 19 days. The moldboard plow treatment buried nearly all of the residue and left the soil in a rough, loose, open condition and resulted in maximum CO2 loss. The carbon released as CO2 during the 19 days following the moldboard plow, moldboard plow plus disk harrow, disk harrow, chisel plow and not tilled treatments would account for 134%, 70%, 58%, 54% and 27% respectively of the carbon in the current year's crop residue. The short-term carbon dioxide losses 5 hours after four conservation tillage tools was only 31% of that of the moldboard plow. The moldboard plow lost 13.8 times as much CO2 as the soil area not tilled while different conservation tillage tools lost only 4.3 times. The smaller CO2 loss following conservation tillage tools is significant and suggests progress in developing conservation tillage tools that can enhance soil carbon management. Conservation tillage reduces the extent, frequency and magnitude of mechanical disturbance caused by the moldboard plow and reduces the air-filled macropores and slows the rate of carbon oxidation. Any effort to decrease tillage intensity and maximize residue return should result in carbon sequestration for enhanced environmental quality.",1
"Global climate change due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases has stimulated numerous studies and discussions about its possible impacts on water resources. Climate scenarios generated by climate models at spatial resolutions ranging from about 50 km to 400 km may not provide enough spatial specificity for use in impact assessment. In Parts I and II of this paper. the spatial specificity issue is addressed by examining what information on mesoscale and small-scale spatial features can be gained by using a regional climate model with a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover, driven by a general circulation model. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This paper describes and contrasts the large-scale and mesoscale features of the greenhouse warming climate signals simulated by the general circulation modal and regional climate model over the Pacific Northwest. Results indicate that changes in the large-scale circulation exhibit strong seasonal variability. There is an average warming of about 2 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. The precipitation signal over the Pacific Northwest is only statistically significant during spring, when both the change in the large-scale circulation and increase in water vapor enhance the moisture convergence toward the north Pacific coast. The combined effects of surface temperature and precipitation changes are such that snow cover is reduced by up to 50% on average, causing large changes in the seasonal runoff. This paper also describes the high spatial resolution (5 km) climate signals simulated by the regional climate model. Reductions in snow cover of 50%-90% are found in areas near the snow line of the control simulation. Analyses of the variations of the climate signals with surface elevation ranging from sea level to 4000 m over two mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest show that because of changes in the alitude of the freezing level, strong elevation dependency is found in the surface temperature, rainfall. snowfall, snow cover, and runoff signals.",1
"This study focuses on some of the programs and measures Brazil has undertaken over the past two or three decades in order to mitigate economic or environmental problems, which have also had positive effects on the reduction of the country's carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that, in the year 2000 alone, some 11% in CO2 emissions from energy use in Brazil have been reduced compared to what would have been emitted that year had the actions reviewed here not been implemented in good time. As these actions have not been motivated as a strategy to curb global climate change, if their benefits related to avoided carbon emissions are not fully appraised in the near future, chances are that these policies may be discontinued. For instance, in the case of the business-as-usual scenario drawn up by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in 2001, the discontinuity of the policies analyzed here would result in CO2 emissions 20% higher by 2020, compared to what would happen were these policies kept over the long term. Therefore, the perspective presented here spotlights some of the hidden benefits of the programs and measures underway in the country, justifying their continuation or even intensification.

"Public sewage treatment plants in Japan consume 6.3 billion kWh of electricity and produce 350 million tons of sludge annually, with serious impacts on the local and global environment. In this study, a Life Cycle Inventory of a sewage treatment plant for domestic wastewater was done to assess the environmental effects using data from statistics and previous studies. The system boundaries include sewage pipe construction and operation, sewage treatment plant construction and operation, material production and sludge treatment. The functional unit is defined as the treatment system of wastewater produced by one person in one year. Energy consumption and global warming are studied as the environmental parameters. The following conclusions have been drawn from the results. 1) Energy consumption and emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) increase exponentially as the population density decreases. 2) If the actual population is less than the planned population, the operation efficiency of the sewage treatment plant decreases. 3) The energy consumption per person per year is 1,026 MJ, and CO2 equivalent emission factor is 89 kg. 4) Energy consumption for sewage treatment plant operation accounts for 78% of the total energy consumption. Under the assumption that 20% of the total carbon in the sludge is converted to CH4, the CH4 emitted from sludge landfill and the N2O generated by sludge incineration contribute respectively 35% and 14% to global warming. These results also show that further development of sludge recycling technology is desirable to decrease GHGs.",1
"We consider the relative effectiveness of engineered systems for collection and marine disposal of CO2 from fossil-fuel-fired power plants using comparisons of the trend with time of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere from systems with and without marine disposal. Since the retention time for CO2 increases rapidly with depth of disposal, from a few years in the mixed layer up to several centuries as the depth increases beyond 1000 m, deep oceans have been considered as potential storage sites for CO2. However, CO2 Collection and disposal consumes energy and produces extra CO2. We show that some of this extra CO2 reaches the atmosphere, so that atmospheric concentrations from systems with marine disposal ultimately exceed those from systems without controls. In some circumstances, they do so rapidly, making marine disposal less favorable than direct atmospheric release. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) can be used to compare different systems, but results for GWP highlight the difficult issue of determining what time scales are important in considering options to reduce concerns about global warming.",1
"This paper describes how variations in agricultural policy and climatic conditions have influenced maize production and food security in 20th-century Mexico. We describe the Mexican food system today and how economic policy has influenced food output in efforts to attain food security based on the goal of national self-sufficiency. We examine the impact of climate variability on agricultural production; the ways in which agricultural policy has interacted with climate to change vulnerability to environmental and social change and the implications of global warming for the future of Mexican agriculture. Finally, we discuss the implications of the changing economic environment as Mexico has opened its economy - for example, through the North American Free Trade Agreement. Our goal is to provide a context for thinking about the implications of two types of global change for Mexico - the internationalization of economies and the widespread transformation of the environment.",1
"With weakening prospects of prompt mitigation, it is increasingly likely that the world will experience 4 degrees C and more of global warming. In such a world, adaptation decisions that have long lead times or that have implications playing out over many decades become more uncertain and complex. Adapting to global warming of 4 degrees C cannot be seen as a mere extrapolation of adaptation to 2 degrees C; it will be a more substantial, continuous and transformative process. However, a variety of psychological, social and institutional barriers to adaptation are exacerbated by uncertainty and long timeframes, with the danger of immobilizing decision-makers. In this paper, we show how complexity and uncertainty can be reduced by a systematic approach to categorizing the interactions between decision lifetime, the type of uncertainty in the relevant drivers of change and the nature of adaptation response options. We synthesize a number of issues previously raised in the literature to link the categories of interactions to a variety of risk-management strategies and tactics. Such application could help to break down some barriers to adaptation and both simplify and better target adaptation decision-making. The approach needs to be tested and adopted rapidly.",1
"The outlook for world oil demand is examined within a framework which takes account of total energy demand and the availability of oil supplies over the period to 2005. The major assumptions and uncertainties, as well as the model and rationale which underly the outlook, are discussed. The analysis points to a 30% rise in world oil demand and an 85% rise in the demand for Middle East oil between now and 2005, with a concomitant gradual rise in influence of Middle East producers over oil prices. However, major new global initiatives by governments, for example to mitigate climate change, could significantly alter the outlook by appreciably reducing the future growth in oil demand.",1
"Groundwater temperatures, especially in shallow (quaternary) aquifers respond to ground surface temperatures which in turn depend on climate and land use. Groundwater temperatures, therefore, are modified by climate change and urban development. In northern temperate climate regions seasonal temperature cycles penetrate the ground to depths on the order of 10-15 m. In this paper, we develop and apply analytic heat transfer relationships for 1-D unsteady effective diffusion of heat through an unsaturated zone into a flowing aquifer a short distance below the ground surface. We estimate how changes in land use (urban development) and climate change may affect shallow groundwater temperatures. We consider both long-term trends and seasonal cycles in surface temperature changes. Our analysis indicates that a fully urbanized downtown area at the latitude of Minneapolis/St. Paul is likely to have a groundwater temperature that is nearly 3 degrees C warmer than an undeveloped agricultural area at the same geographic location. Pavements are the main cause of this change. Data collected by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) in the St. Cloud, MN area confirm that land use influences groundwater temperatures. Ground surface temperatures are also projected to rise in response to global warming. In the extreme case of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (2 X CO2 climate scenario), groundwater temperatures in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area could therefore rise by up to 4 degrees C. Compounding a land use change from ""undeveloped"" to ""fully urbanized"" and a 2 x CO2 climate scenario, groundwater temperatures are projected to rise by about 5 degrees C at the latitude of Minneapolis/St. Paul.

"Global warming has been recognized as a serious issue since the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was published in 2007. Under these circumstances, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is expected to play a significant role, since it promises to reduce the economic gaps between developed and developing nations, as well as to economically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we first investigate how to evaluate risks in CDM. The real option theory is applied to quantify project risks in CDM, so that we can estimate the option values. In detail, a mathematical model of CDM is represented with a compound rainbow option, which includes continuous procedures from registration to investment. The evaluated results identify the condition of profitability, in which investment as CDM project is feasible. Our evaluation also quantifies how CDM projects become difficult to be executed due to the registration risk and the post-2012 risk. Then we investigate how to activate CDM projects. For this purpose, two options are considered: low interest loans by official financial institutions and the procurement of certified emission reductions, (CERs) by governments. The former relates to the low interest loans similar to environmental official development assistance (ODA), which certainly ease the financial burden of initial investments in CDM projects. Now that CDM projects related to ODA are already registered by CDM executive board, this option is worth evaluation. The latter, meanwhile, aims at lowering risks by the secure purchase of CERs by governments. Since the governments of the Netherlands and Japan have already established a system to purchase CERs generated by CDM, we need to assess the effect of the option to activate CDM. Based on actual financial data on CDM, we finally investigate how these options could increase the number of executable CDM projects.",1
"Previous climate model projections of climate change accounted for external forcing from natural and anthropogenic sources but did not attempt to predict internally generated natural variability. We present a new modeling system that predicts both internal variability and externally forced changes and hence forecasts surface temperature with substantially improved skill throughout a decade, both globally and in many regions. Our system predicts that internal variability will partially offset the anthropogenic global warming signal for the next few years. However, climate will continue to warm, with at least half of the years after 2009 predicted to exceed the warmest year currently on record.",1
"Climate sensitivity is defined as the change in global mean equilibrium temperature after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration and provides a simple measure of global warming. An early estimate of climate sensitivity, 5-4.5 degrees C, has changed little subsequently, including the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The persistence of such large uncertainties in this simple measure casts doubt on our understanding of the mechanisms of climate change and our ability to predict the response of the climate system to future perturbations. This has motivated continued attempts to constrain the range with climate data, alone or in conjunction with models. The majority of studies use data from the instrumental period (post-1850), but recent work has made use of information about the large climate changes experienced in the geological past. In this review, we first outline approaches that estimate climate sensitivity using instrumental climate observations and then summarize attempts to use the record of climate change on geological timescales. We examine the limitations of these studies and suggest ways in which the power of the palaeoclimate record could be better used to reduce uncertainties in our predictions of climate sensitivity.",1
"Spatial variations in sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall changes over the tropics are investigated based on ensemble simulations for the first half of the twenty-first century under the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario A1B with coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Despite a GHG increase that is nearly uniform in space, pronounced patterns emerge in both SST and precipitation. Regional differences in SST warming can be as large as the tropical-mean warming. Specifically, the tropical Pacific warming features a conspicuous maximum along the equator and a minimum in the southeast subtropics. The former is associated with westerly wind anomalies whereas the latter is linked to intensified southeast trade winds, suggestive of wind-evaporation-SST feedback. There is a tendency for a greater warming in the northern subtropics than in the southern subtropics in accordance with asymmetries in trade wind changes. Over the equatorial Indian Ocean, surface wind anomalies are easterly, the thermocline shoals, and the warming is reduced in the east, indicative of Bjerknes feedback. In the midlatitudes, ocean circulation changes generate narrow banded structures in SST warming. The warming is negatively correlated with wind speed change over the tropics and positively correlated with ocean heat transport change in the northern extratropics. A diagnostic method based on the ocean mixed layer heat budget is developed to investigate mechanisms for SST pattern formation. Tropical precipitation changes are positively correlated with spatial deviations of SST warming from the tropical mean. In particular, the equatorial maximum in SST warming over the Pacific anchors a band of pronounced rainfall increase. The gross moist instability follows closely relative SST change as equatorial wave adjustments flatten upper-tropospheric warming. The comparison with atmospheric simulations in response to a spatially uniform SST warming illustrates the importance of SST patterns for rainfall change, an effect overlooked in current discussion of precipitation response to global warming. Implications for the global and regional response of tropical cyclones are discussed.",1
"This study reports on an examination of the potential effects of global warming on a water resources system in Korea. Assuming a doubling in CO2 concentration (denoted 2CO(2)), basin-scale scenarios for precipitation and other hydrometeorologic variables were generated from the existing general circulation model (GCM) results. The generated temperature and precipitation scenarios were input to the NWS-PC model to generate the corresponding streamflow scenarios over the Geum river basin. A reservoir simulation model for Daecheong Dam in the Geum river basin has been developed using the object-oriented simulation environment, STELLA. For each streamflow scenario, the performance of the reservoir was assessed in terms of reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability. Although the simulation results are heavily dependent on the choice of climate change scenarios, the following conclusions can be made: the future streamflow over Daecheong Dam tends to decrease during the dry period, which seriously increases competitive water use issues; and flood control issues predominate under the 2CO(2)-High case.",1
"Impacts of global warming on streamflows were estimated for four large watersheds in New York State using a daily streamflow model. Three different 100-yr daily weather sequences were input to the model. The first was produced using statistics of current (1961-90) weather records. The second and third sequences were based on modifications of these historic statistics according to the monthly mean temperature and precipitation changes associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 as predicted by two different general circulation models. For 2 x CO2 conditions, mean annual water balances for all four watersheds indicated modest (1-9%) decreases in precipitation, but much larger (16-42%) decreases in streamflow due to increases in evapotranspiration. Winter flows generally increased, but flows in the remaining seasons often decreased. Monthly streamflow changes varied considerably among watersheds, and we could not attribute these changes to specific differences in land uses or soils.",1
"Migratory marine vertebrates move annually across remote oceanic water masses crossing international borders. Many anthropogenic threats such as overfishing, bycatch, pollution or global warming put millions of marine migrants at risk especially during their long-distance movements. Therefore, precise knowledge about these migratory movements to understand where and when these animals are more exposed to human impacts is vital for addressing marine conservation issues. Because electronic tracking devices suffer from several constraints, mainly logistical and financial, there is emerging interest in finding appropriate intrinsic markers, such as the chemical composition of inert tissues, to study long-distance migrations and identify wintering sites. Here, using tracked pelagic seabirds and some of their own feathers which were known to be grown at different places and times within the annual cycle, we proved the value of biogeochemical analyses of inert tissue as tracers of marine movements and habitat use. Analyses of feathers grown in summer showed that both stable isotope signatures and element concentrations can signal the origin of breeding birds feeding in distinct water masses. However, only stable isotopes signalled water masses used during winter because elements mainly accumulated during the long breeding period are incorporated into feathers grown in both summer and winter. Our findings shed new light on the simple and effective assignment of marine organisms to distinct oceanic areas, providing new opportunities to study unknown migration patterns of secretive species, including in relation to human-induced mortality on specific populations in the marine environment.",1
"Using the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate version 3.2 (MIROC 3.2), we investigated the physical nature of regional sea level changes due to enhanced greenhouse warming. The regional sea level changes were not spatially uniform, and their patterns were principally determined by the baroclinic component (density change) due to surface fluxes of heat, freshwater, and wind stress. Sea level changes in the barotropic circulation were mainly confined to the Southern Ocean. We decomposed the baroclinic response into vertical modes of ocean climatological stratification, considering the vertical structure of the baroclinic pressure change. The first baroclinic mode was responsible for about 78% of the variance in the baroclinic response, suggesting that the regional distribution of sea level change under global warming is mainly determined by displacement of the main pycnocline. The second and third modes were responsible for about 12% and 4% of the variance, respectively, some of which was related to subduction of the global warming signal. The decomposition of the baroclinic response mentioned above is suggestive of sea level changes due to global warming as results of region-by-region physical processes. Citation: Suzuki, T., and M.

"Climate change is expected over the next century as a result of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, and global average sea level will consequently rise. Estimates' indicate that by 2100 sea level will be about 500 mm higher than today as a result of global warming, with thermal expansion of sea water accounting for over half of this rise. The melting of glaciers and ice sheets will contribute much of the remainder. We present an improved calculation of glacier melt, which uses the temperature patterns generated by a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model(2,3) as inputs to a seasonally and regionally differentiated glacier model(4,5). Under specified greenhouse-gas and sulphate-aerosol forcings, our model predicts that glacier melt equivalent to 132 mm of sealevel rise will occur over the period 1990-2100, with a further 76 mm from melting of the Greenland ice sheet. These figures fall within the range of previous estimates made using simpler models(1); the advantage of our approach is that we take into account the effects of regional and seasonal temperature variations. Our inclusion of these effects increases the calculated glacier melt by 20%.",1
"Previous studies on ice core analyses and recent in situ measurements have shown that CH(4) has increased from about 0.75 to 73 mu mol/mol during the past 150 years. Here, we review sources and sink estimates and we present global 3D model calculations, showing that the main features of the global CH(4) distribution are well represented. The model has been used to derive the total CH(4) emission source, being about 600 Tg yr(-1). Based on published results of isotope measurements the total contribution of fossil fuel related CHI emissions has been estimated to be about 110 Tg yr(-1). However, the individual coal, natural gas and oil associated CH(4) emissions can not be accurately quantified. In particular natural gas and oil associated emissions remain speculative. Since the total anthropogenic CH(4) source is about 410 Tg yr(-1) (similar to 70% of the total source) and the mean recent atmospheric CH(4) increase is similar to 20 Tg yr(-1) an anthropogenic source reduction of 5% could stabilize the atmospheric CH(4) level. We have calculated the indirect chemical effects of increasing CH(4) on climate forcing on the basis of global 3D chemistry-transport and radiative transfer calculations. These indicate an enhancement of the direct radiative effect by about 30%, in agreement with previous work The contribution of CH(4) (direct and indirect effects) to climate forcing during the past 150 years is 0.57 W m(-2) (direct 0.44 W m(-2), indirect 0.13 W m(-2)). This is about 35% of the climate forcing by CO(2) (6 W m(-2)) and about 22% of the forcing by all long-lived greenhouse gases (2.6 W m(-2)). Scenario calculations (IPCC-IS92a) indicate that the CH(4) lifetime in the atmosphere increased by about 25-30% during the past 150 years to a current value of 7.9 years. Future lifetime changes are expected to be much smaller, about 6%, mostly due to the expected increase of tropospheric O(3) (-->OH) in the tropics. The global mean concentration of CH(4) may increase to about 2.55 mu mol/mol, its lifetime is expected to increase to 8.4 years in the year 2050. Further, we have calculated a CH(4) global warming potential (GWP) of 21 (kgCH(4)/kgCO(2)) over a time horizon of 100 years, in agreement with IPCC (1996). Scenario calculations indicate that the importance of the climate forcing by CH(4) (including indirect effects) relative to that of CO(2) will decrease in future; currently this is about 35%, while this is expected to decrease to about 15% in the year 2050.",1
"During the last decade, there have been remarkable changes in food waste management in Korea following a ban on direct landfilling. To evaluate the environmental impacts of food waste management systems, we examined individual treatment systems with the LCA approach - landfill, incineration, composting, and feed manufacturing - and estimated the change from 1997 to 2005. The efficient system was different in each impact category, but it was evaluated that landfill is the main contributor to human toxicity and global warming (based on fossil (CO2). In contrast, due to the increase of food waste recycling, acidification, eutrophication, and fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity impact was increased. Especially, the high energy consumption and generated residue in recycling systems caused the large burdens in toxicity categories. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"We used outputs from climate models that participated in the fourth assessment (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to evaluate the responses of the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) circulations to different warming over land and ocean under a medium warming scenario, SRES A1B. Our results suggest that, even though near-surface warming over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is greater than that over the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) and the northwestern Pacific (NWP), the upper-tropospheric land-sea thermal contrasts between the TP and the TIO (TP-TIO) and between the TP and the NWP (TP-NWP) will decrease. At interdecadal and longer time scales, the change in the SASM circulation is consistent with the TP-TIO upper-troposphere thermal contrast. Conversely, the change in the EASM circulation is consistent with the TP-NWP lower-troposphere thermal contrast. However, at the interannual time scale, both changes in the EASM and SASM are significantly correlated with the upper-troposphere thermal contrast. Further analyses suggest that increases in moisture and changes in cloud cover induced by global warming may cause amplified upper-tropospheric warming over the TP and the oceans resulting in inconsistent changes in the vertical temperature distribution over these regions. Because the warming over the TIO and NWP is greater than that over the TP, the TP-TIO meridional and TP-NWP zonal thermal contrasts will both decrease. However, at the lower layer, the difference in thermal capacity between land and sea result in a larger thermal effect in the near-surface region of the TP than those over the surrounding oceans. We showed that a range of factors that affect thermal conditions will likely cause changes in the Asian monsoon across a range of time scales under a warming scenario. These changes reflect differences in the influence of the greenhouse effect and natural variability.",1
"Promoting the use of renewable sources of energy is part of the efforts being undertaken to tackle the problem of global warming due to the greenhouse effect. Generation of heat or energy by wood combustion takes advantage of a renewable and often locally available source of energy and can help to reduce the overall emissions of CO2. Particularly small wood-fired appliances, however, are significant sources of air pollution. In addition to CO2 VOC or NOx, high emissions of particulate matter are a major drawback of these appliances. The work presented here results from efforts to improve small heating appliances burning solid fuel. For application in small heating systems, a compact and inexpensive solution that still offers a significant reduction of particle emissions is required. In this paper, a specific design of electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is presented and its collection efficiency and electrical characteristics are evaluated. Different geometries and electrode set-ups have been considered with the aim of developing a system that can also be retrofitted to existing installations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"In a variety of medical and industrial uses, small amounts of perfluorodecalin (C(10)F(18)) may have been released into the environment. However, it may significantly contribute to the global warming due to its highly radiative efficiency and global warming potential (GWP). Using the chemical similarity approach, this article aimed at calculating the fate properties and discussing the environmental implications of the perfluorinated compound for the purpose of mitigating its emissions. The environmental fate properties of perfluorodecalin, including octanol-water partition coefficient, water solubility and Henry's law constant, were first estimated in the present study. These predicted values were further compared with those of other chemically similar compounds such as naphthalene, decalin and decane. From the computational findings, perfluorodecalin, which has exceptionally low solubility in water and high vaporization from the water bodies, tends to be hydrophobic and partitioned into organic matter, suggesting that it will sink into the atmosphere. Also addressed in the paper was a possible proposal for forming trifluoroacetic acid in the atmosphere by the ionized photolysis of perfluorodecalin.",1
"In terrestrial records from Central and Eastern Europe the end of the Last Interglacial seems to be characterized by evident climatic and environmental instabilities recorded by geochemical and vegetation indicators. The transition (MIS 5e/5d) from the Last Interglacial (Eemian, Mikulino) to the Early Last Glacial (Early Weichselian, Early Valdai) is marked by at least two warming events as observed in geochemical data on the lake sediment profiles of Central (Grobern, Neumark-Nord, Klinge) and of Eastern Europe (Ples). Results of palynological studies of all these sequences indicate simultaneously a strong increase of environmental oscillations during the very end of the Last Interglacial and the beginning of the Last Glaciation. This paper discusses possible correlations of these events between regions in Central and Eastern Europe. The pronounced climate and environment instability during the interglacial/glacial transition could be consistent with the assumption that it is about a natural phenomenon, characteristic for transitional stages. Taking into consideration that Currently observed ""human-induced"" global warming coincides with the natural trend to cooling, the study Of Such transitional stages is important for understanding the underlying processes of the climate changes.

"Palaeoceanographic data have been used to suggest that methane hydrates play a significant role in global climate change. The mechanism by which methane is released during periods of global warming is, however, poorly understood(1). In particular, the size and role of the free-gas zone below gas-hydrate provinces remain relatively unconstrained, largely because the base of the free-gas zone is not a phase boundary and has thus defied systematic description. Here we evaluate the possibility that the maximum thickness of an interconnected free-gas zone is mechanically regulated by valving caused by fault slip in overlying sediments(2). Our results suggest that a critical gas column exists below most hydrate provinces in basin settings, implying that these provinces are poised for mechanical failure and are therefore highly sensitive to changes in ambient conditions(3). We estimate that the global free-gas reservoir may contain from one-sixth to two-thirds of the total methane trapped in hydrate(4). If gas accumulations are critically thick along passive continental slopes, we calculate that a 5 degreesC temperature increase at the sea floor could result in a release of similar to2,000 Gt of methane from the free-gas zone, offering a mechanism for rapid methane release during global warming events.",1
"Carbon content in soils changes depending on the land use system, type of management practice and time. There is an increasing concern about the soil quality vis-a-vis organic carbon content in soils due to global warming and enhanced CO(2) concentration in the atmosphere. This has led to estimate carbon stock in soils at global and regional levels. The objective of the present study was to evaluate RothC model to estimate total organic carbon (TOC) changes under four long term fertilizer experimental sites representing sub-humid moist (Sarol and Nabibagh), sub-humid dry (Panjri) and semi-arid (Teligi) climate in India. The plant carbon input rate was calibrated using organic carbon and other soil parameters using RothC. The results showed that RothC could simulate changes in TOC in two contrasting eco-sites for surface soil layers. The root mean square error (RMSE) considered as modelling error ranged from 150 to 15.01, 4.70 to 160, 2.14 to 6.52 and 45 to 13.74 in the surface layers of Sarol, Nabibagh, Panjri, and Teligi sites, respectively. The simulation biases expressed by M (relative error) by Student't' value for all the treatments at these sites were non-significant with two exceptions. Observed trends in TOC consist of an increase for all the four treatments in the sub-humid site of Sarol and Nabibagh; while manures alone or in combination increase TOC appreciably in Teligi and Panjri. TOC remained, however, almost similar over years for the control (no fertilizer or manure) and NPK treatments in all the four sites. Analysis of RothC output data showed that this model could be used as a tool to arrive at different threshold values of rainfall to influence decomposition rate modifier and thus to find out rate of organic carbon sequestration in various bioclimatic systems.

"The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated with anthropogenic climate change are widely known. Here, the additional role of poor water quality in lowering the thermal tolerance (i.e. bleaching 'resistance') of symbiotic reef corals is considered. In particular, a quantitative linkage is established between terrestrially-sourced dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) loading and the upper thermal bleaching thresholds of inshore reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Significantly, this biophysical linkage provides concrete evidence for the oft-expressed belief that improved coral reef management will increase the regional-scale survival prospects of corals reefs to global climate change. Indeed, for inshore reef areas with a high runoff exposure risk, it is shown that the potential benefit of this 'local' management imperative is equivalent to similar to 2.0-2.5 degrees C in relation to the upper thermal bleaching limit; though in this case, a potentially cost-prohibitive reduction in end-of-river DIN of >50-80% would be required. An integrated socio-economic modelling framework is outlined that will assist future efforts to understand (optimise) the alternate tradeoffs that the water quality/coral bleaching linkage presents.

"The global warming of Earth's near-surface, air and oceans in recent decades is a direct consequence of anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere such as CO2, CH4, N2O and CFCs. The CO2 emissions contribute approximately 60% to this climate change. This study investigates experimentally the aqueous carbonation mechanisms of an alkaline paper mill waste containing about 55 wt% portlandite (Ca(OH)(2)) as a possible mineralogical CO2 sequestration process. The overall carbonation reaction includes the following steps: (I) Ca release from portlandite dissolution, (2) CO2 dissolution in water and (3) CaCO3 precipitation. This CO2 sequestration mechanism was supported by geochemical modelling of final solutions using PHREEQC software, and observations by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction of final reaction products. According to the experimental protocol, the system proposed Would favour the total capture of approx. 218 kg Of CO2 into stable calcite/ton of paper waste, independently of initial CO2 pressure. The final product from the carbonation process is a calcite (ca. 100wt%)-water dispersion. Indeed, the total captured CO2 mineralized as calcite could be Stored in degraded soils or even used for diverse industrial applications. This result demonstrates the possibility of using the alkaline liquid-solid waste for CO2 mitigation and reduction of greenhouse effect gases into the atmosphere. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Aims. To describe the areas of potential dengue fever risk in New Zealand for present climatic conditions and projected scenarios of climate change. Methods. A computer model, the HOTSPOTS System, was developed. This allowed the integration of climatic, topographical, entomological, demographic, trade and travel data to generate spatial information describing vector introduction risk, potential vector distribution and dengue fever risk. Results. Under present climatic conditions, Auckland and Northland, and some coastal areas of other northern parts of the North Island, have a potential risk for dengue outbreaks supported by the vector Aedes albopictus. Greenhouse gas induced climate change could make these areas also receptive to Aedes aegpti-the more efficient tropical dengue vector-and increase the potential distribution of A. albopictus to much of the South Island. Conclusions. Given the introduction of a competent vector, there is an appreciable risk of dengue fever occurring in New Zealand under present climatic conditions. Greenhouse gas induced climate change would substantially increase the magnitude and spatial extent of this risk.",1
"Used lubricating oil (ULO) is among those difficult-to-handle anthropogenic pollutants due to its toxicity and handling difficulty. The selection of proper abatement technologies for ULO depends significantly on the appropriateness of the technology not only in technical terms, but also in environmental points of view. In the present work, six management scenarios for the management of ULO were evaluated for their environmental impacts based on life cycle approach. Two of them, i.e. acid clay and solvent extraction are the treatment processes for the recovery of ULO and the main product from these processes is recycled used oil. The other four scenarios, i.e. small boiler, vaporizing burner boiler, atomizing burner boiler, and cement kiln, are to generate energy from ULO. Emissions were characterized into four environmental impact categories: global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and heavy metals. The acid clay process, which has generally been believed to generate high environmental load, actually produced high environmental impact only in terms of acidification. Cement kiln created the lowest impact in terms of global warming potential and heavy metals. This was due to high temperature in cement kiln which could rightly allow the complete combustion of organic compounds in ULO whereas other contaminants such as heavy metals were captured in mortar during the cement reaction.

"Carbonate crusts in marine environments can act as sinks for carbon dioxide. Therefore, understanding carbonate crust formation could be important for understanding global warming. In the present study, the microbial communities of three carbonate crust samples from deep-sea mud volcanoes in the eastern Mediterranean were characterized by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes amplified from DNA directly retrieved from the samples. In combination with the mineralogical composition of the crusts and lipid analyses, sequence data were used to assess the possible role of prokaryotes in crust formation. Collectively, the obtained data showed the presence of highly diverse communities, which were distinct in each of the carbonate crusts studied. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were found in all crusts and the majority was classified as alpha-, gamma-, and delta- Proteobacteria. Interestingly, sequences of Proteobacteria related to Halomonas and Halovibrio sp., which can play an active role in carbonate mineral formation, were present in all crusts. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from two of the crusts studied. Several of those were closely related to archaeal sequences of organisms that have previously been linked to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). However, the majority of archaeal sequences were not related to sequences of organisms known to be involved in AOM. In combination with the strongly negative delta C-13 values of archaeal lipids, these results open the possibility that organisms with a role in AOM may be more diverse within the Archaea than previously suggested. Different communities found in the crusts could carry out similar processes that might play a role in carbonate crust formation.",1
"In this study, paddy fields in Jilin province which are flooded parcel of arable lands used for growing rice (Oryza sativa Linn.) were selected as the object. Long-term exploitation of paddy fields led to variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and green house gases (GHGs) emissions which might contribute to global warming. In order to calculate the amount of global warming potentials (GWPs) of emissions from ricepaddies and find the correlations among rice yield, SOC storage and GWP, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to simulate SOC densities and fluxes of main GHGs emitted from paddy fields. After verification, simulation results were used to calculate SOC storages and 100-year GWPs from 1949 to 2009. Results indicated that SOC densities in depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm all kept increasing. Average methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) fluxes were 278.55 kg carbon (kgC) ha(-1) a(-1) and 2.22 kg nitrogen (kgN) ha(-1) a(-1). The SOC storage (0-30 cm) had increased from 3.96x10(9)kgC in 1949 to 47.85x 10(9)kgC in 2009. In addition, GWP emission was increasing exponentially in the past 61 years, from 0.16x10(6) Mg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)-equivalents) to 66.36x10(6) Mg CO(2)-equivalents. Both SOC storage and GWP presented obviously linear relation to rice yields. Overall, the research suggested that long-term rice yields could be used to estimate the SOC storage and GWP variations.",1
"Environmental scientists from federal agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and academia have long suspected that increasing anthropogenic inputs of various trace gases into the atmosphere can cause changes in the earth's climate and protective ozone layer. Nitrous oxide and methane, cited in the Kyoto Protocol, as well as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), cited in the Montreal Protocol, are all greenhouse gases and are implicated in the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. The lack of national standards prompted research to determine the feasibility of preparing accurate and stable standards containing these four compounds. Development of these standards would support the measurement of these species by those in the atmospheric research community not having their own source of standards. A suite of eight primary gas standards containing methane, nitrous oxide, CFC-11, and CFC-12 in a balance of air were prepared gravimetrically to bracket the ambient atmospheric concentrations. The combined uncertainties (u(c)) were calculated from error propagation analysis that included the weighing data from the gravimetric preparation and other sources of error such as the purity analysis of the compounds and air matrix. The expanded uncertainties (U) for the gravimetric standards were <0.5% as calculated from the equation U = ku(c), where the coverage factor k is equal to 2 for a 95% confidence interval. Analyses of the suite of standards by gas chromatography with flame-ionization and electron capture detection resulted in average absolute residuals of <0.25% from regression models. The NIST suite of eight gravimetric standards was used to determine the concentrations in two standards from NOAA. Those analyses resulted in bias across the two laboratories of less than or equal to2.1%.",1
"Organic agriculture addresses the public demand to diminish environmental pollution of agricultural production. Until now, however, only few studies tried to determine the integrated environmental impact of conventional versus organic production using life cycle assessment (LCA). The aim of this article was to review prospects and constraints of LCA as a tool to assess the integrated environmental impact of conventional and organic animal production. This aim was illustrated using results from LCAs in the literature and from a pilot study comparing conventional and organic milk production. This review shows that LCAs of different case studies currently cannot be compared directly. Such a comparison requires further international standardisation of the LCA method. A within-case-study comparison of LCAs of conventional and organic production, however, appeared suitable to gain knowledge and to track down main differences in potential environmental impact. Acidification potential of milk production, for example, is for 78-97% due to volatilisation of ammonia, which is not reduced necessarily by changing from conventional to organic milk production. Eutrophication potential per tonne of milk or per ha of farmland was lower for organic than for conventional milk production due to lower fertiliser application rates. Global warming potential of milk production is for 48-65% due to emission of methane. Organic milk production inherently increases methane emission and, therefore, can reduce global warming potential only by reducing emission of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide considerably. Organic milk production reduces pesticide use, whereas it increases land use per tonne of milk. Conclusions regarding potential environmental impact of organic versus conventional milk production, however, are based largely on comparison of experimental farms. To show differences in potential environmental impact among various production systems, however, LCAs should be performed at a large number of practical farms for each production system of interest. Application of LCA on practical farms, however, requires in-depth research to understand underlying processes, and to predict, or measure, variation in emissions realised in practice.

"With the recent developments in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers it is becoming more feasible to place these instruments in field environments. As a result, there has been enormous increase in the use of FTIR techniques for a variety of qualitative and quantitative chemical measurements. These methods offer the possibility of fully automated real-time quantitation of many analytes; therefore FTIR has great potential as an analytical tool. Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA) has developed protocol methods for emissions monitoring using both extractive and open-path FTIR measurements. Depending upon the analyte, the experimental conditions and the analyte matrix, approximately 100 of the hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the 1990 U.S.EPA Clean Air Act amendment (CAAA) can be measured. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a program to provide quality-assured infrared absorption coefficient data based on NIST prepared primary gas standards. Currently, absorption coefficient data has been acquired for approximately 20 of the HAPs. For each compound, the absorption coefficient spectrum was calculated using nine transmittance spectra at 0.12 cm(-1) resolution and the Beer's law relationship. The uncertainties in the absorption coefficient data were estimated from the linear regressions of the transmittance data and considerations of other error sources such as the nonlinear detector response. For absorption coefficient values greater than 1 x 10(-4) mu mol/mol)(-1) m(-1) the average relative expanded uncertainty is 2.2 %. This quantitative infrared database is currently an ongoing project at NIST. Additional spectra will be added;to the database as they are acquired. Our current plans include continued data acquisition of the compounds listed in the CAAA, as well as the compounds that contribute to global warming and ozone depletion.",1
"Perfluorocompounds (PFCs) have been extensively used as plasma etching and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) gases for semiconductor manufacturing processes. PFCs have significant effects on the global warming and have very long atmospheric lifetimes. Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of CF4 conversion by using dielectric barrier discharges (DBD). The results of this study revealed that the removal efficiency of CF4 increased with application of higher voltage, gas residence lime, oxygen content, and frequency. Combined plasma catalysis (CPC) is an innovative way for abatement of PFC and experimental results indicated that combining plasma with catalysts could effectively remove CF4. Products were analyzed by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the major products of the CF4 processing with DBD were CO2, COF2, and CO, when O was included in the discharge process. Preliminary results indicated that as high as 65.9% of CF4,vas decomposed with CPC operated at 15 kV, 240 Hz for the gas stream containing 300 ppmv CF4, 20% by volume O-2, and 40% by volume Ar, with N-2 as the carrier gas.",1
"Rice production is a substantial source of atmospheric CH(4), which is second only to CO(2) as a contributor to global warming. Since CH(4) is produced in anaerobic soil environments, water management is expected to be a practical measure to mitigate CH(4) emissions. In this study, we used a process-based biogeochemistry model (DNDC-Rice) to assess the CH(4) mitigation potentials of alternative water regimes (AWR) for rice fields at a regional scale. Before regional application, we tested DNDC-Rice using site-scale data from three rice fields in Japan with different water regimes. The observed CH(4) emissions were reduced by drainage of the fields, but were enhanced by organic amendments. DNDC-Rice gave acceptable predictions of variation in daily CH(4) fluxes and seasonal CH(4) emissions due to changes in the water regime. For regional application, we constructed a GIS database at a 1 x 1 km mesh scale that contained data on rice field area, soil properties, daily weather, and farming management of each cell in the mesh, covering 3.2% of the rice fields in Japan's Hokkaido region. We ran DNDC-Rice to simulate CH(4) emissions under five simulated water regimes: the conventional water regime and four AWR scenarios with gradually increasing drainage. We found that AWR can reduce CH(4) emission by up to 41% compared with the emission under conventional water regime. Including the changes in CO(2) and nitrous oxide emissions, potential mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) was 2.6 Mg CO(2) Eq. ha-1 yr- If this estimate is expanded to Japan's total rice fields, expected GHG mitigation is 4.3 Tg CO(2) Eq. yr-1, which accounts for 0.32% of total GHG emissions from Japan. For a reliable national-scale assessment, however, databases on soil, weather, and farming management must be constructed at a national scale, as these factors are widely variable between regions in Japan.",1
"Increased anthropogenic CO(2) emissions in the last two centuries have lead to rising sea surface temperature and falling ocean pH, and it is predicted that current global trends will worsen over the next few decades. There is limited understanding of how genetic variation among individuals will influence the responses of populations and species to these changes. A microcosm system was set up to study the effects of predicted temperature and CO(2) levels on the bryozoan Celleporella hyalina. In this marine species, colonies grow by the addition of male, female and feeding modular individuals (zooids) and can be physically subdivided to produce a clone of genetically identical colonies. We studied colony growth rate (the addition of zooids), reproductive investment (the ratio of sexual to feeding zooids) and sex ratio (male to female zooids) in four genetically distinct clonal lines. There was a significant effect of clone on growth rate, reproductive investment and sex ratio, with clones showing contrasting responses to the various temperature and pH combinations. Overall, decreasing pH and increasing temperature caused reduction of growth, and eventual cessation of growth was often observed at the highest temperature, especially during the latter half of the 15-day trials. Reproductive investment increased with increasing temperature and decreasing pH, varying more widely with temperature at the lowest pH. The increased production of males, a general stress response of the bryozoan, was seen upon exposure to reduced pH, but was not expressed at the highest temperature tested, presumably due to the frequent cessation of growth. Further to the significant effect of pH on the measured whole-colony parameters, observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed surface pitting of the calcified exoskeleton in colonies that were exposed to increased acidity. Studying ecologically relevant processes of growth and reproduction, we demonstrate the existence of relevant levels of variation among genetic individuals which may enable future adaptation via non-mutational natural selection to falling pH and rising temperature.",1
"Sugarcane growers can make disproportionately large contributions to the great global issues of carbon sequestration to combat global warming, and to the provisioning (in the broadest sense) of the burgeoning populations of Africa and S/SE Asia. The key to both is a substantial increase of Soil Organic Matter (SOM); increasing levels worldwide by one-third would deplete atmospheric CO(2) levels to near zero. Sugarcane growers can play their part through embracing trash mulching and minimum tillage; but additional field experiments are needed to define best techniques. Increased SOM will improve yields and water-use efficiencies, and reduce erosion. The ultimate development of increasing SOM and, thus, fertility is the burying of biochar, a technology that has been demonstrated (the terra preta soils) in Amazonia for over a millennium. The sugar industry is exceptionally well placed to promote the use of biochar - albeit on a scale which would probably be limited to ""garden"" type food crops - as it has the required expertise and ""extension"" staff, and the raw materials (waste cellulosic material and nutrients such as filter mud and molasses). The use of sugarcane as a biofuel seems to be successful in Brazil, but that technology is not necessarily appropriate to different socio-economic environments. Small scale charcoal producing plants, based on cane trash or bagasse, could have a major economic impact in poorer countries, and would help to prevent deforestation. Again, the sugar industry has the expertise and resources to promote such technology.",1
"Different solid waste management system scenarios were developed and compared for the Municipal Solid Waste Management System of Ankara by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The solid waste management methods considered in the scenarios were collection and transportation of wastes, source reduction, Material Recovery Facility (MRF)/Transfer Stations (TS), incineration, anaerobic digestion and landfilling. The goal of the study was to determine the most environmentally friendly option of MSWM system for Ankara. The functional unit of the study was the amount of solid waste generated in the system area of concern, which are the districts of Ankara. The life cycle inventory analysis was carried out by IWM Model- The inputs and outputs of each management stage were defined and the inventory emissions calculated by the model were classified in to impact categories; non-renewable energy sources exhausting potential, final solid waste as hazardous and nonhazardous, global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity. The impacts were quantified with the weighing factors of each category to develop the environmental profiles of each scenario. In most of the categories, Source Reduction Scenario was found to be the most feasible management method, except the global warming category. The lowest contribution to G-AT was calculated for the anaerobic digestion process. In the interpretation and improvement assessment stage, the results were further evaluated and recommendations were made to improve the current solid waste management system of Ankara.

"Adaptation in response to anthropogenic climate change seeks to maintain viability by maximising benefits and minimising losses. It is necessary because some climatic change is now inevitable, despite the international focus on mitigation measures. Indeed, the measures agreed at Kyoto would by themselves result in only a small reduction in the climate changes to be expected over the next century. Discussion of the expected changes and possible impacts leads to the following conclusions regarding climate change scenarios in relation to impacts and adaptation: Climate change in the foreseeable future will not be some new stable ""equilibrium"" climate, but rather an ongoing ""transient"" process; Climate change predictions relevant to impacts on most sectors and ecosystems are still highly uncertain; There is a need for a greater focus on developing countries and tropical regions, and on relevant key variables, including the magnitude and frequency of extreme events; The focus should shift from single predictions, or extreme ranges of uncertainty, to risk assessment; Thresholds critical to impacted sectors and ecosystems should be identified, and expressed as functions of climatic variables; Planned adaptations will be necessary to cope with multiple stresses, including those due to non-climatic changes; A major task of adaptation science is to identify the limits of adaptation, i.e., to identify ""dangerous levels of greenhouse gases"" beyond which adaptation becomes impractical or prohibitively expensive.",1
"In this paper, we give some results of an investigation into the climate system sensitivity to small external forcings. We analyse the response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide content in 18 climate models involved in the CMIP program. It is shown that of vital importance in the total response is its radiative component. Moreover, a significant contribution is made by a dynamical response whose main component is the Arctic Oscillation. We describe the method of calculating the operator of the dynamical response of climate models and the real climate system to these external forcings (the calculation of the first moment perturbation). It is shown that the approximate response operator allows one to reproduce both the value and the spatial structure of the linear part of the response of the atmospheric general circulation model with high accuracy. The external forcing optimally exciting the Arctic Oscillation is constructed by the observational data and the results of modelling. It is shown that the radiative response of climate models to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide content is mainly due to an amount of heat used for warming up the ocean and the extent to which the radiation balance of the Earth varies due to cloudiness change as the climate changes. In models predicting the large value of the global warming the short-wave radiation balance on the surface generally increases, whereas the small value of the global warming corresponds to the decrease of the short-wave radiation balance. We discuss the dependence of the value of the global warming, as the carbon dioxide content increases, on the geographical distribution of the incoming short-wave radiation as well as the correction of a heat flux when modelling the present-day climate. Using this dependence, we estimate the expected value of the global warming, as the carbon dioxide content increases, for the real climate system.",1
"Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere next to carbon dioxide. Its global warming potential (GWP) for a time horizon of 100 years is 25, which makes it an attractive target for climate mitigation policies. Although the methane GWP traditionally includes the methane indirect effects on the concentrations of ozone and stratospheric water vapour, it does not take into account the production of carbon dioxide from methane oxidation. We argue here that this CO(2)-induced effect should be included for fossil sources of methane, which results in slightly larger GWP values for all time horizons. If the global temperature change potential is used as an alternative climate metric, then the impact of the CO(2)-induced effect is proportionally much larger. We also discuss what the correction term should be for methane from anthropogenic biogenic sources.",1
"The Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) coincided with a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in carbonate and organic matter, in terrestrial and marine records. Consequently the PETM global warming of 5-6 degrees C has been attributed to the rapid emission of a large amount of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system, and the magnitude of the CIE has been used to estimate the amount of carbon greenhouse gas emitted. However, there are large discrepancies between the magnitude of the CIE in marine and in terrestrial material, in different types of marine carbonate records (bulk carbonate, planktic and benthic foraminiferal carbonate), and in marine carbonate records from different locations. The marine carbonate record of the CIE may be incomplete in most deep-sea (bathyal-abyssal) locations because of ocean acidification and widespread dissolution of seafloor carbonates. We demonstrate that the CIE in benthic foraminiferal stable isotope records is relatively abrupt and not as gradual as portrayed in bulk carbonate records along the Walvis Ridge depth transect (SE Atlantic). The benthic CIE is about -5 parts per thousand at 3600 m paleodepth, in contrast to about -3.5 parts per thousand at 1500 m paleodepth, consistent with depth-dependent truncation by carbonate dissolution. Strong covariance between the benthic record and the stable carbon isotope values of terrestrial n-alkanes isolated from the same core (i.e., Site 1263) supports a relatively rapid excursion of at least -3.5 parts per thousand but no more than -5.0 parts per thousand.",1
"While the parties to the UNFCCC agreed in the December 2009 Copenhagen Accord that a 2 degrees C global warming over pre-industrial levels should be avoided, current commitments on greenhouse gas emissions reductions from these same parties will lead to a 50 : 50 chance of warming greater than 3.5 degrees C. Here, we evaluate the differences in impacts and adaptation issues for water resources in worlds corresponding to the policy objective (+2 degrees C) and possible reality (+4 degrees C). We simulate the differences in impacts on surface run-off and water resource availability using a global hydrological model driven by ensembles of climate models with global temperature increases of 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C. We combine these with UN-based population growth scenarios to explore the relative importance of population change and climate change for water availability. We find that the projected changes in global surface run-off from the ensemble show an increase in spatial coherence and magnitude for a +4 degrees C world compared with a +2 degrees C one. In a +2 degrees C world, population growth in most large river basins tends to override climate change as a driver of water stress, while in a +4 degrees C world, climate change becomes more dominant, even compensating for population effects where climate change increases runoff. However, in some basins where climate change has positive effects, the seasonality of surface run-off becomes increasingly amplified in a +4 degrees C climate.",1
"The gradient (ordination) analysis was used to find the tendencies and the rate of changes in discrete parameters of the cycle of forest phytomasses accompanying a growing thermoarid climatic trend. The prognostic estimates of biotic regulation of the carbon cycle by forest biogeocenoses according to the HadCM3 (version A2) climatic scenarios, describing the most powerful coming global warming, are presented.",1
"Global warming is affecting agribusiness in its economic aspects. Therefore, the prediction of the evolution of Brazilian beef cattle production cost was made using the IPCC forecast scenario for global warming. The methodology consisted of two steps: (i) the development of a fuzzy model that estimated the grazing land capacity (RP) decrease risk as a function of the changes in the average total rain index, air temperature and increase in extension of the dry season; and (ii) the design of an algorithm for predicting the decrease in production as function of the RP fuzzy model, that results in the impact in beef cattle productivity, and consequent increase in production costs. Historical environmental data from important producing counties in the Cerrado were organized and a set of fuzzy Gaussian functions were developed, and three possible settings (optimistic, medium and pessimistic) were considered. The decrease in beef cattle productivity was estimated using the losses in production due to the increase in air temperature and vulnerability of pasture capacity. The boundary settings for the total increase of production cost scenario used the number of animals per area of grazing land, the adoption of grain supplement and its future scenario; and the result output function pointed to a threshold within a variation from an increase in production cost of 80% (optimistic) to 160% (pessimistic). Under the optimistic scenario the total cost of Brazilian beef cattle production in the Cerrado became near to US$ 2.88 kg(-1), while in the pessimistic scenario this cost reached US$ 4.16 kg(-1), challenging the international competitiveness of this economic segment.",1
"Increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to induce significant climate change over the next century and beyond, but the impacts on society remain highly uncertain. This work examines potential climate change impacts on the productivity of five major crops in eastern China: canola, corn, potato, rice, and winter wheat. In addition to determining domain-wide trends, the objective is to identify vulnerable and emergent regions under future climate conditions, defined as having a greater than 10% decrease and increase in productivity, respectively. Data from the ICTP RegCM3 regional climate model for baseline (1961-1990) and future (2071-2100) periods under A2 scenario conditions are used as input for the EPIC agro-ecosystem simulation model in the domain [30 degrees N, 108 degrees E] to [42 degrees N, 123 degrees E]. Simulations are performed with and without the enhanced CO2-fertilization effect. Results indicate that aggregate potential productivity (i.e. if the crop is grown everywhere) increases 6.5% for rice, 8.3% for canola, 18.6% for corn, 22.9% for potato, and 24.9% for winter wheat, although with significant spatial variability for each crop. However, without the enhanced CO2-fertilization effect, potential productivity declines in all cases ranging from 2.5 to 12%. Interannual yield variability remains constant or declines in all cases except rice. Climate variables are found to be more significant drivers of simulated yield changes than changes in soil properties, except in the case of potato production in the northwest where the effects of wind erosion are more significant. Overall, in the future period corn and winter wheat benefit significantly in the North China Plain, rice remains dominant in the southeast and emerges in the northeast, potato and corn yields become viable in the northwest, and potato yields suffer in the southwest with no other crop emerging as a clear beneficiary from among those simulated in this study.

"As we step further into the 21st century, the demand for sustainable energy-efficient technology grows higher. The important area of electric lighting, currently dominated by decades-old incandescent and fluorescent sources, is being taken over by white light emitting diodes, which are solid state devices with much greater energy savings. Replacement of current inefficient lighting by these LEDs will result in reduction of global carbon dioxide emissions, a major cause of global warming, among other things. WLEDs hold the potential, in the field of photonics, to be as transformational as the transistor was in electronics. This core device has the potential to revolutionize how we use light, including not only for illumination, but also for communications, sensing, navigation, imaging, and many more applications. In this tutorial we highlight some of the potentials.",1
"The extent, and variability of seasonal snow cover are important parameters in the climate system. Changes in snow cover may provide an indicator of global climatic trends and are of considerable practical significance. The question of the most suitable indices of changes in snow cover conditions, in terms of their use for change detection and for monitoring applications, is discussed. The use of passive microwave-derived estimates of snow cover extent and water equivalent for continental and regional-scale mapping is illustrated. Problems in interpreting the microwave signatures, as well as difficulties in comparing such data to ground observations, are also noted. Up to now analyses have focused primarily on trends in Northern Hemisphere snow extent based on monthly averages using the NOAA weekly snow charts 1972-present, or on station data spanning 50-100 years. However, the latter are generally less readily available, or accessible. An overview is provided of current information on recent hemispheric trends and, for the former USSR, the relationship of changes in snow depth, to variations in temperature and precipitation since the late nineteenth century are described, based on newly available station records. Interpretation of these changes and comparisons with other records are presented. Model projections of changes in snow cover conditions and associated snowmelt runoff that may occur as a result of greenhouse gas-induced warming are discussed for several mountain regions. Long-term station records of snow depth variability provided a valuable context within which such modeling results can be examined.",1
"The combustion of fossil fuels emits a range of damaging pollutants, the emissions of which are reduced if fossil fuel use is reduced in order to achieve CO2 abatement. These reductions are termed the secondary benefits of such abatement. The paper reviews estimates of the size of these benefits. Although the estimates are few and uncertain, they uniformly suggest that the secondary benefits are of the same order of magnitude as the gross costs of medium to high levels of CO2 abatement, and are substantially larger than the (equally uncertain) estimates of the primary benefits of CO2 abatement, except where these benefits derive from consideration of damages from unabated global warming in the very long term. The paper concludes that the existence of significant secondary benefits greatly reinforces the economic case for an aggressive policy of CO2 abatement.",1
"In order to attempt to eliminate global warming effects, it is highly desirable that new technologies with lower or zero emission of CO2 to the environment are developed. In this work, a high-pressure fluidized-bed coal gasifier for H-2 production with in situ fixation of CO2 is simulated by a comprehensive two-dimensional model. The Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) model is first adopted in the pulverized coal gasification model to simultaneously describe the turbulent mixing and detailed chemical kinetics. The developed model is verified with experimental results. The simulated concentrations for the gas product agree well with the experimental data. The simulated distributions for gas temperature and velocity correlate well with the reaction mechanism and experimental phenomena.",1
"The statistical spatial-temporal features of the intense snowfall event (ISE) in China are investigated over the period of 1962-2000. The results indicate that eastern China, northern Xinjiang, the eastern Tibetan plateau, and northeastern China are four key regions for the ISE, with more frequency and strong variability. Annual cycle analysis shows the ISE exhibits a unimodal distribution with maximum frequency at winter months for eastern China, a bimodal distribution with maximum frequency at early winter and spring months for northern Xinjiang and northeastern China, and a bimodal distribution with maximum frequency at autumn and spring months for the eastern Tibetan plateau. Linear trend analysis indicates that in the last 39 years, the ISE exhibits a decreasing trend for eastern China and an increasing trend for northern Xinjiang and the eastern Tibetan plateau. The linear trend of the ISE is weak over northeastern China. Based on the simulations of the most recent and comprehensive climate models in the 20th century run, the performance of the current climate models in simulating the Chinese ISE is investigated. The results indicate that, of the 20 models, there are four models that can reasonably reproduce the spatial-temporal features of the Chinese ISE. Based on these four models' simulation for the 21st century under A1B and A2 scenarios, the future variability of the Chinese ISE is projected. It is found that global warming will cause the ISE frequency over southern China to decrease, while the ISE over northern China will initially increase and then decrease.",1
"Alpine snowbeds are characterized by a long-lasting snow cover and low soil temperature during the growing season. Both these key abiotic factors controlling plant life in snowbeds are sensitive to anthropogenic climate change and will alter the environmental conditions in snowbeds to a considerable extent until the end of this century. In order to name winners and losers of climate change among the plant species inhabiting snowbeds, we analyzed the small-scale species distribution along the snowmelt and soil temperature gradients within alpine snowbeds in the Swiss Alps. The results show that the date of snowmelt and soil temperature were relevant abiotic factors for small-scale vegetation patterns within alpine snowbed communities. Species richness in snowbeds was reduced to about 50% along the environmental gradients towards later snowmelt date or lower daily maximum temperature. Furthermore, the occurrence pattern of the species along the snowmelt gradient allowed the establishment of five species categories with different predictions of their distribution in a warmer world. The dominants increased their relative cover with later snowmelt date and will, therefore, lose abundance due to climate change, but resist complete disappearance from the snowbeds. The indifferents and the transients increased in species number and relative cover with higher temperature and will profit from climate warming. The snowbed specialists will be the most suffering species due to the loss of their habitats as a consequence of earlier snowmelt dates in the future and will be replaced by the avoiders of late-snowmelt sites. These forthcoming profiteers will take advantage from an increasing number of suitable habitats due to an earlier start of the growing season and increased temperature. Therefore, the characteristic snowbed vegetation will change to a vegetation unit dominated by alpine grassland species. The study highlights the vulnerability of the established snowbed vegetation to climate change and requires further studies particularly about the role of biotic interactions in the predicted invasion and replacement process.",1
"In view of the depleting availability of water for agriculture, higher emission of nitrous oxide and methane from low land rice cultivation and their deleterious impact on global warming phenomenon, the present study stressed the need for cultivation of aerobic rice. The study focuses on identifying and mapping suitable sites in eastern India through computation of rice aridity index from soils and climatic data and proposing suitability criteria model and assessing potential yield. This study gains further significance since aerobic rice cultivation could improve the upland production efficiency and helps reduction of greenhouse gases.",1
"Recent increase in atmospheric concentration Of CO(2) and decrease in land-based sink capacity are attributed to numerous anthropogenic activities including increase in severity and extent of soil degradation and desertification. There is a strong link between desertification and global warming with positive feedback of mutual reinforcement. The biophysical process is also driven by social, economic, political, and cultural factors Such as overgrazing by local Bedouin population. Soil carbon (C) sequestration, through conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices, is more in cooler than warmer and higher in wetter than drier climates, and larger in clayey than sandy soils. It ranges front 0 to 200 kg C ha(-1) y(-1) in soils of semi-arid climate to 200-500 kg ha(-1) y(-1) in those of sub-humid climates. The rates may range from negative to a high of 1500 kg ha(-1) y(-1). In contrast, the rate of SIC sequestration as secondary carbonates are low and range from 5 to 15 kg C ha(-1) y(-1). In addition to proven technologies (e.g., low stocking rate, afforestaion, soil, and water conservation), there are numerous opportunities for using the modern innovations involving nanotechnology, biotechnology, and information technology. Trading of C credits, through Kyoto's CDM or World Bank's BioCarbon Fund and other mechanisms, opens new opportunities for promoting the use of terrestrial sinks. In this regards, desertificd ecosystems in Africa/Asia and elsewhere may benefit through C-sequestration programs because rehabilitation of degraded lands is an urgent matter of global importance, Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1
"The burning of fossil fuel is producing the greenhouse gas CO2 at a rate that is causing global warming and threatens to change the global environment adversely. One proposed solution involves sequestering in the deep sea a substantial portion of the excess CO2 produced. Because large areas would be affected and this environment harbors one of the world's largest reservoirs of biodiversity, the approach is controversial. In particular, deep-sea diversity is found largely in the animals that live in the sediment, but the effects of sequestered CO2 on these organisms are not known. We therefore introduced similar to 60 1 of liquid CO2 onto the seafloor at 3250 m depth and sampled similar to 2 and similar to 40 m from the deposition site 30 d later. The pore water in the samples taken near the site was 0.75 pH unit more acidic (pH decreases when CO2 concentration increases) than that in samples taken farther away, Representative infauna had been killed in significantly greater numbers in the former than in the latter location. This demonstration that sequestered CO2 can adversely affect the deep-sea infauna brings CO2 sequestration in the deep sea into potential conflict with the preservation of deep-sea biodiversity.",1
"Generating credible climate change and extremes projections remains a high-priority challenge, especially since recent observed emissions are above the worst-case scenario. Bias and uncertainty analyses of ensemble simulations from a global earth systems model show increased warming and more intense heat waves combined with greater uncertainty and large regional variability in the 21st century. Global warming trends are statistically validated across ensembles and investigated at regional scales. Observed heat wave intensities in the current decade are larger than worst-case projections. Model projections are relatively insensitive to initial conditions, while uncertainty bounds obtained by comparison with recent observations are wider than ensemble ranges. Increased trends in temperature and heat waves, concurrent with larger uncertainty and variability, suggest greater urgency and complexity of adaptation or mitigation decisions.",1
"Methane emitted from ruminant livestock is regarded as a loss of feed energy and also a contributor to global warming. Methane is synthesized in the rumen as one of the hydrogen sink products that are unavoidable for efficient succession of anaerobic microbial fermentation. Various attempts have been made to reduce methane emission, mainly through rumen microbial manipulation, by the use of agents including chemicals, antibiotics and natural products such as oils, fatty acids and plant extracts. A newer approach is the development of vaccines against methanogenic bacteria. While ionophore antibiotics have been widely used due to their efficacy and affordable prices, the use of alternative natural materials is becoming more attractive due to health concerns regarding antibiotics. An important feature of a natural material that constitutes a possible alternative methane inhibitor is that the material does not reduce feed intake or digestibility but does enhance propionate that is the major hydrogen sink alternative to methane. Some implications of these approaches, as well as an introduction to antibiotic-alternative natural materials and novel approaches, are provided.",1
"The diagrammatic representation of climate change, adaptation and mitigation is important in conceptualizing the problem, identifying important feedbacks, and communicating between disciplines. The Synthesis Report of the IPCC's Third Assessment Report, 2001, uses a ""cause and effect"" approach developed in the integrated assessment literature. This viewpoint reviews this approach and suggests an alternative, based on stocks and flows. The alternative gives a much richer representation of the problem so that it includes the enhanced greenhouse effect, ancillary benefits of mitigation, the distinction between climate-change and other stresses on natural systems, and a more refined distinction between adaptation and mitigation.

"Global warming risks from emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by anthropogenic activities have increased the need for the identification of ecosystems with high carbon sink capacity as an alternative mitigation strategy of terrestrial carbon sequestration. The agroforestry sector has received recent attention for its enormous potential carbon pools that reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The Nubra Valley (Trans-Himalayan region) is covered with more than 575,000 agroforestry plantations (willow and poplar). These species have been found to sequester more than 75,000 tonnes of carbon. Every year these plantations are contributing 400 tonnes of leaf litter to the ground, which is one of the best sources of soil organic carbon. This communication attempts to suggest some appropriate management practices to improve soil organic carbon pools by analysing available information of agroforestry plants in the Nubra Valley by quantification of biomass contribution by willow and poplar species within the valley and CO(2) sequestration rates by the living biomass.",1
"Global warming and loss of biodiversity are among the most prominent environmental issues of our time. Large sums are spent to reduce their causes, the emission of CO(2) and nitrogen compounds. However, the results of such measures are potentially conflicting, as the reduction of nitrogen deposition may hamper carbon sequestration and thus increase global warming. Moreover, it is uncertain whether a lower nitrogen deposition will lead to a higher biodiversity. We applied a dynamic soil model, a vegetation dynamic model and a biodiversity regression model to investigate the effect of nitrogen deposition reduction on the carbon sequestration and plant species diversity. The soil and vegetation models simulate the carbon sequestration as a result of nitrogen deposition and they provide the biodiversity model with information on the soil conditions groundwater table, pH and nitrogen availability. The plant diversity index resulting from the biodiversity model is based on the occurrence of 'red list' species for the tree soil conditions. Based on the model runs we forecast that a gradual decrease in nitrogen deposition from 40 to 10 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) in the next 25 years will cause a drop in the net carbon sequestration of forest in The Netherlands to 27% of the present amount, while biodiversity remains constant in forest, but may increase in heathland and grassland.

"There is growing concern over the emission and accumulation of very long-lived fluorinated trace gases in the atmosphere, due to their large global warming potentials (GWPs). Unlike CFCs and other ozone-depleting, chlorinated and brominated chemicals, consumption of these fluorinated compounds is not controlled by the Montreal Protocol or any other international agreement. Of all the known and potential trace 'greenhouse' gases, the two with the highest GWPs are sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and fluoroform (CHF3, HFC-23). Whereas several studies have reported the detection and accumulation of SF6 in the atmosphere, the presence of HFC-23 has remained unreported. We have found that present-day HFC-23 concentrations (c. 11 pptv in late 1995) exceed those of SF6 by a factor of three. Concentrations have steadily increased in the atmosphere since at least 1978, and are continuing to do so at a present rate of 5% per year. Furthermore, HFC-23 appears to be long-lived in the atmosphere, with a stratospheric lifetime of at least 1000 years, and a modelled tropospheric lifetime of 230 years. In terms of global warming, the cumulative emissions of HFC-23 up to, and including, 1995 are equivalent to 6 billion tonnes of CO2.",1
"Carbon sequestration in tropical soils has potential for mitigating global warming and increasing agricultural productivity. We analyzed 26 long-term experiments (LTEs) in different agro-climatic zones (ACZs) of India to assess the potential and cost of C sequestration. Data on initial and final soil organic C (SOC) concentration in the recommended N, P and K (NPK); recommended N, P and K plus farmyard manure (NPK + FYM) and unfertilized (control) treatments were used to calculate carbon sequestration potential (CSP) i.e.. capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) by increasing SOC stock, under different nutrient management scenarios. In most of the LTEs wheat equivalent yields were higher in the NPK + FYM treatment than the NPK treatment. However, partial factor productivity (PFP) was more with the NPK treatment. Average SOC concentration of the control treatment was 0.54%, which increased to 0.65% in the NPK treatment and 0.82% in the NPK + FYM treatment. Compared to the control treatment the NPK + FYM treatment sequestered 0.33 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) whereas the NPK treatment sequestered 0.16 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The CSP in different nutrient management scenarios ranged from 2.1 to 4.8 Mg C ha(-1) during the study period (average 16.9 yr) of the LTEs. In 17 out of 26 LTEs, the NPK + FYM treatment had higher SOC and also higher net return than that of the NPK treatment. In the remaining 9 LTEs SOC sequestration in the NPK + FYM treatment was accomplished with decreased net return suggesting that these are economically not attractive and farmers have to incur into additional cost to achieve C sequestration. The feasibility of SOC sequestration in terms of availability of FYM and other organic sources has been discussed in the paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"The west coast of subtropical South America is characterized by a semi-arid climate and very persistent southerly winds that often exhibit a low-level jet structure. The nearly alongshore flow forces coastal and offshore upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich waters, thus supporting one of the Most productive marine ecosystems in the world and a wealth of fishery resources. Therefore, the evaluation of the changes in the coastal winds in future climate is a key step to predict the regional environmental impacts of global climate change linked to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) increases. In this work we document the wind changes between present-day conditions and those projected for the end of the 21st century under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (A2 and B2). We first estimate and interpret the changes of the wind field over the southeast Pacific from 15 coupled atmosphere-ocean Global Circulation Models (GCMs). Very consistent among the GCMs is the strengthening of the southerlies along the Subtropical coast as a result of a marked increase in Surface pressure farther south. We then examine the coastal wind changes in more detail using the Providing REgional Climate for Impact Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model (RCM) with 25 kin horizontal resolution nested in the Hadley Centre Atmospheric global Model (HadAM3). PRECIS results indicate that the largest southerly wind increase occurs between 37-41 degrees S during spring and summer, expanding the upwelling-favourable regime in that region, at the same time that coastal jets at subtropical latitudes will become more frequent and last longer than current events. During fall and winter, the strengthening of the southerlies occurs at subtropical latitudes maintaining a mean jet year-round. Finally, we discuss the possibility that strengthening of the coastal southerlies might actually lead to a relative regional cooling even as the world as a whole continues to warm up.

"The Mediterranean basin is a region characterized by its vulnerability to changes in the water cycle. Hence, the impact of global warming on the water resources in the Mediterranean zone is one of the major concerns for the scientific community. The future climate projections used to elaborate the IPCC report of 2007 show great alterations in the evaporation and precipitation over the Mediterranean Sea at the end of 21st century. In this work we investigate the changes in the Mediterranean Sea water budget by using SRES-A1B scenario experiments performed with high resolution (25 km) regional climate models (RCMs). The RCMs provide good estimates of the water budget components, in particular with a significant improvement of the runoff and Black Sea discharge terms compared to the coarser resolution general circulation models (GCMs) used in the last Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) report. As for the case of GCMs, the RCMs show that the Mediterranean water budget is likely to be significantly altered at the end of 21st century. The response of the hydrological variables to global warming starts to be statistically significant from 2050, though some alterations are already observed before 2050. The RCMs predict an increase of evaporation, and a decrease of precipitation, and river and Black Sea discharge, yielding to a large increase of the Mediterranean fresh water deficit. The freshwater deficit for the period 2070-2099 related to 1950-1999 presents a mean increase of +40% for both RCMs and GCMs. Citation: Sanchez-Gomez, E., S. Somot, and A.

"The poplar bioenergy system has been analysed applying life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare its environmental performance to: Ethiopian mustard bioenergy system and natural gas. The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) shows that the use of fertilizers is the highest impact in four of the 10 environmental categories, representing between 39% and 67% of the impact in them. The diesel used in transport vehicles and agricultural tractors also has a significant impact in another five of the 10 analysed categories 40-85%. The poplar bioenergy system contributes to global warming with 1-90-98 gCO(2)eq MJ(-1) biomass produced. The production and transport as far as the thermoelectric plant of the poplar biomass consumes 0.02 MJ of primary energy per 1 MJ of biomass stored. In comparison with Ethiopian mustard and natural gas, it reduces primary energy consumption by 83% and 89% and the greenhouse gas emission by 84% and 89%, respectively. The results of the analysis support that the poplar bioenergy system is viable from an energy balance and environmental perspective for producing energy in southern Europe, as long as it is cultivated in areas where water is available. This latter point and the better environmental performance of both crops in comparison to natural gas allows us to affirm that the combination of several crops adapted to the local agro-climatic conditions of the territory will be the most suitable strategy in Mediterranean areas that wish to reach the global energy production targets in terms of biomass established by the European Union (EU).

"Use of biomass fuel in traditional cooking stoves (TCS) is a long-established practice that has incomplete combustion and generates substances with global warming potential (GWP). Improved cooking stoves (ICS) have been developed worldwide as an alternative household fuel burning device, as well as a climate change mitigation. A study was conducted among female Forest User Groups (FUGs) of Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh, to assess the status of ICS disseminated by the Forest Department (FD) under the Nishorgo (2009) Support Project, along with the community's biomass fuel consumption pattern. Wood consumption was highest (345kg month-1 household-1) followed by agricultural residues (60kg month-1 household-1), tree leaves (51kg month-1 household-1) and cow dung (25kg month-1 household-1). Neighbouring forests of the sanctuary was the core source for wood fuel, with little or no reduction in the extraction even after joining the FUG. Twenty-two species, both indigenous and introduced, were preferred as wood fuel. None of the respondents were found willing to use ICS although 43% owned one; either as a status symbol or to meet the conditions of the FD for membership in FUG. Seven negative features of the disseminated ICS were identified by households, which made them unwilling to use them further. Manufacturing faults may be responsible for some ICS demerits, while the FD failed to convince the community of the benefits. A proper examination of the disseminated ICS efficacy is crucial, with active involvement of community members. The Sustainable Energy Triangle Strategy (SETS) could be implemented for this purpose.

Models used to test whether an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) can be used to describe the relationship between GDP and energy use and/or carbon emissions may be biased by the omission of energy prices. Here we include real energy prices and fuel shares in models that describe energy use and carbon emissions. We test if these models show a turning point in OECD countries. Results indicate that including energy prices eliminates statistical support for a turning point and suggest that the relationship between income and both energy use and carbon emissions is represented most accurately by diminishing returns. These results imply that economic growth per se will not reduce energy use or emissions that cause global climate change.,1
"Biofuels are important because they span three of the greatest issues of our time-world industrial development; energy security and the transition to a bioeconomy; and global warming. Biofuels have something important to contribute as a solution in each of these three areas-without being a 'magic bullet' or the whole of the solution in any of them. Indeed, biofuels may be a transitory solution that will phase out after two or three decades as new electric-powered transport systems take over. But in the meantime, biofuels have the potential to bring together North and South in a new Biopact of transcendent significance, promising to allow countries of the South to lift themselves out of poverty through biofuel cultivation, processing and export; and countries of the North to solve their transport and global warming problems by opening up to biofuels produced sustainably and responsibly from the tropical South. A goal of 2000 biorefineries over the course of the next decade is entirely realistic: their output would be of the order of 400 billion liters of ethanol and/or biodiesel, or about one fifth of OECD countries' current transport fuel requirements. The investment required would be of the order of US$240 billion over a decade compared with the more than $470 billion expected by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to be invested in the oil and gas industry in a single year by 2010. In this light, the investment required is modest. Such an investment can only be undertaken if markets in the North are guaranteed. The best means of achieving such an investment-grade guarantee is through a comprehensive global trade agreement. But the prospects for such an agreement are vitiated by the cacophony of opposition to biofuels raised in the North, by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and vested interests, who are raising hysterical concerns over the transition from fossil fuels to biofuels, and stand accused of seeking industrial protection under the guise of environmental concerns.

"The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the environmental load of two different concentrate feed supply systems to the Japanese domestic livestock industry using the Life-cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The current system was defined as that requiring 1469 million tons of corn imported from the US by sea transport and supplied as concentrate feed to the Japanese domestic livestock industry The new system proposed by Kaku et al. in 2004 was defined as where 802,830 tons of US imported corn would not be planted in US and would be replaced by barley planted in 278 thousand ha of Japanese domestic land left fallow for the past year. In this case, 909,000 tons of domestic harvest barley would have been supplied as concentrate feed to the Japanese domestic livestock industry in 2000. The activities taken into account within the two system boundaries were three stages: concentrate feed production, feed transportation and gas emission from the soil by chemical fertilizer. Finished compost was regarded as organic fertilizer and was put instead of chemical fertilizers within the system boundary Adoption of this new concentrate feed supply system by the Japanese domestic livestock industry could reduce 78,462 tons CO2-equivalents of global warming potential, 347 tons SO2-equivalents of acidification potential, 54 tons PO4-equivalents of eutrophication potential and 0.842 million GJ as energy consumption below 2,000 levels. This LCA study comparing two Japanese domestic livestock concentrate feed supply systems showed that the stage of feed transport contributed most to global warming and the stage of emission from the soil contributed most to acidification and eutrophication. The Japanese domestic livestock industry could participate in emissions trading with CO2-equivalents reduced by shifting from some imported US corn as a concentrate feed to domestic barley planted in land left fallow. In that case the Japanese government could launch emissions trading in accordance with Kyoto Protocol in the future.",1
"The impacts of air conditioning and refrigeration systems on stratospheric ozone are primarily linked to release of ozone-depleting refrigerants. Their contributions to global warming stem both from release of refrigerants and from emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) for associated energy use. Because the energy-related component has a significantly higher warming impact, phaseout of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants with less efficient options will increase net GHG emissions. The same conclusion applies for perfluorocarbon (PFCs), though they are less commonly used as refrigerants. Integrated assessment of ozone depletion, global warming, and atmospheric lifetime provides essential indications in the absence of ideal refrigerants, namely those free of these problems as well as safety, stability, compatibility, cost, and similar burdens. This study examines the trend in refrigerant losses from chiller use. It documents both substantial progress in release reductions and the technical innovations to achieve them. It contrasts the impacts of current refrigerants with alternatives and with the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) they replaced. The study examines the sensitivity of efficiency to charge loss. It also summarizes thermodynamic and environmental comparisons of options to show that phaseout decisions based on chemical composition alone, without regard to attributes of individual substances, can result in greater environmental harm than benefit.

"Carbon cycle is connected with the most important environmental issue of Global Change. As one of the major carbon reservoirs, oceans play an important part in the carbon cycle. In recent years, iron seems to give us a good news that oceanic iron fertilization could stimulate biological productivity as CO2 sink of human-produced CO2. Oceanic iron fertilization experiments have verified that adding iron into high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) seawaters can increase phytoplankton production and export organic carbon, and hence increase carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2, to reduce global warming. In sixty days, the export organic carbon could reach 10 000 times for adding iron by model prediction and in situ experiment, i.e. the atmospheric CO2 uptake and inorganic carbon drawdown in upper seawaters also have the same magnitude. Therefore, oceanic iron fertilization is one of the strategies for increasing carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2. The paper is focused on the iron fertilization, especially in situ ocean iron experiments in order that the future research is more efficient.",1
"The predicted global warming may affect freshwater systems at several organizational levels, from organism to ecosystem. Specifically, in temperate regions, the projected increase of winter temperatures may have important effects on the over-winter biology of a range of organisms and especially for fish and other ectothermic animals. However, temperature effects on organisms may be directed strongly by resource availability. Here, we investigated whether over-winter loss of biomass and lipid content of juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) was affected by the physiologically relatively small (2-5 degrees C) changes of winter temperatures predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under both natural and experimental conditions. This was investigated in combination with the effects of food availability. Finally, we explored the potential for a correlation between lake temperature and resource levels for planktivorous fish, i.e., zooplankton biomass, during five consecutive winters in a south Swedish lake. We show that small increases in temperature (+2 degrees C) affected fish biomass loss in both presence and absence of food, but negatively and positively respectively. Temperature alone explained only a minor part of the variation when food availability was not taken into account. In contrast to other studies, lipid analyses of experimental fish suggest that critical somatic condition rather than critical lipid content determined starvation induced mortality. Our results illustrate the importance of considering not only changes in temperature when predicting organism response to climate change but also food-web interactions, such as resource availability and predation. However, as exemplified by our finding that zooplankton over-winter biomass in the lake was not related to over-winter temperature, this may not be a straightforward task.",1
The Kyoto Protocol on global warming has provoked great controversy in part because it calls for heavier burdens on wealthy countries than on developing countries in the effort to control climate change. The U.S. Senate voted unanimously to oppose any agreement that does not require emissions reductions in low-income countries. The ethics of this position are examined in this paper which shows that there are good moral reasons for supporting the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol. Such a conclusion follows easily from considerations of distributive justice but can also be supported by more narrowly self-interested arguments.,1
"Hydrological processes are an integral component of both global climate change arising from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and the assessment of subsequent terrestrial impacts. This article examines the potential sensivity of water resources in the UK to climatic change as exemplified by the 1988-92 drought. The representation of hydrological processes at three distinct model scales is then discussed with reference to global hydrology, regional downscaling and catchment-scale responses. A final section speculates on future directions of research for an emerging greenhouse hydrology.",1
"Undergraduate engineering students have an important role to play in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. This paper tackles the societal concern of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by introducing a simple junior or senior-level experiment that illustrates the phenomenon of gas adsorption as a tool for carbon dioxide separation from a gas stream that simulates power plant flue gas emissions. The experiment familiarizes chemical and environmental engineering students with the characteristics of gas separation by adsorption with activated alumina, zeolite 13 X, and soda lime, while highlighting its potential)for carbon dioxide, reduction at ambient conditions and at a relevant concentration (partial pressure) of carbon dioxide. This should be of interest to faculty who teach unit operations-type laboratory courses; they will find it an excellent 'sustainable engineering' hands-on addendum to traditional curricula.",1
"The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at c. 55.8 Ma marks a transient (c. 100 ka duration) interval of rapid greenhouse warming that had profound effects on marine and terrestrial biota. Plant communities responded rapidly with major compositional turnover. The long-term effects on tropical vegetation communities that stein from the brief period of global warming are unclear. We present pollen data from the paratropical US Gulf Coast (eastern Mississippi, western Alabama and Georgia), which had background Palacogene mean annual temperatures of 26-27 degrees C. Sporomorph data (pollen and spores) demonstrate that taxonomic diversity increases over c. 1 Ma in the Late Palaeocene but this trend is replaced, with the first occurrences of taxa that mark the Early Eocene, by a pronounced extinction into the Early Eocene (c. 20% of the palynoflora). Taxonomic diversity also decreases by up to 38% in the Early Eocene. The timing of the extinction is not clearly resolved but may be restricted to the earliest part of the Early Eocene. Two richness estimators (Chao 2 and Jackknife 2) both demonstrate that Late Palaeocene samples contain significantly more taxa than those in the Early Eocene. Extinction on the US Gulf Coast proves that ancient tropical ecosystems were highly susceptible to changes in diversity mediated directly or indirectly by environmental change even during equable greenhouse climates in the early Palaeogene.",1
"Environmentally benign etching process of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and tungsten (W) by using a plasma process with an evaporation of solid materials system has been developed for replacing a conventional plasma process using green house gases, such as SF6 gas and perfluorocompound gases causing global warming. The evaporation system was designed to generate fluorocarbon species from solid materials by a CO, laser irradiation. An electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma using O-2 accompanied with injection of species evaporated from solid materials has been applied to a-Si and W etching for cleaning process in chemical vapor deposition chamber. Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are selected as the solid material and the etching characteristics between FEP and PTFE have been compared. Furthermore, the etching of a-Si and W films has been performed in the divergent magnetic field ECR downstream plasma [electron density (n(e)); similar to 10(10) cm(-3), electron temperature (T-e); 5-2.8 eV] and a planar ECR plasma [n(e); similar to10(10) cm(-3), T-e; 3.4-4.4 eV] using O-2 gas with FEP evaporation. As a result, high etching rates of a-Si and W films of above 100 nm/min were successfully obtained at a substrate temperature of 400 degreesC in the planar ECR plasma of higher electron temperature. CFx (x = 1-3) radical densities and F atom density in plasmas were measured by an infrared diode laser absorption spectroscopy and an actinometric optical emission spectroscopy. respectively. On the basis of these measurements of species. the etching mechanisms of a-Si and W films are discussed. (C) 2003 American Vacuum Society.",1
"The clearing of forest during the last two centuries has contributed to the growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the prospect of global warming. The OECD, under the auspices of the IPCC, has developed a set of standard procedures for estimating greenhouse gas exchanges, including carbon dioxide exchange from forest clearing and regrowth. We present an alternative algorithm for estimating carbon dioxide exchange from forest clearing and regrowth based on a simple plant/soil model (DCDT) and compare it with the IPCC/OECD algorithm using two worked examples: constant clearing and constant regrowth of a semi-arid mallee forest in Australia. In these examples, the initial and final (equilibrium) carbon in the plant and soil are the same in both algorithms. The algorithms differ in their time scales of response. The IPCC/OECD algorithm, when compared with the DCDT algorithm, overestimates the carbon dioxide emissions from converting mallee forest to wheat cropping by up to 33%, averaged over a decade. The IPCC/OECD algorithm, when compared with the DCDT algorithm, underestimates the emission from regenerating the cleared land by as much as 100% over a decade. These differences arise when the rates of land clearing and regeneration vary on a time scale shorter than that for the biosphere to equilibrate after a land use change or disturbance. This study shows that the improved quantification of the processes of carbon dynamics in the plant/litter/soil system may be as important as improving the mapping of areas cleared and current carbon pools in reducing the uncertainties associated with CO2 emissions from forest clearing.

"A method is presented that allows for a life cycle assessment (LCA) to provide environmental information on an energy infrastructure system while it evolves. Energy conversion facilities are represented in an agent-based model (ABM) as distinct instances of technologies with owners capable of making decisions based on economic and environmental information. This simulation setup allows us to explore the dynamics of assembly, disassembly, and use of these systems, which typically span decades, and to analyze the effect of using LCA information in decision making. We were able to integrate a simplified LCA into an ABM by aligning and connecting the data structures that represent the energy infrastructure and the supply chains from source to sink. By using an appropriate database containing life cycle inventory (LCI) information and by solving the scaling factors for the technology matrix, we computed the contribution to global warming in terms of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) equivalents in the form of a single impact indicator for each instance of technology at each discrete simulation step. These LCAs may then serve to show each agent the impact of its activities at a global level, as indicated by its contribution to climate change. Similar to economic indicators, the LCA indicators may be fed back to the simulated decision making in the ABM to emulate the use of environmental information while the system evolves. A proof of concept was developed that is illustrated for a simplified LCA and ABM used to generate and simulate the evolution of a bioelectricity infrastructure system.",1
"This paper applies the newest emission scenarios of the sulfur and greenhouse gases, namely IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios, to investigate the change of the North China climate with an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model. In the last three decades of the 21st century, the global warming enlarges the land-sea thermal contrast, and hence, causes the East Asian summer (winter) monsoon circulation to be strengthened (weakened). The rainfall seasonality strengthens and the summer precipitation increases significantly in North China. It is suggested that the East Asian rainy area would expand northward to North China in the last three decades of the 21st century. In addition, the North China precipitation would increase significantly in September. In July, August, and September, the interannual variability of the precipitation enlarges evidently over North China, implying a risk of flooding in the future.",1
"It is now widely recognised that the most significant impacts of global warming are likely to be experienced through changes in the frequency of extreme events, including flooding. This paper reviews physical and empirical arguments which suggest that global warming may result in a more intense hydrological cycle, with an associated increase in the frequency and/or magnitude of heavy precipitation. Results derived from enhanced-greenhouse experiments using global climate models (GCMs) are shown to be consistent with these physical and empirical arguments. Detailed analysis of output from three GCMs indicates the possibility of substantial increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme daily precipitation, with amplification of the effect as the return period increases. Moreover, return period analyses for locations in Australia, Europe, India, China and the USA indicate that the results are global in scope. Subsequent discussion of the limitations of GCMs for this sort of analysis highlights the need for caution when interpreting the precipitation results presented here. However, the consistency between physically-based expectations, empirical observations, and GCM results is considered sufficient for the GCM results to be taken seriously, at least in a qualitative sense, especially considering that the alternative seems to be reliance by planners on the fundamentally flawed concept of a stationary climate.",1
"The world's soils contain about 1500 Gt of organic carbon to a depth of 1m and a further 900 Gt from 1-2m. A change of total soil organic carbon by just 10% would thus be equivalent to all the anthropogenic CO2 emitted over 30 years. Warming is likely to increase both the rate of decomposition and net primary production (NPP), with a fraction of NPP forming new organic carbon. Evidence from various sources can be used to assess whether NPP or the rate of decomposition has the greater temperature sensitivity, and, hence, whether warming is likely to lead to an increase or decrease in soil organic carbon. Evidence is reviewed from laboratory-based incubations, field measurements of organic carbon storage, carbon isotope ratios and soil respiration with either naturally varying temperatures or after experimentally increasing soil temperatures. Estimates of terrestrial carbon stored at the Last Glacial Maximum are also reviewed. The review concludes that the temperature dependence of organic matter decomposition can be best described as: d(T) = exp[3.36 (T - 40)/(T + 379)] where d(T) is the normalised decomposition rate at temperature T (in degrees C). In this equation, decomposition rate is normalised to '1' at 40 degrees C. The review concludes by simulating the likely changes in soil organic carbon with warming. In summary, it appears likely that warming will have the effect of reducing soil organic carbon by stimulating decomposition rates more than NPP. However, increasing CO2 is likely to simultaneously have the effect of increasing soil organic carbon through increases in NPP. Any changes are also likely to be very slow. The net effect of changes in soil organic carbon on atmospheric CO2 loading over the next decades to centuries is, therefore, likely to be small.",1
"Soil carbon changes upon secondary succession in Imperata grasslands are important both for their effect on potential production and for possible implications of forest degradation and regeneration on global climate change. We studied the effect of forest regeneration after fire in Imperata (speargrass) grasslands of East Kalimantan on soil properties, using 47 plots that last burned in 2004. 94 plots that last burned in 2003,126 plots last burned before 2003, 43 plots of secondary forest, and 28 plots of primary forest. Although soil carbon stocks increase upon natural regeneration from grassland to secondary forest, highest carbon stocks are found in the later regeneration phases and lowest under primary forest. This is contrary to the situation in other forest systems. Low C stocks under primary forests may be due to extremely low fertility, combined with shallow soils and low root mass in the topsoil. Root density-as observed in the field-is much higher under the grass vegetation. The effects of regeneration on soil are strongest in the A-horizon, where soil carbon content increases with 14%, from 14.5 g kg(-1) in Imperata grassland to 16.5 g kg(-1) in secondary forest, while carbon stocks in the A-horizon increase from 16.51 ton C ha(-1) to 18.70 ton C ha(-1). This is accompanied by a decrease in pH and an increase in bulk density. The total soil carbon stocks in Kalimantan (fixed mass, approximate depth section 40 cm) are 36.19 ton ha(-1) in Imperata grassland, 38.98 ton ha(-1) in secondary forest and 33.19 ton ha(-1) in primary forest, which is considerably lower than in Sumatra. Above-ground C/below-ground C ratios are higher in Kalimantan primary forest but lower in Kalimantan secondary forest than in Sumatra. Soil carbon stocks in Imperata grassland could be lower than previously thought. This has important consequences for carbon sequestration projects in East Kalimantan, because carbon storage potentials could be higher. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"The consistency between rainfall projections obtained from direct climate model output and statistical downscaling is evaluated. Results are averaged across an area large enough to overcome the difference in spatial scale between these two types of projections and thus make the comparison meaningful. Undertaking the comparison using a suite of state-of-the-art coupled climate models for two forcing scenarios presents a unique opportunity to test whether statistical linkages established between large-scale predictors and local rainfall under current climate remain valid in future climatic conditions. The study focuses on the southwest corner of Western Australia, a region that has experienced recent winter rainfall declines and for which climate models project, with great consistency, further winter rainfall reductions due to global warming. Results show that as a first approximation the magnitude of the modeled rainfall decline in this region is linearly related to the model global warming ( a reduction of about 9% per degree), thus linking future rainfall declines to future emission paths. Two statistical downscaling techniques are used to investigate the influence of the choice of technique on projection consistency. In addition, one of the techniques was assessed using different large-scale forcings, to investigate the impact of large-scale predictor selection. Downscaled and direct model projections are consistent across the large number of models and two scenarios considered; that is, there is no tendency for either to be biased; and only a small hint that large rainfall declines are reduced in downscaled projections. Among the two techniques, a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model provides greater consistency with climate models than an analog approach. Differences were due to the choice of the optimal combination of predictors. Thus statistically downscaled projections require careful choice of large-scale predictors in order to be consistent with physically based rainfall projections. In particular it was noted that a relative humidity moisture predictor, rather than specific humidity, was needed for downscaled projections to be consistent with direct model output projections.",1
"HCF-134a (CF3CH2F) is the most rapidly growing hydrofluorocarbon in terms of atmospheric abundance. It is currently used in a large number of household refrigerators and air-conditioning systems and its concentration in the atmosphere is forecast to increase substantially over the next 50-100 years. Previous estimates of its radiative forcing per unit concentration have differed significantly similar to25%. This paper uses a two-step approach to resolve this discrepancy. In the first step six independent absorption cross section datasets are analysed. We find that, for the integrated cross section in the spectral bands that contribute most to the radiative forcing, the differences between the various datasets are typically smaller than 5% and that the dependence on pressure and temperature is not significant. A ""recommended"" HFC-134a infrared absorption spectrum was obtained based on the average band intensities of the strongest bands. In the second step, the ""recommended"" HFC-134a spectrum was used in six different radiative transfer models to calculate the HFC-134a radiative forcing efficiency. The clear-sky instantaneous radiative forcing, using a single global and annual mean profile, differed by 8%, between the 6 models, and the latitudinally-resolved adjusted cloudy sky radiative forcing estimates differed by a similar amount. We calculate that the radiative forcing efficiency of HFC-134a is 0.16 +/- 0.02 Wm(-2)ppbv(-1). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Emissions from land transport, and from road transport in particular, have significant impacts on the atmosphere and on climate change. This assessment gives an overview of past, present and future emissions from land transport, of their impacts on the atmospheric composition and air quality, on human health and climate change and on options for mitigation. In the past vehicle exhaust emission control has successfully reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. This contributed to improved air quality and reduced health impacts in industrialised countries. In developing countries however, pollutant emissions have been growing strongly, adversely affecting many populations. In addition, ozone and particulate matter change the radiative balance and hence contribute to global warming on shorter time scales. Latest knowledge on the magnitude of land transport's impact on global warming is reviewed here. In the future, road transport's emissions of these pollutants are expected to stagnate and then decrease globally. This will then help to improve the air quality notably in developing countries. On the contrary, emissions of carbon dioxide and of halocarbons from mobile air conditioners have been globally increasing and are further expected to grow. Consequently, road transport's impact on climate is gaining in importance. The expected efficiency improvements of vehicles and the introduction of biofuels will not be sufficient to offset the expected strong growth in both, passenger and freight transportation. Technical measures could offer a significant reduction potential, but strong interventions would be needed as markets do not initiate the necessary changes. Further reductions would need a resolute expansion of low-carbon fuels, a tripling of vehicle fuel efficiency and a stagnation in absolute transport volumes. Land transport will remain a key sector in climate change mitigation during the next decades. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"I investigate the response of the present-day thermohaline circulation to a greenhouse gas induced global warming under different surface thermohaline conditions in a global Bryan/Cox [Bryan, 1969; Cox, 1989] ocean general circulation model with realistic bathymetry and geometry. Initially the model is spun up With surface temperature and salinity relaxed to Levitus [1982] climatologies. The forcing condition for salinity is then switched to a diagnosed flux, while that for temperature is provided by a restoration with a timescale of either 30 days (strong relaxation) or 300 days (weak relaxation). The present-day ocean climate is obtained under these two sets of thermohaline conditions. Under the strong restoration the modeled North Atlantic Deep Water Formation (NADWF) settles to an intensified state. Under the weak relaxation the model solution hardly differs from that of the spin-up. The ocean states are then subject to a global warming at a rate similar to that of the double CO2 experiment in a fully coupled model described by Manabe and Stouffer [1993, 1994]. The global thermohaline circulations under the weak relaxation show an initial weakening and shallowing, continued weakening upon the cessation of the atmospheric warming, and eventual reestablishment of their strengths. These behavior patterns are not unlike those found in the fully coupled model but are in sharp contrast to those in the case under the strong restoration, where NADWF eventually collapses. The processes responsible for these differences are discussed.",1
"This work aims at understanding future spatial and temporal distributions of tree species in the Mediterranean region of France under various climates. We focused on two different species (Pinus Halepensis and Quercus Ilex) and compared their growth under the IPCC-B2 climate scenario in order to quantify significant changes between present and future. The influence of environmental factors such as atmospheric CO2 increase and topography on the tree growth has also been quantified. We modeled species growth with the help of a process-based model (MAIDEN), previously calibrated over measured ecophysiological and dendrochronological series with a Bayesian scheme. The model was fed with the ARPEGE - MeteoFrance climate model, combined with an explicit increase in CO2 atmospheric concentration. The main output of the model gives the carbon allocation in boles and thus tree production. Our results show that the MAIDEN model is correctly able to simulate pine and oak production in space and time, after detailed calibration and validation stages. Yet, these simulations, mainly based on climate, are indicative and not predictive. The comparison of simulated growth at end of 20th and 21st centuries, show a shift of the pine production optimum from about 650 to 950m due to 2.5K temperature increase, while no optimum has been found for oak. With the direct effect of CO2 increase taken into account, both species show a significant increase in productivity (+ 26 and + 43% for pine and oak respectively) at the end of the 21st century. While both species have different growth mechanisms, they have a good chance to extend their spatial distribution and their elevation in the Alps during the 21st century under the IPCC-B2 climate scenario. This extension is mainly due to the CO2 fertilization effect.",1
"Paleoecological studies enhance our understanding of biotic response to climate change because they consider timescales not accessible through laboratory or ecological studies. From 60 to 51 million years ago (Ma), global temperatures gradually warmed to the greatest sustained highs of the last 65 million years. Superimposed on this gradual warming is a transient spike of high temperature and pCO(2) (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 55.8 Ma) and a subsequent short-term cooling event (similar to 54 Ma). The highly resolved continental fossil record of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, spans this interval and is therefore uniquely suited to examine the long-term effects of temperature change on the two dominant groups in terrestrial ecosystems, plants and insect herbivores. We sampled insect damage on fossil angiosperm leaves at nine well-dated localities that range in age from 52.7 to 59 Ma. A total of 9071 leaves belonging to 107 species were examined for the presence or absence of 71 insect-feeding damage types. Damage richness, frequency, and composition were analyzed on the bulk floras and individual host species. Overall, there was a strong positive correlation between changes in damage richness and changes in estimated temperature, a weak positive relationship for damage frequency and temperature, and no significant correlation for floral diversity. Thus, insect damage richness appears to be more sensitive to past climate change than to plant diversity, although plant diversity in our samples only ranges from 6 to 25 dicot species. The close tracking of the richness of herbivore damage, a presumed proxy for actual insect herbivore richness, to both warming and cooling over a finely divided, extended time interval has profound importance for interpreting the evolution of insects and plant-insect associations in the context of deep time. Our results also indicate that increased insect herbivory is likely to be a net long-term effect of anthropogenic warming.",1
"At the boundary between the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs, about 55 million years ago, the Earth experienced a strong global warming event, the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum(1-4). The leading hypothesis to explain the extreme greenhouse conditions prevalent during this period is the dissociation of 1,400 to 2,800 gigatonnes of methane from ocean clathrates(5,6), resulting in a large negative carbon isotope excursion and severe carbonate dissolution in marine sediments. Possible triggering mechanisms for this event include crossing a threshold temperature as the Earth warmed gradually(7), comet impact(8), explosive volcanism(9,10) or ocean current reorganization and erosion at continental slopes(11), whereas orbital forcing has been excluded(12). Here we report a distinct carbonate-poor red clay layer in deep-sea cores from Walvis ridge(13), which we term the Elmo horizon. Using orbital tuning, we estimate deposition of the Elmo horizon at about 2 million years after the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum. The Elmo horizon has similar geochemical and biotic characteristics as the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum, but of smaller magnitude. It is coincident with carbon isotope depletion events in other ocean basins, suggesting that it represents a second global thermal maximum. We show that both events correspond to maxima in the similar to 405-kyr and similar to 100-kyr eccentricity cycles that post-date prolonged minima in the 2.25-Myr eccentricity cycle, implying that they are indeed astronomically paced.",1
"A very serious effort to modernize irrigation systems is being made in Spain, to reduce water and energy losses in an environmentally sustainable way. This is expensive and it is important that the new irrigation systems work properly over a long period. The systems have been designed taking into account historical evapotranspiration (ET) averages during the months of maximum demand, as well as the crop-specific ET values (Kc coefficients) of typical crops. However, the increase in ET rates due to global warming could mean that the capacity of these new and expensive irrigation systems to fulfil the crop water requirements may be exceeded in the near future. However, the expected increase in CO, concentration could diminish crop transpiration rates for similar water demands from the atmosphere, thereby reducing irrigation requirements. A methodology was developed in order to estimate crop water requirements under climate change conditions. The reliability of a new irrigation system designed in Valladolid, Northern Spain was tested. The regionalized climate change scenarios for Valladolid, provided by the National Institute of Meteorology, were used for the periods 2011-40, 2041-70 and 2071-2100 and the A2 and B2 emission scenarios were considered using the ECHAM and coupled general circulation model (CGCM) global circulation models. A historical series of daily meteorological data for Valladolid was used to generate statistical ET distributions through the LARS-WG generator. Simulations considered each of the above periods, global circulation models (GCM) and emission scenarios. Furthermore, the Kc of the typical irrigated crops of the zone (maize, potato and sugar beet) were reduced for each period, GCM and emission scenario according to the relationships between CO(2) concentrations and transpiration obtained by Kruijt et al. (2008). The results indicated that, on average, historical ET rates provide a sufficiently robust indicator to enable estimations of the crop ET in the future, particularly considering the CO(2) effect in reducing crop transpiration. However, ET variability is significantly increased after 2040, especially for the A2 emission scenario. The results show that ET variability rather than global increase is the most serious risk that current irrigation systems must face in the near future in Northern Spain, as consequence of climate change. Such variability should be included in irrigation designs.",1
"Afforestation is one of the most promising measures to mitigate global climate change because the expected carbon stock is estimated at as much as tens of tons per hectare or more. However, possible large-scale afforestation areas are limited to unused or ineffectively-used and type lands. In the present study, a hardpan layer in Western Australia in an and zone with no remarkable vegetation, a land type which is often found in the and zones of the world, was blasted to produce holes and cracks for water penetration and root development. This study shows that hardpan blasting drastically accelerated root development and tree growth one or two years after planting. The blasting was done with additional CO2 emission of only one fortieth of the CO2 expected to be absorbed by trees after maturity.",1
"Oxidation by hydroxyl radicals is the main removal process for organic compounds in the troposphere. This oxidation acts as a source of ozone and as a removal process for hydroxyl and peroxy radicals, thereby reducing the efficiency of methane oxidation and promoting the build-up of methane. Emissions of organic compounds may therefore lead to the build-up of two important radiatively-active trace gases: methane and ozone. Emission pulses of 10 organic compounds were followed in a global 3-D Lagrangian chemistry-transport model to quantify their indirect greenhouse gas impacts through changes induced in the tropospheric distributions of methane and ozone. The main factors influencing the global warming potentials of the 10 organic compounds were found to be their spatial emission patterns, chemical reactivity and transport, molecular complexity and oxidation products formed. The indirect radiative forcing impacts of organic compounds may be large enough that ozone precursors should be considered in the basket of trace gases through which policy-makers aim to combat global climate change.",1
"The relationships between the natural variability and CO2-induced response over the Pacific region are investigated in terms of the spatial anomaly pattern of SST, sea level pressure and precipitation by a multi-model intercomparison analysis, based on the 18-model results contributing to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. The analysis indicates that the CO2-induced response pattern is related with the model natural variability modes, ENSO and AO. In the tropical Pacific, an ENSO-like global warming pattern is simulated by the majority of the models, with mostly El Ni (n) over tildeo-like change. In the Arctic region, an AO-like global warming pattern is simulated by many models, with the positive definite AO-phase change, if AO-like. It is suggested that the increase in meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere, and the lower stratosphere, provides a preferable condition for the positive AO-like change in the high latitudes by intensifying the subtropical jet, while the increase in the static stability provides a preferable condition for the El Ni (n) over tildeo-like change in the low latitudes, by reducing the large-scale ambient circulations. However, the sign of the mass (SLP) anomaly is incompatible over the North Pacific, between the positive AO-like change and the El Ni (n) over tildeo-like change. As a result, the present models cannot fully determine the relative importance between the mechanisms inducing the positive AO-like change and inducing the ENSO-like change, leading to scattering in global warming patterns in regional scales over the North Pacific.",1
"This study presents the results of a life cycle analysis (LCA) of greenhouse gas emissions from power generation systems in order to understand the characteristics of these systems from the perspective of global warming. Nine different types of power generation systems were examined: coal-fired, oil-fired, LNG-fired, LNG-combined cycle, nuclear, hydropower, geothermal, wind power and solar-photovoltaic (PV). Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission per kW h of electricity generated was estimated for the systems using a combined method of process analysis and input-output analysis. First, average power generation systems reflecting the current status in Japan were examined as base cases. Second, the impacts of emerging and future nuclear, wind power and PV technologies were analyzed. Finally, uncertainties associated with some assumptions were examined to help clarify interpretation of the results. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",1
"The financial institutions have in recent years been progressively awakening to a severe threat inherent in human-enhancement of the greenhouse effect. Insurance companies, and increasingly banks and pension funds, have come to fear that a warming world holds the danger of unmanageable property-catastrophe losses triggered by an increase in extreme climate-related events, plus a spectrum of major knock-on problems for debt and equity investments. This emerging greenhouse market-driver now has major implications for corporate strategy in both the financial and energy sectors.",1
"There has been much debate over the possibility that radiative cooling due to anthropogenic aerosols may substantially offset global warming from the enhanced greenhouse effect of raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. It is accepted that regional climates may alter if the net local forcing is non-zero. However, recent studies have alluded to the possibility of climate change even when the net radiative forcing from aerosols and carbon dioxide is very small. We present calculations demonstrating that even when the net radiative forcing of climate from simultaneous aerosol and CO2 perturbations at all locations is zero, heating rates within the atmosphere and surface radiation characteristics may still be substantially altered. Given the effect of radiative heating on atmospheric motions, and the dependence of biological systems on insolation, we conclude that the effects of possible climate change even when the mean radiative forcing at all locations is unchanged need to be quantified. Although an important quantity, the radiative forcing of climate should not be used as the sole indicator of possible climate change.",1
"The accelerated rate of increase in atmospheric CO(2) concentration in recent years has revived the idea of stabilizing the global climate through geoengineering schemes. Majority of the proposed geoengineering schemes will attempt to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by our planet. Climate modelling studies of these so called 'sunshade geoengineering schemes' show that global warming from increasing concentrations of CO(2) can be mitigated by intentionally manipulating the amount of sunlight absorbed by the climate system. These studies also suggest that the residual changes could be large on regional scales, so that climate change may not be mitigated on a local basis. More recent modelling studies have shown that these schemes could lead to a slow-down in the global hydrological cycle. Other problems such as changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle and ocean acidification remain unsolved by sunshade geoengineering schemes. In this article, I review the proposed geoengineering schemes, results from climate models and discuss why geoengineering is not the best option to deal with climate change.",1
"Nitrous oxide and N2 are the major denitrification products in irrigated corn (Zea mays L.). In addition, N2O is considered a gas that contributes to global warming and stratospheric O3 depletion. Minimizing N2O emissions in cropping systems is therefore an economic as well as an important environmental concern. In a 1989 field experiment, the nitrification inhibitor encapsulated calcium carbide (ECC) (0, 20, or 40 kg CaC2 ha-1) or nitrapyrin (0.5 L a.i. ha-1) was banded with urea (218 kg N ha-1) 7 wk after planting corn. Between 1 and 14 wk after fertilization in 1989, N2O losses of 3226, 1109, 1017, and 1005 g N2O-N ha-1 from urea alone, urea plus nitrapyrin, urea plus 20 kg ECC ha-1, and urea plus 40 kg ECC ha-1, respectively, were measured from vented chambers. Nitrous oxide fluxes were positively correlated with soil NO3 levels, indicating that the nitrification inhibitors indirectly controlled N2O emissions by preventing NO3 from accumulating in the soil. Carbon dioxide emissions from the root zone were generally not affected by ECC or nitrapyrin. In 1990, losses of N2O were less than in 1989 (1651 g N ha-1 with urea alone), probably because there were fewer irrigations. Nitrapyrin and ECC addition to urea resulted in 980 and 459 g N ha-1 N2O being emitted the second year. Nitrification inhibitors appear to be a useful tool in mitigating N2O emissions in agricultural systems.",1
"Environmental monitoring of national-level comparisons of CO2 emissions is needed to quantify sources and sinks of carbon ( C) in national ecosystems. In this study, a national forest inventory database was used to estimate the past and current pools and fluxes of C in deciduous and coniferous forest and woodland ecosystems (20.7 x 10(6) ha) of Turkey. Growing C stock was 12.63 t C ha(-1) in 1960 and 16.55 t C ha(-1) in 1995. Total C store in the whole live woody biomass was estimated at 22.77 t C ha(-1) in 1996. The total flux of C from the atmosphere into the forest and woodland ecosystems driven by primary productivity was about 46 t C ha(-1) (or 30.2 Mt C) in 1996. The estimated net release of C from the forest and woodland ecosystems of Turkey to the atmosphere was about 34 t C ha(-1) ( or 25 Mt C) in 1996. When C released was taken into account, net ecosystem sequestration (NES) resulted in 0.12 t C ha(-1) per year. Such analytical tools as national forest C budgets are needed to improve our preventive and mitigative strategies for dealing with global climate change.",1
"Exchange of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from soils can contribute significantly to the global warming potential (GWP) of agro-ecosystems. Due to variations in soil type, climatic conditions and land management practices, exchange of CO(2) can differ markedly in different geographical locations. The food industry is developing carbon footprints for their products necessitating integration of CO(2) exchange from soils with other CO(2) emissions along the food chain. It may be advantageous to grow certain crops in different geographical locations to minimize CO(2) emissions from the soil, and this may provide potential to offset other emissions in the food chain, such as transport. Values are derived for the C balance of soils growing horticultural crops in the UK, Spain and Uganda. Net ecosystem production (NEP) is firstly calculated from the difference in net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic soil respiration (R(h)). Both NPP and R(h) were estimated from intensive direct field measurements. Secondly, net biome production (NBP) is calculated by subtracting the crop biomass from NEP to give an indication of C balance. The importance of soil exchange is discussed in the light of recent discussions on carbon footprints and within the context of food life-cycle assessment (LCA). The amount of crop relative to the biomass and the R(h) prevailing in the different countries were the dominant factors influencing the magnitude of NEP and NBP. The majority of the biomass for lettuce Lactuca sativa and vining peas Pisum sativum, was removed from the field as crop; therefore, NEP and NBP were mainly negative. This was amplified for lettuces grown in Uganda (-16.5 and -17 t C ha(-1) year(-1) compared to UK and Spain -4.8 to 7.4 and -5.1 to 6.3 t C ha(-1) year(-1) for NEP and NBP, respectively) where the climate elevated R(h). Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the importance of soil emissions in the overall life cycle of vegetables. Variability in such emissions suggests that assigning a single value to food carbon footprints may not be adequate, even within a country. Locations with high heterotrophic soil respiration, such as Spain and Uganda (29 and 26 t C ha(-1) year(-1), respectively), could mitigate the negative effects of climate on the C costs of crop production by growth of crops with greater returns of residue to the soil. This would minimize net CO(2) emissions from these agricultural ecosystems.",1
"The world's sandy beaches, already eroding at rates of concern to coastal managers, are facing a further threat based on predictions of global climate change. Although mean sea level rise has long been recognized as a likely consequence of climate change, it has been suggested that there may also be a change in ocean storminess-that is, the intensity and frequency of storm events. While the effects of a change in wave height can be handled with existing analysis methods, the effects of a change in the rate at which storms arrive are less obvious and harder to predict. As a prelude to model studies investigating coastal response to changes in storminess, it is necessary to have a reliable method for generating storm and wave histories that contain waves that not only conform to known distributions of height and period but that also arrive at the proper rate in time. In the current work a statistical model of the arrival rate of storms and the wave heights within those storms has been developed. Storminess can be modelled by describing interstorm period, storm duration, the average wave height, and the temporal distribution of storm significant wave heights using methods that have been applied in rainfall modelling. The model has been verified against existing wave climate parameters of wave exceedence and wave persistence, and it has been shown to reproduce these statistics reliably.",1
"Historical climate simulations of the period 1861-2000 using two new Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global climate models (CM2.0 and CM2.1) are compared with observed surface temperatures. All-forcing runs include the effects of changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases, ozone, sulfates, black and organic carbon, volcanic aerosols, solar flux, and land cover. Indirect effects of tropospheric aerosols on clouds and precipitation processes are not included. Ensembles of size 3 (CM2.0) and 5 (CM2.1) with all forcings are analyzed, along with smaller ensembles of natural-only and anthropogenic-only forcing, and multicentury control runs with no external forcing. Observed warming trends on the global scale and in many regions are simulated more realistically in the all-forcing and anthropogenic-only forcing runs than in experiments using natural-only forcing or no external forcing. In the all-forcing and anthropogenic-only forcing runs, the model shows some tendency for too much twentieth-century warming in lower latitudes and too little warming in higher latitudes. Differences in Arctic Oscillation behavior between models and observations contribute substantially to an underprediction of the observed warming over northern Asia. In the all-forcing and natural-only forcing runs, a temporary global cooling in the models during the 1880s not evident in the observed temperature records is volcanically forced. El Nino interactions complicate comparisons of observed and simulated temperature records for the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions during the early 1980s and early 1990s. The simulations support previous findings that twentieth-century global warming has resulted from a combination of natural and anthropogenic forcing, with anthropogenic forcing being the dominant cause of the pronounced late-twentieth-century warming. The regional results provide evidence for an emergent anthropogenic warming signal over many, if not most, regions of the globe. The warming signal has emerged rather monotonically in the Indian Ocean/western Pacific warm pool during the past half-century. The tropical and subtropical North Atlantic and the tropical eastern Pacific are examples of regions where the anthropogenic warming signal now appears to be emerging from a background of more substantial multidecadal variability.",1
"The boreal forests of Scandinavia offer a considerable resource base, and use of the resource for the production of less carbon-intensive alternative transport fuel is one strategy being considered in Norway. Here, we quantify the resource potential and investigate the environmental implications of wood-based transportation relative to a fossil reference system for a specific region in Norway. We apply a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment to evaluate four E85 production system designs based on two distinct wood-to-ethanol conversion technologies. We form best and worst case scenarios to assess the sensitivity of impact results through the adjustment of key parameters, such as biomass-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and upstream biomass transport distance. Depending on the system design, global warming emission reductions of 46% to 68% per-MJ-gasoline avoided can be realized in the region, along with reductions in most of the other environmental impact categories considered. We find that the region's surplus forest-bioenergy resources are vast; use for the production of bioethanol today would have resulted in the displacement of 55% to 68% of the region's gasoline-based global warming emission-or 6% to 8% of Norway's total global warming emissions associated with road transportation.",1
"Plasma reforming and coupling of methane with carbon dioxide using a point-to-point typo of reactor have been invested. A feed mixture of CH(4) and CO(2) could be converted mainly to CO, H(2), and C(2)H(2) at atmospheric pressure and without external heating except plasma heating. Under a condition of 200 mL/min of CH(4) and CO(2) (CH(4):CO(2) volume ratio, 50:50), a 2.5 min discharge gap, and a pulse frequency of 10.3 kPPS, CH(4) and CO(2) conversion, CO and C(2)H(2) selectivities, H(2)/CO ratio, and (CH(4) + CO(2)) conversion efficiency were 65.9% and 57.8%, 85.9% and 13%, 0.99, and 2.4 mmol/kJ, respectively. C(2)H(2) selectivity and H(2)/CO ratio could be moderated by changing CH(4) concentration in the feed mixture. The influence, of methane concentration and pulse frequency on product selectivity and plasma energy efficiency was evaluated. A brief economic evaluation of this process was given. The coproduction of acetylene of high value remarkably improved the production of synthesis gas (CO + H(2)) from carbon dioxide reforming of methane, which could also contribute the emission reduction of global warming gas CO(2).",1
"Greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulphate aerosols-the main human influences on climate-have been shown to have had a detectable effect on surface air temperature(1-3), the temperature of the free troposphere and stratosphere(2,4) and ocean temperature(5,6) Nevertheless, the question remains as to whether human influence is detectable in any variable other than temperature. Here we detect an influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols in observations of winter sea-level pressure (December to February), using combined simulations from four climate models. We find increases in sea-level pressure over the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean, southern Europe and North Africa, and decreases in the polar regions and the North Pacific Ocean, in response to human influence. Our analysis also indicates that the climate models substantially underestimate the magnitude of the sea-level pressure response. This discrepancy suggests that the upward trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation index(7) (corresponding to strengthened westerlies in the North Atlantic region), as simulated in a number of global warming scenarios(8-10), may be too small, leading to an underestimation of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on European climate.",1
"Solar generation systems are one of the measures for reducing global warming. An installed capacity target of solar generation systems in our country will be set 4.82 GW in 2010, while the total installed capacity is still 92 GW in 2007. About 80% of the systems are mainly residential use and each is very small. Constructions of some large-scale solar generation systems will be expected and intensive development of related technologies are urgent.

"Current global warming has been linked to increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. Animal manure is an important source of anthropogenic GHG, mostly of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Country-specific emission estimates of these GHG can be obtained using IPCC 2000 guidelines, or suggested improvement, such as the USEPA approach for CH4 emissions, which is based on monthly air temperature (T-air). These approaches have not been validated against measured CH4 and N2O fluxes for liquid swine manure storage in cold climates due to the scarcity of year-round studies. A four-tower micrometeorological mass balance method was used at three swine farms (Arkell, Guelph, and Jarvis) in Ontario, Canada (annual T-air < 10 degrees C, from July 2000 to May 2002. Methane and N2O concentrations were measured using two tunable diode laser trace gas analyzers, and manure temperature (T-man), redox potential (E-h) and composition were also measured. Dry matter content and Eh between sites and seasons varied from 0.6% to 3%, and -232 and -333 mV, respectively. Annual T-air was 8.4 degrees C, and T-man was on average 4 degrees C warmer. Mean N2O fluxes were not significantly different from zero, except for Jarvis with mean fluxes of 337.6 ng m(-2) s(-1) in summer and 108 ng m(-2)s(-1) in fall. Mean yearly N2O emission was estimated as 3.6 g head(-1) yr(-1), and was lower than the IPCC-based emission factor (EF) of 17 g head(-1) yr(-1). Our data suggests that N2O emissions from non-aerated liquid swine manure storage could be ignored in GHG inventories. Mean monthly CH4 fluxes obtained from half-hourly data varied between 4.6 x 10(-3) and 05 mgm(-2)s(-1) (number of measurements per month = 25-562). Measured CH4 emissions from May to October were mostly larger, and from January to April were lower than values predicted using the USEPA approach. Use of Tman improved monthly CH4 emission prediction using the USEPA approach compared to T-air with a lower limit of 7.5 degrees C (r(2) = 0.64 vs. 0.355). The methane conversion factor derived from measured fluxes was 0.23, comparable to the USEPA derived values of 0.22-0.25, but much lower than the IPCC recommended value for cold climates (0.39).

"Environmental influences on the cultivation of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants, which are especially well adapted to arid regions with limited rainfall, were evaluated with respect to two aspects of global climate change. Cellular uptake of a vital stain, which occurs in living cells only, was halved at -6+/-1 degrees C for the cultivated CAM species Agave salmiana, Opuntia ficus indica and Stenocereus queretaroensis growing at day/night air temperatures of 30 degrees C/20 degrees C compared with -12 degrees C for the wild species Opuntia humifusa. When plants were grown at reduced temperatures of 10 degrees C/0 degrees C, stain uptake was halved at about -8 degrees C for the cultivated species but at -24 degrees C for O. humifusa. The greater low-temperature sensitivity and the lesser low-temperature acclimation of the cultivated species severely limit the regions where they can presently be grown, but such regions will expand as air temperatures rise accompanying global climate change. When the atmospheric CO2 concentration was doubled from the current ambient value of 360 mu mol mol(-1) to 7201 mu mol mol(-1), net CO2 uptake over 24-h periods increased 36% for A. salmiana and S. queretaroensis; about one-third of the increase resulted from higher net CO2 uptake rates in the last 4 h of daytime and two-thirds from higher rates during the first 8 h of the night. The doubled atmospheric CO, concentration predicted to occur before the end of the twenty-first century will increase CO2 uptake and hence biomass productivity of such CAM species, further expanding the regions where they may be profitably cultivated.

"Recent research has suggested that warmer conditions, that may result from increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, may induce the growth of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (Miller and de Vernal 1992) through the impact of warmer temperature on the water carrying capacity of the atmosphere and thus on precipitation. In this study we examine this possibility by using a coupled energy balance climate-thermodynamic sea ice model. Results indicate that if summer ice albedo is high enough, and there is some mechanism for initially maintaining ice through the summer season, then it may be possible to have ice sheet growth under the conditions of CO2 induced warming.",1
"Global concern over increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere leading to possible future climate changes have generated interest in offsetting CO2 emissions by storing carbon in forests. Carbon-sequestering forest activities may be one of the least expensive approaches to mitigate the build up of atmospheric CO2. However, the fact that forest management practices are species-, site-and management-objective-specific increases the complexity of using the forestry sector to mitigate global warming. In order to provide useful and timely information concerning carbon sequestration, this study investigated three forestry-based opportunities for sequestering carbon in the United States: conversion of marginal agricultural land to forests and reforestation of poorly stocked pine plantations in the South, afforestation of the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), and reclamation and afforestation of abandoned mined lands (AML). This study conducted economic analyses on three region -species combinations: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) in the southern states, cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) in the LMAV, and northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) on AML in West Virginia. The objectives of this study were to determine the profitability of managing these three commercial tree species for timber production only and for the combination of timber production and carbon sequestration and then calculate net tonnes of carbon stored during one rotation and net revenues generated from each tonne of carbon sequestered.",1
"In this study, we investigated the impact of global warming on the variabilities of large-scale interannual and interdecadal climate modes and teleconnection patterns with two long-term integrations of the coupled general circulation model of ECHAM4/OPYC3 at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg. One is the control (CTRL) run with fixed present-day; concentrations of greenhouse gases. The other experiment is a simulation of transient greenhouse warming, named GHG run. In the GHG run the averaged geopotential height at 500 hPa is increased significantly, and a negative phase of the Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection-like distribution pattern is intensified. The standard deviation over the tropics thigh latitudes) is enhanced (reduced) on the interdecadal time scales and reduced (enhanced) on the interannual time scales in the GHG run. Except for an interdecadal mode related to the Southern Oscillation (SO) in the GHG run, the spatial variation patterns are similar for different (interannual + interdecadal, interannual, and interdecadal) time scales in the GHG and CTRL runs. Spatial distributions of the teleconnection patterns on the interannual and interdecadal time scales in the GHG run are also similar to those in the CTRL run. But some teleconnection patterns show linear trends and changes of variances and frequencies in the GHG run. Apart from the positive linear trend of the SO, the interdecadal modulation to the El Nino/SO cycle is enhanced during the GHG 2040 similar to 2099. This is the result of an enhancement of the Walker circulation during that period. La Nino events intensify and El Nino events relatively weaken during the GHG 2070 similar to 2090. It is interesting to note that with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations the relation between the SO and the PNA pattern is reversed significantly from a negative to a positive correlation on the interdecadal time scales and weakened on the interannual time scales. This suggests that the increase of the greenhouse gas concentrations will trigger the nonstationary correlation between the SO and the PNA pattern both on the interdecadal and interannual time scales.",1

"A modified Budyko global vegetation model is used to predict changes in global vegetation patterns resulting from climate change (CO2 doubling). Vegetation patterns are predicted using a model based on a dryness index and potential evaporation determined by solving radiation balance equations. Climate change scenarios are derived from predictions from four General Circulation Models (GCM's) of the atmosphere (GFDL, GISS, OSU, and UKMO). Global vegetation maps after climate change are compared to the current climate vegetation map using the kappa statistic for judging agreement, as well as by calculating area statistics. All four GCM scenarios show similar trends in vegetation shifts and in areas that remain stable, although the UKMO scenario predicts greater warming than the others. Climate change maps produced by all four GCM scenarios show good agreement with the current climate vegetation map for the globe as a whole, although over half of the vegetation classes show only poor to fair agreement. The most stable areas are Desert and Ice/Polar Desert. Because most of the predicted warming is concentrated in the Boreal and Temperate zones, vegetation there is predicted to undergo the greatest change. Specifically, all Boreal vegetation classes are predicted to shrink. The interrelated classes of Tundra, Taiga, and Temperate Forest are predicted to replace much of their poleward mostly northern) neighbors. Most vegetation classes in the Subtropics and Tropics are predicted to expand. Any shift in the Tropics favoring either Forest over Savanna, or vice versa, will be determined by the magnitude of the increased precipitation accompanying global warming. Although the model predicts equilibrium conditions to which many plant species cannot adjust (through migration or microevolution) in the 50-100 y needed for CO2 doubling, it is nevertheless not clear if projected global warming will result in drastic or benign vegetation change.",1
"This paper introduces the three-dimensional Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA), which treats atmospheric dynamics, radiation, and chemistry interactively for the height range from the earth's surface to the thermosphere ( approximately 250 km). It is based on the latest version of the ECHAM atmospheric general circulation model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, which is extended to include important radiative and dynamical processes of the upper atmosphere and is coupled to a chemistry module containing 48 compounds. The model is applied to study the effects of natural and anthropogenic climate forcing on the atmosphere, represented, on the one hand, by the 11-yr solar cycle and, on the other hand, by a doubling of the present-day concentration of carbon dioxide. The numerical experiments are analyzed with the focus on the effects on temperature and chemical composition in the mesopause region. Results include a temperature response to the solar cycle by 2 to 10 K in the mesopause region with the largest values occurring slightly above the summer mesopause. Ozone in the secondary maximum increases by up to 20% for solar maximum conditions. Changes in winds are in general small. In the case of a doubling of carbon dioxide the simulation indicates a cooling of the atmosphere everywhere above the tropopause but by the smallest values around the mesopause. It is shown that the temperature response up to the mesopause is strongly influenced by changes in dynamics. During Northern Hemisphere summer, dynamical processes alone would lead to an almost global warming of up to 3 K in the uppermost mesosphere.",1
"This paper is based on a review of the technical literature on alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and discussions with experts in vehicle technology and energy analysis. It is derived from analysis provided to the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy. The urgent need to reverse the business-as-usual growth path in global warming pollution in the next two decades to avoid serious if not catastrophic climate change necessitates action to make our vehicles far less polluting. In the near-term, by far the most cost-effective strategy for reducing emissions and fuel use is efficiency. The car of the near future is the hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle, because it can reduce gasoline consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 30 to 50% with no change in vehicle class and hence no loss of jobs or compromise on safety or performance. It will likely become the dominant vehicle platform by the year 2020. Ultimately, we will need to replace gasoline with a zero-carbon fuel. All AFV pathways require technology advances and strong government action to succeed. Hydrogen is the most challenging of all alternative fuels, particularly because of the enormous effort needed to change our existing gasoline infrastructure. The most promising AFV pathway is a hybrid that can be connected to the electric grid. These so-called plug-in hybrids or e-hybrids will likely travel three to four times as far on a kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity as fuel cell vehicles. Ideally these advanced hybrids would also be a flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on a blend of biofuels and gasoline. Such a car could travel 500 miles on 1 gal of gasoline (and 5 gal of cellulosic ethanol) and have under one-tenth the greenhouse gas emissions of current hybrids. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Anthropogenic changes in temperature and stream flow, associated with watershed land use and climate change, are critical influences on the distribution and abundance of riverine fishes. To project the effects of changing land use and climate, we modeled a smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) population in a midwestern USA, large river-floodplain ecosystem under historical (1915-1925), present (1977-1990), and future (2060, influenced by climate change) temperature and flow regimes. The age-structured model included parameters for temperature and river discharge during critical seasonal periods, fish population dynamics, and fishing harvest. Model relationships were developed from empirical field data collected over a 13-yr period. Sensitivity analyses indicated that discharge during the spawning/rearing period had a greater effect on adult density and fishing yield than did spawning/rearing temperature or winter discharge. Simulations for 100 years projected a 139% greater mean fish density under a historical flow regime (64.9 fish/ha) than that estimated for the present (27.1 fish/ha) with a sustainable fishing harvest under both flow regimes. Simulations under future climate-change-induced temperature and flow regimes with present land use projected a 69% decrease in mean fish density (8.5 fish/ha) from present and an unstable population that went extinct during 56% of the simulations. However, when simulated under a future climate-altered temperature and flow regime with historical land use, the population increased by 66% (45.0 fish/ha) from present and sustained a harvest. Our findings suggest that land-use changes may be a greater detriment to riverine fishes than projected climate change and that the combined effects of both factors may lead to local species extinction. However, the negative effects of increased temperature and precipitation associated with future global warming could be mitigated by river channel, floodplain, and watershed restoration.",1
"The effect of climate change by the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide on terrestrial ecosystems has attracted much attention. For estimating these effects quantitatively, model that expresses the global carbon cycle is needed. We constructed models a express vegetation growth and carbon cycle in soil. In this report, by using these two models, we estimated the carbon cycle between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere and predicted the effects on the global carbon cycle. By this model we can predict that terrestrial ecosystems emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere with increase of temperature.",1
"This paper reviews problems connected to the use of the deep-sea and sub-sea geological formations for carbon sequestration. We will focus on the risks and dangers involved in using this kind of large-scale engineering approach, which is not yet fully tested, to combat global warming. We will not provide a complete discussion on the technologies involved, but concentrate on a few principal questions, such as the responsibility of environmental scientists involved in this research. We will also discuss carbon sequestration in relation to the precautionary approach. We argue that there may be a place for large-scale engineering attempts, but this should be the last rather than the first option.",1
"The Hamburg atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM3 at T106 resolution (125 degrees lat./lon.) has considerable skill in reproducing the observed seasonal reversal of mean sea level pressure, the location of the summer heat low as well as the position of the monsoon trough over the Indian subcontinent. The present-day climate and its seasonal cycle are realistically simulated by the model over this region. The model simulates the structure, intensity, frequency, movement and lifetime of monsoon depressions remarkably well. The number of monsoon depressions/storms simulated by the model in a year ranged from 5 to 12 with an average frequency of 8.4 yr(-1), not significantly different from the observed climatology. The model also simulates the interannual variability in the formation of depressions over the north Bay of Bengal during the summer monsoon season. In the warmer atmosphere under doubled CO2 conditions, the number of monsoon depressions/cyclonic storms forming in Indian seas in a year ranged from 5 to 11 with an average frequency of 7.6 yr(-1), not significantly different from those inferred in the control run of the model. However, under doubled CO2 conditions, fewer depressions formed in the month of June. Neither the lowest central pressure nor the maximum windspeed changes appreciably in monsoon depressions identified under simulated enhanced greenhouse conditions. The analysis suggests there will be no significant changes in the number and intensity of monsoon depressions in a warmer atmosphere.",1
"We analysed the evolution of drought on the NW Iberian Peninsula from 1930 to 2006, and identified differences between the effects of precipitation variability and warming processes on drought severity and surface water resources. Two drought indices were used, one based on precipitation (the standardised precipitation index, SPI) and the other based on water balance, as reflected by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, PET (the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI). The results show that precipitation has increased in the region, but a significant increase has also occurred in PET. No statistically significant differences were found over the study period for the severity of drought, as assessed by both the SPI and SPEI. In addition, although in the last 3 decades the mean duration of drought episodes has increased by approximately 1 mo as a consequence of the increase of the PET rates, the differences are not statistically significant. River discharge is mainly driven by precipitation variability, whereas warming processes did not have a noticeable influence on the streamflow variability between 1930 and 2006. The implications of global warming projected by global climate models on future drought severity and the availability of water resources are highly relevant in the near future.",1
"Using CRU high resolution grid observational temperature and ERA40 reanalysis surface air temperature data during 1960-1999, we investigated the sensitivity of surface air temperature change to land use/cover types in China by subtracting the reanalysis from the observed surface air temperature (observation minus reanalysis, OMR). The results show that there is a stable and systemic impact of land use/cover types on surface air temperature. The surface warming of each land use/cover type reacted differently to global warming. The OMR trends of unused land (a (c) 3/40.17 A degrees C/decade), mainly comprised by sandy land, Gobi and bare rock gravel land, are obviously larger than those of the other land use/cover types. The OMR over grassland, farmland and construction land shows a moderate decadal warmingabout 0.12A degrees C/decade, 0.10A degrees C/decade, 0.12A degrees C/decade, respectively. Woodland areas do not show a significant warming trend (0.06A degrees C/decade). The overall assessment indicates that the surface warming is larger for areas that are barren and anthropogenically developed. The better the vegetation cover, the smaller the OMR warming trend. Responses of surface air temperature to land use/cover types with similar physical and chemical properties and biological processes have no significant difference. The surface air temperature would not react significantly until the intensity of land cover changes reach a certain degree. Within the same land use/cover type, areas in eastern China with intensive human activities exhibit larger warming trend. The results provide observational evidence for modeling research on the impact of land use/cover change on regional climate. Thus, projecting further surface climate of China in regional scale should not only take greenhouse gas increase into account, but also consider the impact of land use/cover types and land cover change.",1
"The WAVES model was used to simulate the effect of global warming on soil moisture on the semi-arid Taihang Mountain in China. Parameters of the WAVES model were first adjusted according to soil moisture data from a field global warming experiment. Then, the reliability of WAVES in predicting soil moisture changes induced by climatic change was confirmed by comparing the simulated and observed soil moisture values under different climatic conditions and plant growth rates of another field treatment. Next, 10 climate change scenarios incorporating increases in temperature and changes in precipitation were designed. When a simulation was conducted using the leaf area index (LAI) growth pattern from a field experiment under the present climatic conditions, the results suggested that the combination of temperature increase and precipitation decrease would greatly decrease soil water content throughout the entire simulation period. On the other hand, only when precipitation increased by 20% and temperature increased by 2 degreesC, the effect of precipitation increase on soil moisture was obviously positive. Although soil moisture conditions in the T2P1 (temperature increase by 2degreesC and precipitation increase by 10%) and T4P2 (temperature increase by 4degreesC and precipitation increase by 20%) scenarios were slightly better during the rainy season and not much changed before the rainy season, the positive effect of 10% precipitation increase on soil moisture was totally offset by moisture decrease caused by a 4degreesC temperature increase in the T4P1 scenario. At the same time, the trends of soil-moisture change were highly coincident with predicted changes in productivity. Finally, the predicted LAI values from other studies were combined with the climatic change scenarios and used in the simulation. The results showed that changes in LAI alleviated, at least to some extent, the effects of temperature and precipitation changes on soil moisture.",1
"Increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are widely expected to cause global warming and other climatic changes. It is important to establish priorities for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, so that resources can be allocated efficiently and effectively. This is a global problem, and it is possible, on a global scale, to identify those activities whose emissions have the greatest potential for enhancing the greenhouse effect. However, perspectives from smaller scales must be appreciated, because it is on scales down to the local level that response measures will be implemented, This paper analyzes the relative importance of emissions from the many individual sources, on scales ranging from global to national to subnational. Individual country perspectives and proposed policy measures and those of subnational political entities exhibit some commonalities but differ among themselves and from a global-scale perspective in detail.",1
"In developing countries like India, urban solid waste (SW) generation is increasing enormously and most of the SWs are disposed off by land filling in low-lying areas, resulting into generation of large quantities of biogas. Methane, the major constituent gas is known to cause global warming due to green house gas (GHG) effect. There is a need to study the ever-increasing contribution of SW to the global GHG effect. To assess the impacts, estimation of GHG emission is must and to avoid misguidance by these emission-data, qualitative assessment of the estimated GHG is a must. In this paper, methane emission is estimated for a particular landfill site, using default methodology and modified triangular methodology. Total methane generation is same for both theoretical methodologies, but the modified triangular method has an upper hand as it provides a time-dependent emission profile that reflects the true pattern of the degradation process. To check the quality of calculated emission-data, extensive sampling is carried out for different seasons in a year. Field results show a different trend as compared to theoretical results, this compels for logical thinking. Each methane emission-data is backed up by the uncertainty associated with it, this further strengthens the quality check of these data. Uncertainty calculation is done using Monte Carlo simulation technique, recommended in IPCC Guideline. In the due course of qualitative assessment of methane emission-data, many site-specific sensitive parameters are discovered and are briefly discussed in this paper. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"In recent years, much attention has focused on the potential environmental effects of global climate change, but other anthropogenic impacts might be even more important. A new study by Tilman et A highlights the threat posed to natural ecosystems worldwide by increasing agricultural development. Over the next 50 years, model projections suggest that rates of habitat destruction, water consumption and emission of agricultural pollutants will increase drastically. Such changes will be greatest in developing nations, which sustain a disproportionately large fraction of the Earth's biological diversity.",1
"Past variations of water levels at Cuxhaven, Germany (German bight), are examined, and a scenario for future changes due to expected global warming is derived. The observational record of Cuxhaven water levels features a linear upward trend in the annual mean water level of about 30 cm 100 yr(-1) overlaid by irregular variations due to synoptic disturbances. These irregular storm-related variations are shown to have remained mostly stationary since the beginning of observations until today. A scenario for future conditions is derived by means of a two-step downscaling approach. First,a ''time slice experiment'' is used to obtain a regionally disaggregated scenario for the time mean circulation for the time of expected doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Then, an empirical downscaling model is derived, which relates intramonthly percentiles of storm-related water-level variations at Cuxhaven to variations in the monthly mean air pressure field over Europe and the northern North Atlantic. Past variations of storm-related intramonthly percentiles are well reproduced by the downscaling model so that the statistical model may be credited with skill. The combined time slice-statistical model ''predicts,'' for the expect time of doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the decade around 2035, an insignificant rise of the 50%, 80%, and 90% percentiles of storm-related water-level variations in Cuxhaven of less than 10 cm, which is well within the range of natural interdecadal variability. These numbers have to be added to the rise in mean sea level due to thermal expansion and other slow processes.",1
"General circulation models (GCMs) are unanimous in projecting warmer temperatures in an enhanced CO2 atmosphere, with amplification of this warming in higher latitudes. The Hudson Bay region, which is located in the Arctic and subarctic regions of Canada, should therefore be strongly influenced by global warming. In this study, we compare the response of Hudson Bay to a transient warming scenario provided by six-coupled atmosphere-ocean models. Our analysis focuses on surface temperature, precipitation, sea-ice coverage, and permafrost distribution. The results show that warming is expected to peak in winter over the ocean, because of a northward retreat of the sea-ice cover. Also, a secondary warming peak is observed in summer over land in the Canadian and Australian-coupled GCMs, which is associated with both a reduction in soil moisture conditions and changes in permafrost distribution. In addition, a relationship is identified between the retreat of the sea-ice cover and an enhancement of precipitation over both land and oceanic surfaces. The response of the sea-ice cover and permafrost layer to global warming varies considerably among models and thus large differences are observed in the projected regional increase in temperature and precipitation. In view of the important feedbacks that a retreat of the sea-ice cover and the distribution of permafrost are likely to play in the doubled and tripled CO2 climates of Hudson Bay, a good representation of these two parameters is necessary to provide realistic climate change scenarios. The use of higher resolution regional climate model is recommended to develop scenarios of climate change for the Hudson Bay region.",1
"'Hyperthermals' are intervals of rapid, pronounced global warming known from six episodes within the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs (similar to 65-34 million years (Myr) ago)(1-13). The most extreme hyperthermal was the 170 thousand year (kyr) interval(2) of 5-7 degrees C global warming(3) during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 Myr ago). The PETM is widely attributed to massive release of greenhouse gases from buried sedimentary carbon reservoirs(1,3,6,11,14-17), and other, comparatively modest, hyperthermals have also been linked to the release of sedimentary carbon(3,6,11,16,17). Here we show, using new 2.4-Myr-long Eocene deep ocean records, that the comparatively modest hyperthermals are much more numerous than previously documented, paced by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and have shorter durations (40 kyr) and more rapid recovery phases than the PETM. These findings point to the operation of fundamentally different forcing and feedback mechanisms than for the PETM, involving redistribution of carbon among Earth's readily exchangeable surface reservoirs rather than carbon exhumation from, and subsequent burial back into, the sedimentary reservoir. Specifically, we interpret our records to indicate repeated, large-scale releases of dissolved organic carbon (at least 1,600 giga-tonnes) from the ocean by ventilation (strengthened oxidation) of the ocean interior. The rapid recovery of the carbon cycle following each Eocene hyperthermal strongly suggests that carbon was re-sequestered by the ocean, rather than the much slower process of silicate rock weathering proposed for the PETM1,3. Our findings suggest that these pronounced climate warming events were driven not by repeated releases of carbon from buried sedimentary sources(3,6,11,16,17), but, rather, by patterns of surficial carbon redistribution familiar from younger intervals of Earth history.",1
"Conventional oil and natural gas production were compared with two case studies of enhanced resource recovery along with the potential for CO2 sequestration applications. The first case study is a Norwegian enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project, and the second focuses on enhanced coal-bed methane (ECBM) recovery in Japan. Both cases or systems involved the recovery of CO2 gases from a coal-fired power plant, followed by compression, transportation, and final injection of the greenhouse gas into geological formations as a solution to mitigate global warming. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) method was applied to measure how each system, conventional as well as enhanced recovery methods, impacts the environment. The first set of results presented were the inventory of air emissions (CO, CO2, CH4, SOx, NOx, NH3, Pb, Hg, etc.), wastewater-containing acids and sulfides, and solid wastes released because of both fossil fuel production and energy usage from the power plant. The impact assessment results because of the accumulated pollutants from all of the systems were calculated for the following set of common impact measures: global warming potential, acidification, human toxicity, eutrophication, wastes, and resources. The final (combined) scores of the entire system were also generated. These final scores, which included the normalization and weighting steps, allowed for overall comparisons for verifying the final benefits or drawbacks of a system. For the proposed EOR project, the greatest two environmental benefits (total impacts prevented) were calculated to be -9.8 x 10(-2) and -9.7 x 10(-2). As for ECBM, the best scores were projected to be -0 x 10(-1) followed by -8.70 x 10(-2).",1
"Mediterranean mountains harbour some of Europe's highest floristic richness. This is accounted for largely by the mesoclimatic variety in these areas, along with the co-occurrence of a small area of Eurosiberian, Boreal and Mediterranean species, and those of Tertiary Subtropical origin. Throughout the twenty-first century, we are likely to witness a climate change-related modification of the biogeographic scenario in these mountains, and there is therefore a need for accurate climate regionalisations to serve as a reference of the abundance and distribution of species and communities, particularly those of a relictic nature. This paper presents an objective mapping method focussing on climate regions in a mountain range. The procedure was tested in the Cordillera Central Mountains of the Iberian Peninsula, in the western Mediterranean, one of the ranges occupying the largest area of the Mediterranean Basin. This regionalisation is based upon multivariate analyses and upon detailed cartography employing 27 climatic variables. We used spatial interpolation of data based on geographic information. We detected high climatic diversity in the mountain range studied. We identified 13 climatic regions, all of which form a varying mosaic throughout the annual temperature and rainfall cycle. This heterogeneity results from two geographically opposed gradients. The first one is the Mediterranean-Euro-Siberian variation of the mountain range. The second gradient involves the degree of oceanicity, which is negatively related to distance from the Atlantic Ocean. The existing correlation between the climatic regions detected and the flora existing therein enables the results to be situated within the projected trends of global warming, and their biogeographic and ecological consequences to be analysed.",1
"Methane is the main component of natural gas and has been connected with global warming. The oxidative coupling of methane has been studied to enhance C-2 hydrocarbon selectivity and to reduce the formation of carbon oxides associated with C-2 hydrocarbon production. Acid sites of supported catalysts play a role in the formation of carbon oxides. The supported Zn oxide catalyst with alpha-Al2O3 shows no acidity in temperature programmed desorption by using NH3 and exhibits good C-2 hydrocarbon selectivity. The optimum loading of Zn oxide on alpha-Al2O3 is 60 wt%. The specific surface area of the catalyst appears not to influence activity. Using alkali metal salts as promoter in Zn oxide (60 Wt%)/alpha-Al2O3 catalyst, the activity performance for C-2 hydrocarbon formation is LiCl > NaCl > KCl: the performance is well correlated with the apparent molal enthalpy of formation of halides. The activity performance for minimizing carbon oxides is LiCl > KCl > NaCl, which is well correlated with the melting points in alkali halides.",1
"Aerosols affect the Earth's temperature and climate by altering the radiative properties of the atmosphere. A large positive component of this radiative forcing from aerosols is due to black carbon-soot-that is released from the burning of fossil fuel and biomass, and, to a lesser extent, natural fires, but the exact forcing is affected by how black carbon is mixed with other aerosol constituents. From studies of aerosol radiative forcing, it is known that black carbon can exist in one of several possible mixing states; distinct from other aerosol particles (externally mixed(1-7)) or incorporated within them (internally mixed(1,3,7)), or a black-carbon core could be surrounded by a well mixed shell 7. But so far it has been assumed that aerosols exist predominantly as an external mixture. Here I simulate the evolution of the chemical composition of aerosols, finding that the mixing state and direct forcing of the black-carbon component approach those of an internal mixture, largely due to coagulation and growth of aerosol particles. This finding implies a higher positive forcing from black carbon than previously thought, suggesting that the warming effect from black carbon may nearly balance the net cooling effect of other anthropogenic aerosol constituents. The magnitude of the direct radiative forcing from black carbon itself exceeds that due to CH4, suggesting that black carbon may be the second most important component of global warming after CO2 in terms of direct forcing.",1
"We estimated CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from the main land-use types in rural landscapes using data from the literature (950 study sites/experiments from the temperate and boreal zone published from 1980 to 2009 in 165 scientific papers indexed by the ISI Web of Science) and assessed the emission potential of CH(4) and N(2)O from rural landscapes in Estonia. According to this analysis, natural peatlands and marshes appeared to be the most important CH(4) emitters, whereas N(2)O is emitted mainly from drained peatlands and marshes, set aside areas, conventional arable lands, fertilized grasslands, and coniferous and mixed forests - all on hydromorphic soils. The estimated median value of annual CH(4)-C and N(2)O-N fluxes for Estonian rural landscapes are 25,519 and 11,050t respectively. CH(4) consumption makes up 13.2% of the emission. The largest CH(4) emitters are peatlands (17,746 tCH(4)-C year(-1); 60%), whereas coniferous and mixed forests on hydromorphic soils with altered hydrologic regime are responsible for the bulk (51%) of N(2)O fluxes. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of Estonian rural land-use types (42,685 km(2)) from potential CH(4) and N(2)O fluxes is 5.99 million t of CO(2) equivalents, of which N(2)O is responsible for 86%. Several measures for the further mitigation of greenhouse gas emission from rural landscapes are proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"For the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 1, using a simple climate/ocean model, we made projections of the greenhouse warming to 2100. Projections were made for four greenhouse-gas scenarios, whose radiative effects in 2100, expressed in terms of an equivalent amount of CO2, ranged from 2 to 5.5 times the pre-industrial CO2 concentration. The projected global warming in 2100 for these scenarios, relative to 1990, ranged from 0.62-2.31-degrees-C for the minimum assumed CO2-doubling temperature sensitivity, DELTA-T2x = 5-degrees-C, to 61-5.15-degrees-C for the maximum sensitivity DELTA-T2x = 4.5-degrees-C. Here we broaden these projections to include a recently suggested lower sensitivity, DELTA-T2x = 0.5-degrees-C. We also revise all projections by prescribing, using the results of our analysis of simulations by a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, a lower value for a key parameter of the simple ocean model, II, which indicates the warming of the polar ocean relative to the warming of the non-polar ocean. We find that, for any value of DELTA-T2x, the atmospheric temperature increases more rapidly with time as a consequence of the reduction in II. We also find that a delay of ten years in initiating a 20-year transition from the IPCC 'business-as-usual' scenario to any other IPCC scenario has only a small effect on the projected warming in 2100, regardless of the value of DELTA-T2x. This indicates that the penalty for a 10-year delay is small.",1
"This research article demonstrates the development of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for the generation of electrical energy by the aerobic fermentation of domestic wastewater (DWW) using the yeast as a culture of microorganisms. The power output of different configurations of MFCs using distilled water (DW), domestic wastewater (DWW) and fermented domestic wastewater (FDWW) was determined. The power output of FDWW was found to be greater than that of DWW and DW which showed that the fermentation of the organic matter present in a wastewater is the major cause of the generation of electrical energy. The highest power output (0.82 mW) was observed by the parallel combination of two units of double chamber open system MFC (DCOS-MFC). The main objective and scope of this research article is to investigate the environmental friendly alternatives of the production of energy which can overcome the global energy crisis, global pollution and global warming which are currently caused by the extensive use of fuels.",1
"Anthropogenic CH4 emissions are widely recognised as a world wide problem due to their global warming potential and because they represent a loss of dietary energy to ruminants. Few recent studies have examined medium or long term effects of methanogen inhibitors on rumen functional parameters and development of resistance to them. The aim of our study was to investigate medium term effects of a potent methanogen inhibitor on methanogen populations using molecular techniques and rumen function. Six rumen fistulated cows were divided into two groups and allocated to control and chloroform treatment and fed at a fixed rate of 8.4 kg dry matter (DM)/cow/d. After 7 d of acclimatization. treatment cows were dosed daily with 5 ml of chloroform in 30 ml of sunflower oil for 42 d, while control cows only received sunflower oil. Key indicators of rumen function monitored included rumen pH, rumen fill, apparent feed digestibility, apparent rumen digesta retention time, total protozoa numbers, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) and NH3 concentrations. Methane emissions were monitored using the SF6 tracer technique, and methanogens using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and four clone libraries. Methanogens and acetogens were monitored in a single cow by most probable number culturing methods. Chloroform, a known inhibitor of methanogenesis, resulted in an immediate and dramatic decrease in CH4 emissions and methanogen numbers, with the effect being most pronounced 1 wk after the start of the treatment. Thereafter, CH4 emissions increased slowly, reaching 62% of pre-treatment levels by d 42. The effect on CH4 emissions was reflected by a near complete disappearance of DGGE bands associated with methanogens in treated cows. This response was particularly obvious for Methanobrevibacter species. There were no effects of chloroform on apparent rumen digesta retention time, apparent feed digestibility, pH. NH3 or rumen fill. Total protozoa numbers tended to increase during the study in both groups. Total VFA concentrations did not change with chloroform treatment, but the acetate:propionate ratio during the period of dosing was lower (P<0.01) for treated cows (9) in the middle of the study (d 23) than in the control cows (2.7), but did not differ after treatment ceased at d 53. Despite profound effects of chloroform on CH4 emissions and methanogens, chloroform did not appear to alter basic rumen function. Whether a reduction in CH4 loss improves feed conversion efficiency requires further research using substances which have a sustained anti-methanogenic effect.

"Pig production systems often depend to a large extent on concentrated feed imported from outside the farm. This study used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method to assess major environmental impacts associated with the production and on-farm delivery of concentrated feed for pigs. Feed composition was based on average data for Bretagne (France) in 1998 and on published data for wheat-based, maize-based and co-product based feeds. As crop and feed production practices in Bretagne are similar to those in most of western Europe, we conclude that the results of this study apply more largely for western Europe. Depending on feed composition and fertilisation practise for crop-based feed ingredients, the production and delivery of one kg of feed for finishing pigs will produce a eutrophication potential between 3.8 and 9.3 g PO4-equivalents, a global warming potential between 472 and 792 g CO2-equivalents, an acidification potential between 3.0 and 6.3 g SO2-equivalents, a terrestrial ecotoxicity potential between 0.4 and 8.7 g 1,4-dichlorobenzene-equivalents, an energy use between 3.3 and 6.1 MJ, and land use between 44 and 2.07 m(2) year. These impacts are mainly due to the production of crop-based ingredients. The contribution of transport processes was substantial for climate change, acidification and energy use. A feed containing mainly co-products had higher energy use and lower terrestrial ecotoxicity than feeds consisting mainly of non-processed crop-based ingredients. Hypotheses with respect to the fertilisation practices for the feed's main ingredients have a major effect on its impact values. The effect of uncertainty concerning the emissions of N2O, NH3, and NO3 was very large for climate change, and large for acidification and eutrophication. The environmental burdens associated with the production and delivery of pig feed can be decreased by: optimising the fertilisation of its crop based ingredients, using more locally produced feed ingredients, reducing concentrations of Cu and Zn in the feed, and using wheat-based rather than maize-based feeds.

"Agricultural activities are important contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gases. This study ascertained the dynamic emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) from a paddy field under a rice-duck farming system in South China. Two different cultivation and fertilizer treatments, namely, organic fertilizer + ducks (OF+D) and chemical fertilizer + ducks (CF+D) treatments, were employed in this study. Experimental data showed that diurnal variations of N2O emission were highly correlated with the activities of ducklings. The rates of N2O emission were normally increased in the early morning and late afternoon due to the frequent movement of ducklings at these time periods. Our study further revealed that the rates of N2O emission from the paddy field varied with the types of fertilizers used as well as with the stages of the rice growth. In general, the rates of N2O emission were higher for the CF+D treatment than for the OF+D treatment, whereas more N2O was emitted from the paddy field at the tillering stage than at the heading stage. The global warming potential with the use of the organic fertilizer was about 22% lower than with the use of the chemical fertilizer.",1
"Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report at 2007, it is likely that there has been a substantial anthropogenic contribution to global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas and its increase is thought to give rise to the recent global warming. Although studies suggested the impact of population growth on carbon dioxide increase, much attention has not been paid. In this study population was plotted as compared to the atmospheric CO2 concentration. A quite linear relationship was observed between population and CO2 concentration at both before and after 1970, after which the global temperature rapidly increased. In addition, direct and indirect human-derived CO2 emission appeared to contribute much to the total amount of CO2 emission in developing countries and as the economy grow fossilfuel-derived CO2 emission increased more as compared to human-derived emission. These findings indicate that population growth especially in developing countries is a critical-factor for manipulation of global CO2 increase.",1
"This study aims to identify and discuss the main issues and uncertainties affecting electricity demand and supply in Brazil, and their consequent environmental burdens, over the period to the year 2020. It does so in the framework of two policy scenarios to test economic and environmental policy measures against a business as usual projection, which assumes energy policies existing in Brazil today remain in place and that no new major policies are adopted to reduce energy-related GHG emissions. It provides results from an analysis using a linear programming model that simulated scenarios through changes in emissions fees and caps, costs for technologies (including clean energy supplies) and demand side efficiency, to determine least-cost combinations of power supply technologies that meet projected power demand. Results show that electricity demand in Brazil will continue to grow vigorously over the next two decades, and that the institutional reforms under way in the domestic power sector have the potential to affect the future electric power technology choices to meet this rising demand. Also, the analysis suggests that, depending on how priorities are set, some conflict between local atmospheric pollution problems and global climate change issues may arise.

"The relationship, on a global basis, between the amount of N fixed by chemical, biological or atmospheric processes entering the terrestrial biosphere, and the total emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), has been re-examined, using known global atmospheric removal rates and concentration growth of N2O as a proxy for overall emissions. For both the pre-industrial period and in recent times, after taking into account the large-scale changes in synthetic N fertiliser production, we find an overall conversion factor of 3-5% from newly fixed N to N2O-N. We assume the same factor to be valid for biofuel production systems. It is covered only in part by the default conversion factor for ""direct"" emissions from agricultural crop lands (1%) estimated by IPCC (2006), and the default factors for the ""indirect"" emissions (following volatilization/deposition and leaching/runoff of N: 0.35-0.45%) cited therein. However, as we show in the paper, when additional emissions included in the IPCC methodology, e.g. those from livestock production, are included, the total may not be inconsistent with that given by our ""top-down"" method. When the extra N2O emission from biofuel production is calculated in ""CO2-equivalent"" global warming terms, and compared with the quasi-cooling effect of ""saving"" emissions of fossil fuel derived CO2, the outcome is that the production of commonly used biofuels, such as biodiesel from rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), depending on N fertilizer uptake efficiency by the plants, can contribute as much or more to global warming by N2O emissions than cooling by fossil fuel savings. Crops with less N demand, such as grasses and woody coppice species, have more favourable climate impacts. This analysis only considers the conversion of biomass to biofuel. It does not take into account the use of fossil fuel on the farms and for fertilizer and pesticide production, but it also neglects the production of useful co-products. Both factors partially compensate each other. This needs to be analyzed in a full life cycle assessment.",1
"The dependence on fossil fuels in developed countries is causing increasing concern. Global warming, issues related to peak oil, sustainability issues, and mounting concern for national energy security are the main drivers for a worldwide effort toward a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. The challenge is substantial, because fossil resources are such an integral part of our economy. However, there are many efforts to address this challenge. Development of conversion technologies fed by renewable resources is seen as a promising option. Many technologies for renewable energy are already well-developed and competitive in the market. Emerging technologies include biorefinery complexes, where biomass is used as a renewable carbon-based source for the production of bioenergy and biochemicals. The latter is perceived as a promising alternative to oil-based chemicals. Given the constraints on availability for renewable biomass supply, the importance of efficient use of biomass with a maximization of useful final products is well-acknowledged. Assessing the potentials for biochemicals can be achieved with an a priori estimation of the maximum theoretical yields, as well as a prediction of the conversion efficiencies (in terms of mass, carbon, and energy efficiency) of selected biorefinery production chains. This paper addresses this issue, providing a calculation procedure with which the theoretical yields and efficiencies of some biorefinery systems are estimated. Among the possible biomass sources, lignocellulosic biomass is selected as the raw material, because it is the most-widespread renewable source available in the world, it is locally available in many countries, and it does not compete with food and feed industries. The conversion of biomass to biofuels and chemicals requires conversion of the feedstock from a solid to a liquid state, but also the addition of hydrogen and rejection of excess oxygen, together with other undesired elements. The carbon contents of lignocellulosic biomass components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and products are calculated with the help of mathematical equations, and then the chemical reactions for the conversion of feedstock to products are modeled using matrix algebra: the maximum amount of biofuels and/or biochemicals from biomass and the maximum mass, energy, and carbon conversion efficiency of the biorefinery pathway are determined. Following this calculation procedure, an application to some biorefinery systems is performed and discussed. Combining the best feedstock with the most promising final products, results show that up to 0.33 kg of bioethanol, 0.06 kg of furfural, and 0.17 kg of FT-diesel per kg of softwood can be produced and mass, carbon, and energy conversion efficiencies of 56%, 70%, and 82%, respectively, are achieved.",1
"As one of the countermeasures against global warming, it is effective to make use of wood resources that serve as carbon storage and improve energy-saving efficiency of buildings. In this study, it is examined how the wall composition of a wooden house affects indoor thermal environments and its energy-saving effects. Three types of wooden wall panels with different compositions are used to examine each type's thermo-physical properties by JIS-compliant tests as well as large-scale tests with experimental buildings. Moreover, power consumption of a heated building was also measured in order to make clear the effect of the wall composition of a wooden house on energy-saving. The obtained results are as follows :  Coefficients of overall heat transmission were qualitatively larger in the following order : general mud wall>wall composed of wood and mud>wall primarily composed of heat insulating material. 2. The air-conditioner's power consumption was larger in the following order : house with A mud walls> house with walls composed of wood and mud>insulation-type house. As the temperature difference A between indoors and outdoors increased, this tendency became more notable. 3. In the cases of insulation-type 4 houses, the ratio of electric power consumption for heating to temperature difference between indoors and outdoors was generally constant, while in the case of a house with walls composed of wood and mud or with mud walls, the ratio was not constant, denoting the effect of heat capacity. 4. The compound wall of Japanese cedar and mud showed a better heat insulation property than the mud wall, and its energy-saving effect was improved.",1
"In recent years, global warming has been blamed on the so called ''greenhouse effect'' and has caught the attention of scientists and politicians throughout the world. There is an increasing concern surrounding the emission levels of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This paper is an extension of earlier work((1)) to show how cogeneration concepts can be used to reduce production costs by simultaneously producing electricity, CO2 and steam for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications.

Applications of the HTS coils are rapidly increasing since the Sumitomo's DI-BSCCO HTS wire has been developed and commercialized. This DI-BSCCO wire has almost the same mechanical properties as that of the copper wire while it can load a hundred times current. One of the applications of the HTS coils is the motor for the ship propulsion system. It reduces carbon dioxide emissions and contributes the anti-global warming action. Other application is the high-field magnets for the R&D activities. Fabrication of coils for these applications was carried out without difficulties thanks to its improved mechanical properties. The test results show the effectiveness of the DI-BSCCO wire.,1
"In this paper, the dynamic relationship between global surface temperature (global warming) and global carbon dioxide emission (CO2) is modelled and analyzed by causality and spectral analysis in the time domain and frequency domain, respectively. Historical data of global CO2 emission and global surface temperature anomalies over 129 years from 1860-1988 are used in this study. The causal relationship between the two phenomena is first examined using the Sim and Granger causality test in the time domain after the data series are filtered by ARIMA models. The Granger causal relationship is further scrutinized and confirmed by cross-spectral and multichannel spectral analysis in the frequency domain. The evidence found from both analyses proves that there is a positive causal relationship between the two variables. The time domain analysis suggests that Granger causality exists between global surface temperature and global CO2 emission. Further, CO2 emission causes the change in temperature. The conclusions are further confirmed by the frequency domain analysis, which indicates that the increase in CO2 emission causes climate warming because a high coherence exists between the two variables. Furthermore, it is proved that climate changes happen after an increase in CO2 emission, which confirms that the increase in CO2 emission does cause global warming.

"A coupled chemistry climate model, the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model was used to perform a transient climate simulation to quantify the impact of geoengineered aerosols on atmospheric processes. In contrast to previous model studies, the impact on stratospheric chemistry, including heterogeneous chemistry in the polar regions, is considered in this simulation. In the geoengineering simulation, a constant stratospheric distribution of volcanic-sized, liquid sulfate aerosols is imposed in the period 2020-2050, corresponding to an injection of 2 Tg S/a. The aerosol cools the troposphere compared to a baseline simulation. Assuming an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B emission scenario, global warming is delayed by about 40 years in the troposphere with respect to the baseline scenario. Large local changes of precipitation and temperatures may occur as a result of geoengineering. Comparison with simulations carried out with the Community Atmosphere Model indicates the importance of stratospheric processes for estimating the impact of stratospheric aerosols on the Earth's climate. Changes in stratospheric dynamics and chemistry, especially faster heterogeneous reactions, reduce the recovery of the ozone layer in middle and high latitudes for the Southern Hemisphere. In the geoengineering case, the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole is delayed by about 30 years on the basis of this model simulation. For the Northern Hemisphere, a onefold to twofold increase of the chemical ozone depletion occurs owing to a simulated stronger polar vortex and colder temperatures compared to the baseline simulation, in agreement with observational estimates.",1
"Control of CO(2) emissions, which are the main factor causing global warming, is one of the most important problems in the 21st century for the preservation of the earth's environment. Therefore, efficient supply and use of energy are indispensable. We have proposed distributed energy management systems (DEMS), which are intended to obtain optimal plans that minimize both costs and CO(2) emissions by electrical and thermal trading. In this paper we evaluate trading methods for the DEMS through computational experiments. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless gas that exists at a concentration of approximately 330 ppm in the atmosphere and is released in great quantities when fossil fuels are burned. The current flux of carbon out of fossil fuels is about 600 times greater than that into fossil fuels. With increased concerns about global warming and greenhouse gas emissions, there have been several approaches proposed for managing the levels Of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. One of the most understudied methods for CO2 Mitigation is the use of biological processes in engineered systems such as photobioreactors. This research project describes the effectiveness of Chlorella vulgaris, used in a photobioreactor with a very short gas residence time, in sequestering CO2 from an elevated CO2 airstream. We evaluated a flow-through photobioreactor's operational parameters, as well as the growth characteristics of the C. vulgaris inoculum when exposed to an airstream with over 1850 ppm CO2. When using dry weight, chlorophyll, and direct microscopic measurements, it was apparent that the photobioreactor's algal inoculum responded well to the elevated CO2 levels and there was no build-up of CO2 or carbonic acid in the photobioreactor. The photobioreactor, with a gas residence time of approximately 2 s, was able to remove up to 74% of the CO2 in the airstream to ambient levels. This corresponded to a 63.9-g/m(3)/h bulk removal for the experimental photobioreactor. Consequently, this photobioreactor shows that biological processes may have some promise for treating point source emissions Of CO2 and deserve further study.",1
"One way of mitigating global climate change is protecting and enhancing biosphere carbon stocks. The success of mitigation initiatives depends on the long-term net balance between carbon gains and losses. The biodiversity of ecological communities, including composition and variability of traits of plants and soil organisms, can alter this balance in several ways. This influence can be direct, through determining the magnitude, turnover rate, and longevity of carbon stocks in soil and vegetation. It can also be indirect through influencing the value and therefore the protection that societies give to ecosystems and their carbon stocks. Biodiversity of forested ecosystems has important consequences for long-term carbon storage, and thus warrants incorporation into the design, implementation, and regulatory framework of mitigation initiatives.",1
"Several cases of extreme local weather conditions since the storms of October 1987 have served as reminders of some of the possible consequences of global warming, recently more usually, although less precisely, referred to as 'climate change'. Carbon dioxide emissions have been identified as the principal likely culprit and road traffic is the only major source from the UK which is increasing in amount. Local authorities may feel impotent to make a significant contribution to a solution, but example is a worthwhile motive. A local authority can contribute in several ways: implementation of improved vehicle technologies; adopting road speed limits and upholding them; promotion of driving styles which are more sensitive to their environmental effects and of improved vehicle maintenance; policies to change mode of travel and transport and to reduce the amount of travel by several means, including fuller use of vehicles. Many of the ways of reducing carbon dioxide discharges locally will have other environmental benefits. The implementation of cleaner travel lags behind the science to allow it; local authorities have an important role to play in reducing the gap. Average vehicle loadings are low, especially for personal travel; there is much scope for improved environmental performance, and for public transport there are issues relating to value for public spending. Reductions in the amount of travel can also contribute to several government policies relating to social exclusion, promotion of sustainable communities and supporting town centre activities.",1
"A combination of reconstructed histories, long-term time series and recent quasi-continuous observations of non-CO2 greenhouse gases at the high-Alpine site Jungfraujoch is used to assess their current global radiative forcing budget and the influence of regulations due to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in terms of climate change. Extrapolated atmospheric greenhouse gases trends from 1989 assuming a business-as-usualscenario, i.e. no Montreal Protocol restriction, are presented and compared to the observations. The largest differences between hypothetical business-as-usual mixing ratios and current atmospheric observations over the last 16 years were found for chlorinated species, in particular methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) at 167 to 203 ppt and chlorofluorocarbon-12 (CFC-12) at 121 to 254 ppt. These prevented increases were used to estimate the effects of their restrictions on the radiative forcing budget. The net direct effect due to the Montreal Protocol regulations reduces global warming and offsets about 14 to 30% of the positive greenhouse effect related to the major greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O and also SF6, and about 12 to 22% of the hypothetical current radiative forcing increase without Montreal Protocol restrictions. Thus, the Montreal Protocol succeeded not only in reducing the atmospheric chlorine content in the atmosphere but also dampened global warming. Nevertheless, the Montreal Protocol controlled species still add to global warming. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
This article introduces a new conceptual design tool for an environmentally sustainable method of aeropropulsion: a ducted fan system driven by a fully superconducting electrical machine. Such a system could help mitigate aviation's contribution to global climate change by enabling the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. An electro-thermal motor sizing model was coupled with cycle analysis and weight estimation routines to create an automated environment for rapid design trade studies. The resulting parametric cycle analysis and sizing outcomes revealed the system's operational boundaries for a given aspiration space.,1
"Background, Aim and Scope. The Home Appliance Recycling Law (hereunder referred to as the Law) for used cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs, air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines was enacted in April 2001 in Japan. The Law requires that retailers reclaim, and manufacturers and importers recycle such home appliances. Consumers are required to pay collection and recycling fees incurred in disposing of any of the four home appliances. Home appliances must, as a general rule, be managed in accordance with the Law. In reality, other routes exist, such as via local authorities, scrap processors, illegal dumping and exporting. At about the time the Law was enacted, the refrigerant used for air conditioners and refrigerators was replaced by more environmentally friendly substances such as isobutene. Local authorities had the responsibility of disposing of the appliances of households before the enactment of the Law. It was general practice for local authorities to dispose of home appliances in landfills after breaking them up and recovering valuable resources such as iron, copper and aluminum. Although they made efforts to recover refrigerant fluorocarbons, there were not required to do so. Materials and Methods. This study analyzed the material flow resulting from the Law and other processing flows to quantify the global warming effect caused by home appliance recycling using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. To evaluate the Law and to develop policy planning, the challenges of future efforts will be considered using time series data. For these reasons, we have assessed the Project Scenario, which corresponded to the present reality; the Baseline Scenario, which assumed that measures such as the Law were not implemented after 2000, and the Ideal Scenario, where all used products were recycled as prescribed by the Law. The environmental impacts for each scenario were estimated using value, which was obtained from multiplying the amount of reproduction and waste treatment by each inventory data. Results. It is estimated that emission reductions of 4.7E+4 t CO(2)e, subtracted the Project Scenario from the Baseline Scenario, were reduced for TVs in 2001 through recycling. The impact from recycling glass from cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions is significant. An improvement of 2.3E+4 t CO(2)e could be anticipated by upgrading to the Ideal Scenario in 200 It was estimated that there was a reduction of 9.2E+5 t CO(2)e in 2001 for air conditioners. Although the effect of the recovery for refrigerants contributed greatly, some fluorocarbons that are still discharged have had a considerable impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Hypothetically, a reduction of 3.2E+6 t CO(2)e could be anticipated with the Ideal Scenario in 200 A reduction of 2.6E+6 t CO(2)e was achieved for refrigerators in 200 Although a further reduction can be anticipated through the Ideal Scenario, there will not be much difference with the Project Scenario by 2010. It was estimated that 3.8E+4 t CO(2)e were reduced for washing machines in 200 Only a small improvement can be expected through the Ideal Scenario. Discussion. Since many assumptions were used in this study, a sensitivity analysis was carried out in order to grasp their impact. The findings of the sensitivity analysis are that the uncertainties are large, but the number of the greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions is still clear except for the difference between the Project Scenario and the Ideal Scenario for TVs. This analysis gives authenticity to the findings. Conclusions. Establishing a system for liquid crystal display and plasma display panel TVs is desirable because the absolute amount of used LCD/PDP TVs will rapidly increase as the usage of CRT TVs rapidly decreases from 2007. With regard to refrigerant recovery from air conditioners, a significant decrease in GHG emissions has been recorded. There is, however, still ample room for improvement. It will be necessary to switch to refrigerants with low global warming potentials (GWPs) or work more on improving the recovery rate in the future. Alternatives and recovery of fluorocarbons from refrigerators contributed greatly to GHG reductions. The GHG emissions from refrigerator recycling will be minimal whether used refrigerator will be processed legally or not because most used refrigerators will contain natural refrigerants in the near future. The improvement for washing machines was low because it was assumed that their main constituent steel has been previously recycled, and that the plastic recycling rate will not change significantly in the future. An improvement in the recycling technology itself is required. This study was carried out on four home appliance products, and it was found that the Home Appliance Recycling Law has brought significant reductions in GHG emissions. There is also room to make GHG reductions through improving the processing methods further. Recommendations and Perspectives. The impact on GHG emissions by fluorocarbons of air conditioners and refrigerators is the greatest. Adequate measures are particularly required for air conditioners that may continue to discharge GHGs in the future.",1
High-resolution (0.03 cm(-1)) absolute infrared photoabsorption cross sections of bromotrifluoromethane (CF3Br) and tetralluoroethylene (C2F4) have been measured using Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy at temperatures between 213 and 296 K. The measured cross sections were subsequently used to estimate the radiative forcings and the global warming potentials of these two species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,1
"The Colorado River supplies water to 27 million users in 7 states and 2 countries and irrigates over 3 million acres of farmland. Global climate models almost unanimously project that human-induced climate change will reduce runoff in this region by 10-30%. This work explores whether currently scheduled future water deliveries from the Colorado River system are sustainable under different climate-change scenarios. If climate change reduces runoff by 10%, scheduled deliveries will be missed approximate to 58% of the time by 2050. If runoff reduces 20%, they will be missed approximate to 88% of the time. The mean shortfall when full deliveries cannot be met increases from approximate to 0.5-0.7 billion cubic meters per year (bcm/yr) in 2025 to approximate to 2-9 bcm/yr by 2050 out of a request of approximate to 17.3 bcm/yr. Such values are small enough to be manageable. The chance of a year with deliveries <14.5 bcm/yr increases to 21% by midcentury if runoff reduces 20%, but such low deliveries could be largely avoided by reducing scheduled deliveries. These results are computed by using estimates of Colorado River flow from the 20th century, which was unusually wet; if the river reverts to its long-term mean, shortfalls increase another 1-5 bcm/yr. With either climate-change or long-term mean flows, currently scheduled future water deliveries from the Colorado River are not sustainable. However, the ability of the system to mitigate droughts can be maintained if the various users of the river find a way to reduce average deliveries.",1
"It has been pointed out in recent years that the potential impacts of global warming has been becoming more and more serious because of the rapid increase of anthropogenic CO2 emission. Japan's annual CO2 emissions (fiscal 1994) amounted to 343 million tons of carbon. Although CO2 emissions caused by fossil-fuel power generation accounted for 29.4% of total, on a sector basis, those directly from the energy conversion sector accounted for only 7.7%, Most CO2 emissions (27% of total) resulted from electric power use in the industrial, commercial and domestic sectors. Thus, the reduction of CO2 emissions caused by the use of electricity is a nationwide subject, Understanding that both supply side and demand side approaches are necessary, Kansai Electric has been deploying ""New ERA Strategy"" as a comprehensive strategy to seek a potential for CO2 reduction mole broadly and deeply. Among a number of action items are the promotion of nuclear power generation, and improvement of overall energy efficiency besides such demand side measures as leveling off the peak load. The effectiveness of action items of the New ERA Strategy was evaluated in terms of CO2 reduction. As a result, estimated CO2 reduction related to nuclear power amounted to 88% of the total for fiscal 1995 in comparison with 1990, and that expected in 2000 is 84%, These results reconfirm that nuclear power is always the key to practical CO2 reduction at present and in the future. Comparison with candidate technology alternatives revealed that photovoltaic power generation needed 7 times greater rated capacity and 280 times larger area than nuclear power, so it is not realistic as a central power station alternative. The comparison also clarified that if wind power stations were constructed at all feasible sites in the Kansai region, they would not be a viable alternative to a single nuclear unit from CO2 duction viewpoint.

"A rapid increase in greenhouse gas levels is thought to have fueled global warming at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Foraminiferal magnesium/calcium ratios indicate that bottom waters warmed by 4 degrees to 5 degrees C, similar to tropical and subtropical surface ocean waters, implying no amplification of warming in high-latitude regions of deep-water formation under ice-free conditions. Intermediate waters warmed before the carbon isotope excursion, in association with downwelling in the North Pacific and reduced Southern Ocean convection, supporting changing circulation as the trigger for methane hydrate release. A switch to deep convection in the North Pacific at the PETM onset could have amplified and sustained warming.",1
"Methane and nitrous oxide are both potent greenhouse gasses, with global warming potentials approximately 25 and 298 times that of carbon dioxide. A matrix of soil microcosms was constructed with landfill cover soils collected from the King Highway Landfill in Kalamazoo, Michigan and exposed to geochemical parameters known to affect methane consumption by methanotrophs while also examining their impact on biogenic nitrous oxide production. It was found that relatively dry soils (5% moisture content) along with 15 mg NH (4) (+) (kg soil)(-1) and 0.1 mg phenylacetylenea (TM)(kg soil)(-1) provided the greatest stimulation of methane oxidation while minimizing nitrous oxide production. Microarray analyses of pmoA showed that the methanotrophic community structure was dominated by Type II organisms, but Type I genera were more evident with the addition of ammonia. When phenylacetylene was added in conjunction with ammonia, the methanotrophic community structure was more similar to that observed in the presence of no amendments. PCR analyses showed the presence of amoA from both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, and that the presence of key genes associated with these cells was reduced with the addition of phenylacetylene. Messenger RNA analyses found transcripts of pmoA, but not of mmoX, nirK, norB, or amoA from either ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or archaea. Pure culture analyses showed that methanotrophs could produce significant amounts of nitrous oxide, particularly when expressing the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). Collectively, these data suggest that methanotrophs expressing pMMO played a role in nitrous oxide production in these microcosms.",1
"Cloud simulations and cloud-climate feedbacks in the tropical and subtropical eastern Pacific region in 16 state-of-the-art coupled global climate models (GCMs) and in the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) Regional Atmospheric Model (iRAM) are examined. The authors find that the simulation of the present-day mean cloud climatology for this region in the GCMs is very poor and that the cloud-climate feedbacks vary widely among the GCMs. By contrast, iRAM simulates mean clouds and interannual cloud variations that are quite similar to those observed in this region. The model also simulates well the observed relationship between lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and low-level cloud amount. To investigate cloud-climate feedbacks in iRAM, several global warming scenarios were run with boundary conditions appropriate for late twenty-first-century conditions. All the global warming cases simulated with iRAM show a distinct reduction in low-level cloud amount, particularly in the stratocumulus regime, resulting in positive local feedback parameters in these regions in the range of 4-7 W m(-2) K- Domain-averaged (30 degrees S-30 degrees N, 150 degrees-60 degrees W) feedback parameters from iRAM range between +8 and +9 W m(-2) K- At most locations both the LTS and cloud amount are altered in the global warming cases, but the changes in these variables do not follow the empirical relationship found in the present-day experiments. The cloud-climate feedback averaged over the same east Pacific region was also calculated from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B simulations for each of the 16 GCMs with results that varied from -0 to +3 W m(-2) K-1, all less than the values obtained in the comparable iRAM simulations. The iRAM results by themselves cannot be connected definitively to global climate feedbacks; however, among the global GCMs the cloud feedback in the full tropical-subtropical zone is correlated strongly with the east Pacific cloud feedback, and the cloud feedback largely determines the global climate sensitivity. The present iRAM results for cloud feedbacks in the east Pacific provide some support for the high end of current estimates of global climate sensitivity.",1
"We compare calculated greenhouse gas emissions for a North American beef feedlot operation, which includes biogas production by anaerobic digestion with subsequent electricity generation (the AD case), to the emissions for a ""business as usual"" case, which includes both a feedlot and an equivalent amount of grid-generated electricity. Anaerobic digestion, biogas production and electricity production are the major sources of differences in emissions. Fertilizer production, crop production, manure collection and spreading, as well as the associated transport stages are also considered within the LCA system boundaries; impacts on life cycle emissions from these sources are lower. Running a feedlot and producing electricity using typical grid power plants produces 3,845 kg CO2-eq/MWh while running a feedlot, which generates biogas to produce electricity, produces 2,965 kg CO2-eq/MWh. This savings of 880 kg CO2-eq/MWh arises because the net power generation in the AD case emits about 90% less life cycle GHG emissions compared to grid-average electricity. The high overall emission levels arise due to emissions associated with enteric fermentation in beef cattle as the main source of GHG emissions in both the ""business as usual"" and the AD cases. It contributed 57% of total emissions for the feedlot /biogas /electricity system and 44% of total emissions for the feedlot /grid electricity system.",1
"This paper presents a summary of a local effort in California to assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and identify potential mitigation measures. Local policymakers in California already have been searching for ways to reduce GHG emissions but it was the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), which seeks to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. that has provided a framework for regions to evaluate their ability to reduce GHG emissions. We conducted a GHG inventory for the San Diego region from 1990 to 2006, with forecasts to 2020. The region emitted approximately 34 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMT CO(2)E) in 2006 from anthropogenic sources, which represents a 17% increase over the 1990 level of 29 MMT CO(2)E. Applying a combination of 21 existing or pending state GHG reduction mandates and feasible regional measures we show that the region could achieve the AB 32 target. Although the largest reductions are achieved through state mandates, all measures, including at the local level, will be required to achieve the AB 32 target. Thus local regions retain control over a fairly significant portion of reductions, and remain important actors in the implementation and compliance of state mandates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Abatement of particulate matter has traditionally been driven by health concerns rather than its role in global warming. Here we assess future abatement strategies in terms of how much they reduce the climate impact of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) from contained combustion. We develop global scenarios which take into account regional differences in climate impact, costs of abatement and ability to pay, as well as both the direct and indirect (snow-albedo) climate impact of BC and OC. To represent the climate impact, we estimate consistent region-specific values of direct and indirect global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential (GTP). The indirect GWP has been estimated using a physical approach and includes the effect of change in albedo from BC deposited on snow. The indirect GWP is highest in the Middle East followed by Russia, Europe and North America, while the total GWP is highest in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. We conclude that prioritizing emission reductions in Asia represents the most cost-efficient global abatement strategy for BC because Asia is (1) responsible for a large share of total emissions, (2) has lower abatement costs compared to Europe and North America and (3) has large health cobenefits from reduced PM10 emissions.",1
"Palaeoecologists have shown that toes migrated at rates of 100 - 1000 m/yr in response to post-glacial warming, In order to predict the impact of forecast anthropogenic climate changes upon forest ecosystems we need to simulate how trees may migrate in response to the changes predicted for the next 1 - 2 centuries. These predictions must rake account of the impacts upon migration of human land-use and habitat fragmentation. We have developed a spatially-explicit mechanistic model (MIGRATE) able to simulate the migration of a single species across a realistically heterogeneous landscape. MIGRATE uses biological parameters that readily may be estimated from data in the literature or from field studies, and represents the landscape as a grid of cells, each with an associated carrying capacity. A one-dimensional version of MIGRATE has been compared both with Skellam's (1951) diffusion model and with the more recent analytical models of van den Bosch et al. (1990, 1992); despite its fundamentally different approach, MIGRATE provides comparable estimates of migration rates, given equivalent input parameters. An example is described that demonstrates the ability of the two-dimensional version of MIGRATE to simulate the likely pattern of spread of a species across a heterogeneous landscape. It is argued that MIGRATE, or models like it, will play a central role in a spatially-hierarchic modelling strategy that must be developed if we are to achieve the goal of simulating the likely response of trees, and other organisms, to both global climate change and the increasing pressures of human land-use.",1
"In this work, we analyze the two-dimensional distribution of mean and intermodel spread of Arctic sea ice and climate change at the time of CO2 doubling and their connection using the simulations from the second phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2). Arctic surface warming at the time of CO2 doubling is found to be not evenly distributed and ranges from 1degrees to 5degreesC. The intermodel spread is pronounced in the Arctic Ocean, particularly in the Barents Sea. Reduction of sea-ice thickness (SIT) is in the range 0.3-8 m and mainly appears in the Greenland-Barents Seas. Meanwhile, sea-ice concentrations (SIC) decrease more than 10% in most regions of the Arctic Ocean. The sensitivity of Arctic surface air temperature change with respect to sea-ice area change is model-dependent. For some models, the sensitivity is different even in different periods of the transient integration. Values of the sensitivity vary from -2.0 to -0.5degreesC/10(6) km(2) for most CMIP2 models. A colder (warmer) Arctic climate may favor a higher (lower) sensitivity. The simulated mean and intermodel spread patterns of surface air temperature (SAT) change are similar to those of SIT and sea level pressure (SLP) changes. This implies that the mean and intermodel spread of projected Arctic climate change are influenced by the interaction between sea ice and the atmosphere. Both SIT and SIC are sensitive to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, and are connected with SAT and SLP changes in the Arctic. The average of all model simulations indicates that the north-south SLP gradient and the mean westerly winds are enhanced by CO2 doubling. Finally, both the mean and intermodel spread patterns show considerable differences between models with and without flux adjustment in some regions.",1
"Climate change in the European Alps during the 20th century has been characterized by increases in minimum temperatures of about 2 degrees C, a more modest increase in maximum temperatures, little trend in precipitation data, and a general decrease of sunshine duration through to the mid-1980s. Temperature increase has been most intense in the 1940s, followed by the 1980s. The warming experienced since the early 1980s, while synchronous with the global warming, is of far greater amplitude and reaches close to 1 degrees C for this ensemble average and up to 2 degrees C for individual sites. Such changes caused pronounced effects in the glacial and periglacial belts. Since the middle of the past century-the end of the Little Ice Age-the glacierization of the European Alps has lost about 30 to 40% in surface area and around half its original volume. The estimated total glacier volume in the European Alps was some 130 km(3) for the mid-1970s, but strongly negative mass balances have caused an additional loss of about 10 to 20% of this remaining ice volume since 1980. Periglacial permafrost in the Alps today occupies an area comparable to the glacierized area and must have been affected as well, but its secular evolution is much less well known. Simulations of high-resolution climatologies for double-CO(2) situations using regional climate models (RCM) with a 20-km horizontal grid give generally higher winter temperatures, a more marked increase in summer temperatures, indications that temperature increases more at higher elevations than at lower altitudes, and higher/ more intense precipitation in winter, but much dryer conditions in summer. Under such conditions, the Alps would lose major parts of their glacier cover within decades, warming of cold firn areas at high altitudes could become pronounced and lower limits of permafrost occurrence in the Alps could rise by several hundred meters. Pronounced disequilibria could result, in the water cycle, in mass wasting processes, and in sediment flux as well as in growth conditions of vegetation. For those directly involved with such changes, the main challenge would be to adapt to high and accelerating rates of environment evolution. Empirical knowledge would have to be replaced increasingly by improved process understanding, especially concerning runoff formation and slope stability. In view of the uncertainties involved with future projections, highest priority should be given to appropriate monitoring programs.",1
"Nitrous oxide is produced from denitrification and nitrification processes in soils, and contributes to global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. Laboratory experiments with six soils ranging in clay content between 4-12% were designed to investigate the effect of water and temperature on the partitioning of N2O from denitrification and nitrification. The nitrification rates at 70% field capacity (FC) were significantly higher in the loamy soils (980-1440 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1)) than in the sandy soils (60-460 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1) ). The nitrous oxide produced by nitrification differed similarly between the soil types resulting in ratios of N2O-N relative to NO3--N, which were only ranging from 0.28 to 0.48% with an average of 0.39%, indicating a rather constant relationship between nitrifrcation and nitrous oxide emission. Maximum nitrification rates occured at 20 degrees C and 100% fired capacity (FC) and was 1/3 at 40% FC. At lower temperatures only small responses to changes in soil moisture were observed. The percentage of N2O-N produced by nitrification increased with increasing soil moisture (0.49% at 40% FC and 0.93% at 100% FC) and decreased with increasing temperature (0.49% at 5 degrees C and 0.17% at 20 degrees C). The denitrification activity (N-2 + N2O) in the sandy loam soil responded significantly to both increased soil moisture and increased temperature, whereas the coarse sandy soil only reacted to increased temperature. In the coarse sandy soil the Q(10)-values were in the range from 9 to 3.4, and the values were ranging from 4.9 to 8.9 in the sandy loam soil. As for the denitrification activity also the N-2 to N2O ratio increased exponentially with increasing temperature, which implies a linear relationship between the Iog(N-2 to N2O ratio) and the temperature. The N-2 to N2O ratios were lower in the coarse sandy soil than in the sandy loam soil, and were in the range from 0 to 16.",1
"The relative costs and CO, emission reduction benefits of advanced centralized fossil fuel electricity generation, hybrid photovoltaic-fossil fuel electricity generation, and total solar electricity generation with hydrogen storage are compared. Component costs appropriate to the year 2000-2010 time frame are assumed throughout. For low insolation conditions (160 W m mean annual solar radiation), photovoltaic electricity could cost 5-13 cents kWh(-1) by year 2000-2010, while for high insolation conditions (260 W m(-2)) the cost could be 4-9 cents kWh(-2) Advanced fossil fuel-based power generation should achieve efficiencies of 50% using coal and 55% using natural gas. Carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by a factor of two to three compared to conventional coal-based electricity production in industralized countries. Ln a solar-fossil fuel hybrid, some electricity would be supplied from solar energy whenever the sun is shining and remaining demand satisfied by fossil fuels. This increases total capital costs but saves on fuel costs. For low insolation conditions, the cost of electricity increases by 0-2 cents kWh(-1), while the cost of electricity decreases in many cases for high insolation conditions. Solar energy would provide 20% or 30% of electricity demand for the low and high insolation cases, respectively. In the solar-hydrogen energy system, some photovoltaic arrays would provide current electricity demand while others would be used to produce hydrogen electrolytically for storage and later use in fuel cells to generate electricity. Electricity costs from the solar-hydrogen system are 0.2-5.4 cents kWh(-1) greater than from a natural gas power plant, and 0-4.5 cents kWh(-1) greater than from coal plant for the cost and performance assumptions;adopted here. The carbon tax required to make the solar-hydrogen system competitive with fossil fuels ranges from $70-660 tonne(-1), depending on the cost and performance of system components and the future price of fossil fuels. Leakage of hydrogen from storage into the atmosphere, and the eventual transport of a portion of the leaked hydrogen to the stratosphere, would result in the formation of stratospheric water vapor. This could perturb stratospheric ozone amounts and contribute to global warming. Order-of-magnitude calculations indicate that, for a leakage rate of 0.5% y(-1) of total hydrogen production - which might be characteristic of underground hydrogen storage - the global warming effect of solar-hydrogen electricity generation is on the order of 1% the impact of the hybrid system. Impacts on stratospheric ozone are likely to be minuscule. Copyright (C) 1996 International Association for Hydrogen Energy",1
"Switzerland's economy depends heavily on tourism. For many alpine areas in the country, winter tourism is the most important source of income, and snow-reliability is one of the key elements of the offers made by tourism in the Alps. The financial viability of winter tourism, however, depends on sufficient snow conditions. The lack of snow at the end of the 1980s left a lasting imprint on the tourism industry. If the assumptions of the impacts of climate change hold true, snow cover in the Swiss Alps will diminish, and this will, in turn, jeopardise the tourism industry. 85% of Switzerland's current ski resorts can be designated as snow-reliable. If climate change occurs, the level of snow-reliability will rise from 1200 m up to 1800 m over the next few decades. Only 44% of the ski resorts would then still be snow-reliable. While some regions may be able to maintain their winter tourism with suitable adaptation strategies, others would lose all winter tourism due to a diminishing snow pack. Despite global warming, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of winters with heavy snowfall in the future (e.g. the winter of 1998/99, particularly February 1999). Climate change must be viewed as a catalyst that is reinforcing and accelerating the pace of structural changes in tourism. Today, adaptation strategies are predominant in tourism (e.g. artificial snow production). As an industry that will be severely affected by climate change, however, tourism will increasingly have to focus on mitigation strategies (e.g. less greenhouse gas emissions by tourism traffic).",1
"In this work, a combination of two hydrofluorocarbon compounds, pentafluoroethane (FC-125, C2HF5) and 1,1-difluoroethane (FC-152a, CF2H-CH3), was evaluated as a potential replacement for perfluorocompounds in dielectric etch applications. A high aspect ratio oxide via etch was used as the test vehicle for this study, which was conducted in a commercial inductively coupled high density plasma etch tool. Both process and emissions data were collected and compared to those provided by a process utilizing a standard perfluorinated etch chemistry (C2F6). Global warming (CF4, C2F6, CHF3) and hygroscopic gas (HF, SiF4) emissions were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FC-125/FC-152a was found to produce significant reductions in global warming emissions, on the order of 68 to 76% relative to the reference process. Although etch stopping, caused by a high degree of polymer deposition inside the etched features, was observed, process data otherwise appeared promising for an initial study, with good resist selectivity and etch rates being achieved.",1
"Waste prevention has been addressed in the literature in terms of the social and behavioural aspects, but very little quantitative assessment exists of the environmental benefits. Our study evaluates the environmental consequences of waste prevention on waste management systems and on the wider society, using life-cycle thinking. The partial prevention of unsolicited mail, beverage packaging and food waste is tested for a ""High-tech"" waste management system relying on high energy and material recovery and for a ""Low-tech"" waste management system with less recycling and relying on landfilling. Prevention of 13% of the waste mass entering the waste management system generates a reduction of loads and savings in the waste management system for the different impacts categories; 45% net reduction for nutrient enrichment and 12% reduction for global warming potential. When expanding our system and including avoided production incurred by the prevention measures, large savings are observed (15-fold improvement for nutrient enrichment and 2-fold for global warming potential). Prevention of food waste has the highest environmental impact saving. Prevention generates relatively higher overall relative benefit for ""Low-tech"" systems depending on landfilling. The paper provides clear evidence of the environmental benefits of waste prevention and has specific relevance in climate change mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Energy production from two types of municipal solid waste was evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA): (1) mixed high calorific waste suitable for production of solid recovered fuels (SRF) and (2) source separated organic waste. For SRF, co-combustion was compared with mass burn incineration. For organic waste, anaerobic digestion (AD) was compared with mass burn incineration. In the case of mass burn incineration, incineration with and without energy recovery was modelled. Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion was evaluated for use both as transportation fuel and for heat and power production. All relevant consequences for energy and resource consumptions, emissions to air, water and soil, upstream processes and downstream processes were included in the LCA. Energy substitutions were considered with respect to two different energy systems: a present-day Danish system based on fossil fuels and a potential future system based on 100% renewable energy. It was found that mass burn incineration of SRF with energy recovery provided savings in all impact categories, but co-combustion was better with respect to Global Warming (GW). If all heat from incineration could be utilized, however, the two alternatives were comparable for SRF. For organic waste, mass burn incineration with energy recovery was preferable over anaerobic digestion in most impact categories. Waste composition and flue gas cleaning at co-combustion plants were critical for the environmental performance of SRF treatment, while the impacts related to utilization of the digestate were significant for the outcome of organic waste treatment. The conclusions were robust in a present-day as well as in a future energy system. This indicated that mass burn incineration with efficient energy recovery is a very environmentally competitive solution overall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
" Long-term variability in sea surface temperature (SST) in the equatorial Pacific and its relationship with global warming were investigated using three SST data sets (Hadley Center Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature, extended reconstruction sea surface temperature, and Kaplan), atmospheric fields from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis, and subsurface sea temperature from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation data set. A cooling mode in the equatorial Pacific cold tongue is evident in all three SST data sets for two periods: 1870-2007 and 1948-2007. This cooling, which is indicated by the second empirical orthogonal function mode, is characterized by cooling in the Pacific cold tongue and warming elsewhere in the tropical Pacific. Its principal component time series is highly correlated with global mean surface temperature combining air temperature and SST. In association with the SST cooling mode, atmospheric fields and subsurface sea temperature are coupled in the tropical Pacific during recent decades. Moreover, for the coupled models in the 20th century run (20C3M), obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report database, those with realistic features of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events can well show the cooling mode. However, the cooling mode is not shown in these coupled models in a preindustrial scenario with no forcing attributed to global warming. Results from observations and models suggest that the cooling mode is very likely caused by global warming. This conclusion is supported by a hypothesis that considers dynamic effects in the equatorial Pacific Ocean in response to global warming.",1
"If it were to become apparent that dangerous changes in global climate were inevitable, despite greenhouse gas controls, active methods to cool the Earth on an emergency basis might be desirable. The concept considered here is to block 8% of the solar flux with a space sunshade orbited near the inner Lagrange point (L1), in-line between the Earth and sun. Following the work of J. Early [Early, A (1989) J Br Interplanet Soc 42:567-569], transparent material would be used to deflect the sunlight, rather than to absorb it, to minimize the shift in balance out from L1 caused by radiation pressure. Three advances aimed at practical implementation are presented. First is an optical design for a very thin refractive screen with low reflectivity, leading to a total sunshade mass of approximate to 20 million tons. Second is a concept aimed at reducing transportation cost to $50/kg by using electromagnetic acceleration to escape Earth's gravity, followed by ion propulsion. Third is an implementation of the sunshade as a cloud of many spacecraft, autonomously stabilized by modulating solar radiation pressure. These meter-sized ""flyers"" would be assembled completely before launch, avoiding any need for construction or unfolding in space. They would weigh a gram each, be launched in stacks of 800,000, and remain for a projected lifetime of 50 years within a 100,000km-long cloud. The concept builds on existing technologies. It seems feasible that it could be developed and deployed in approximate to 25 years at a cost of a few trillion dollars, < 0.5% of world gross domestic product (GDP) over that time.",1
"We have calculated from a 2degrees x 2degrees grid of oceanic properties the contribution of oceanic loss to the overall lifetimes of a number of anthropogenic and naturally produced trace gases involved in global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. The model, originally developed for atmospheric methyl bromide, can be used for any well-mixed trace gas where the seawater degradation rate constants and solubilities are known. Of the gases tested, it is clear that known oceanic chemical degradation processes alone are not significant sinks for most HFCs and HCFCs. Chemical degradation in the oceans is a substantial sink for COS (28%) and COCl2 (8%) and a minor sink for CH3Cl (<2%) and CH3I (2.5%), and it should be considered when determining atmospheric lifetimes and sink strengths for these gases. Biological degradation processes are likely to increase the oceanic uptake rates of many gases.",1
"The concentration of atmospheric methane (CH(4)) exerts a strong influence on atmospheric chemistry and the global climate. Natural and cultivated wetlands (rice paddies) are important sources of CH(4), and the extent and strength of these sources may increase as a result of global warming and extension of rice production. Emission of methane From wetlands is an ecosystem process, closely coupled to local climatic and soil environments which influence complex processes of plant growth, soil organic matter decomposition, methanogenesis and CH(4) oxidation. Rates of emission show large variation in both space and time and their estimation from point measurements or from correlation with net primary production is difficult and unreliable. Here we report a study in which process-based ecosystem models were used to estimate global CH(4) emissions from natural wetlands and rice paddies, and the sensitivity of the models to simple climate change scenarios were tested. Our estimate of global emission was 145 Tg yr(-1), of which 92 Tg yr(-1) came from natural wetlands and 53 Tg yr(-1) from rice paddies. The emissions from wetlands at high-latitude and rice paddies were only half of those reported in the traditional literature, confirming more recent measurements. The models also showed thar modest global warming may produce a higher CH(4) emission, but that this effect may be reversed by larger increases in temperature, due to the effect of soil moisture depletion.

"Natural ventilation is a proven strategy for maintaining thermal comfort in non-domestic buildings in the UK. The energy consumption and thus the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming are lower than in conventional air-conditioned buildings. However, the ambient temperatures in the UK have risen over the last decade and new climatic data for use in the design of naturally ventilated buildings has been published. Using these data and dynamic thermal modelling, it is shown that passive stack ventilation alone was unlikely to maintain summertime comfort in a proposed University College London building within an urban heat island. The stack ventilation strategy was evolved by the introduction of passive downdraught cooling. This low-energy technique enables cooled air to be distributed throughout the building without mechanical assistance. The underlying principles of the technique were explored using physical models and the anticipated performance predicted using thermal modelling. The architectural integration is illustrated and the control strategy described. The resulting building is believed to be the first large-scale application of the passive downdraught cooling technique; construction began in late 2003.",1
"Most refrigerants used today are potent chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), and hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), greenhouse gases (GHG) that can contribute significantly to anthropogenic climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion. In a business-as-usual scenario, HFC emissions in 2050 have been predicted to be equivalent to 9-19% (CO(2)-eq. basis) of projected global CO(2) emissions. This percentage increases to 28-45% if projected CO(2) emissions result in a 450-ppm CO(2) stabilization scenario. Half of current direct HFC emissions are from mobile air conditioning (MAC) and alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potential (GWP) should have higher energy efficiency. The European f-Gas Directive phases out the use of refrigerants with GWP > 150, including HFC-134a (GWP = 1430) from MACs by 2017. Life-Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) identifies environmentally superior technology to minimize GHG emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning applications. The comprehensive LCCP model, GREEN-MAC-LCCP (c) focuses on the current choice among alternative refrigerants that meet the f-Gas requirement starting in 201 Using GREEN-MAC-LCCP (c) we estimate that the current MAC technology based on HFC-134a refrigerant demands additional fuel during vehicle A/C operation in the: USA by 7%, in the EU by 7%, in Japan by 9%, in India by 15-20%, and in China by 7-10% depending on the humidity. We compare these data with the projected LCCP CO(2)-eq. savings by the year 2017 when HFC-134a will be replaced by a low GWP alternative (GWP < 150) according to the f-Gas rule. We find that refrigerant HFO-1234yf has the potential to reduce global LCCP CO(2)-eq. greenhouse gas emissions by about 7% in 2017, whereas greenhouse gas emissions from air conditioning systems using R-744 (carbon dioxide) refrigerants are estimated to be about 2% greater, compared to the current HFC-134a MAC baseline systems.

"There is a great interest, especially in Western Canada, to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel fired power plants and utilize it as a flooding agent for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. This concept provides two important benefits: (i) captured CO2 can be utilized as a flooding agent which would generate revenue from incremental oil production, and (ii) CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are reduced, helping to alleviate global warming. In the past few years, a number of feasibility studies and pilot projects on CO2 extraction from power plants have been performed. However, these results have shown that even though it is technically feasible to extract CO2 from power plants, the EOR application cost is high in the current crude petroleum market. A major reason for the high cost is that the CO2 extracting process requires a substantial amount of steam. This paper will demonstrate how cogeneration concepts would help to reduce CO2 production costs by utilizing low-pressure steams and waste heats from various sections of the power generation processes. The economics are based on the installation of a power generation plant and CO2 recovery facility in an existing oil producing facility.",1
"No matter what humans do, their levels of metabolic activity are linked to the climatic conditions of the land surface. On the one hand, the productivity of the terrestrial biosphere provides the source of chemical free energy to drive human metabolic activity. On the other hand, human metabolic activity results in the generation of heat within the body. The release of that heat to the surrounding environment is potentially constrained by the climatic conditions at the land surface. Both of these factors are intimately linked to climate: Climatic constraints act upon the productivity of the terrestrial biosphere and thereby the source of free energy, and the climatic conditions near the surface constrain the loss of heat from the human body to its surrounding environment. These two constraints are associated with a fundamental trade-off, which should result in a distinct maximum in possible levels of human metabolic activity for certain climatic conditions. For present-day conditions, tropical regions are highly productive and provide a high supply rate of free energy. But the tropics are also generally warm and humid, resulting in a low ability to loose heat, especially during daylight. Contrary, polar regions are much less productive, but allow for much higher levels of heat loss to the environment. This trade-off should therefore result in an optimum latitude (and altitude) at which the climatic environment allows humans to be metabolically most active and perform maximum levels of physical work. Both of these constraints are affected by the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide pCO (2), but in contrary ways, so that I further hypothesize that an optimum concentration of pCO (2) exists and that the optimum latitude shifts with pCO (2). I evaluate these three hypotheses with model simulations of an Earth system model of intermediate complexity which includes expressions for the two constraints on maximum possible levels of human metabolic activity. This model is used to perform model simulations for the present-day and sensitivity experiments to different levels of pCO (2). The model simulations support the three hypotheses and quantify the conditions under which these apply. Although the quantification of these constraints on human metabolic activity is grossly simplified in the approach taken here, the predictions following from this approach are consistent with the geographic locations of where higher civilizations first emerged. Applied to past climatic changes, this perspective can explain why major evolutionary events in human evolutionary history took place at times of global cooling. I conclude that the quantification of these constraints on human metabolic activity is a meaningful and quantitative measure of the ""human habitability"" of the Earth's climate. When anthropogenic climate change is viewed from this perspective, an important implication is that global warming is likely to lead to environmental conditions less suitable for human metabolic activity in their natural environment (and for large mammals in general) due to a lower ability to loose heat.",1
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the global mean surface air temperature will increase about 2 degrees C above the 1990 level by 2100. Such an increase in temperature may result in an increase in the number of generations per year of most insects. Several simulation models have been constructed to predict the increase in the number of generations, but these require a great deal of calculation to obtain estimates for many insect species at various locations under various scenarios of global warming. This paper proposes an analytical method to enable a quick estimation. Two assumptions are used: (1) The developmental rate of insects is approximately given by a linear function of temperature (T), with a developmental zero (T(0)) and a thermal constant (K). (2) The increase in temperature is approximately even throughout the year. Let m be the current annual mean temperature at a given location, and Delta T the potential increase in temperature under global warming at the location. If the temperature before the Delta T-rise is higher than T(0) in summer and lower than (T(0)-Delta T) in winter, the increase in the number of generations per year, which is denoted by Delta N, is approximately given by Delta N approximate to Delta T[c + d(m - T(0))]/K, where c and d are constants. The validity of the approximation is checked using the ""smoothed daily normals"" in Japan obtained as a running mean of 15 successive daily normals where a daily normal is defined as the averaged daily temperatures for 30 years from 1960 to 1990. The estimates are c=204.4 and d=12.46. Using this formula, linear isoclines of Delta N are plotted in a graph of T(0) versus K. By plotting the T(0) and K of various insects in this graph, we can estimate the increase in the number of generations under global warming in temperate zones.",1
"The loggerhead sea turtle is an endangered species exposed to many anthropogenic hazards in the Pacific. It is widely held that pelagic longline fisheries pose the major risk for Pacific loggerheads but the effects of other risk factors such as human-induced global climate change have rarely been considered. So we used generalised additive regression modelling and autoregressive-prewhitened cross-correlation analysis to explore whether regional ocean temperatures affect the long-term nesting population dynamics for the 2 Pacific loggerhead genetic stocks (Japan, Australia). We found that both Pacific stocks have been exposed to slowly increasing trends in mean annual sea surface temperature in their respective core regional foraging habitats over the past 50 years. We show that irrespective of whether a population was decreasing or increasing that there was an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature in the core foraging region during the year prior to the summer nesting season. Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperatures are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity. So warming regional ocean temperatures could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment unless Pacific loggerheads adapt by shifting their foraging habitat to cooler regions. So the gradual warming of the Pacific Ocean over the past 50 years is a major risk factor that must be considered in any meaningful diagnosis of the long-term declines apparent for some Pacific loggerhead nesting populations.

"The aim of this paper is to report on the development of regional climate change scenarios for Kazakhstan as the result of increasing of CO2 concentration in the global atmosphere. These scenarios are used in the assessment of climate change impacts on the agricultural, forest and water resources of Kazakhstan. Climate change scenarios for Kazakhstan to assess both long-term (2 x CO2 in 2075) and short-term (2000, 2010 and 2030) impacts were prepared. The climate conditions under increasing CO2 concentration were estimated from three General Circulation Models (GCM) outputs: the model of the Canadian Climate Center Model (CCCM), the model of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and the 1% transient version of the GFDL model (GFDL-T). The near-term climate scenarios were obtained using the probabilistic forecast model (PFM) to the year 2010 and the results of GFDL-T for years 2000 and 2030. A baseline scenario representing the current climate conditions based on observations from 1951 to 1980 was developed. The assessment of climate change in Kazakhstan based on the analysis of 100-years observations is given too. As a result of comparisons of the current climate (based on observed climate) the 1 x CO2 output from GCMs showed that the GFDL model best matches the observed climate. The GFDL model suggests that the minimum increase in temperature is expected in winter, when most of the territory is expected to have temperatures 2.3-4.5 degrees C higher. The maximum (4.3 to 8.2 degrees C) is expected to be in spring. CCCM scenario estimates an extreme warming above 11 degrees C in spring months. GFDL-T outputs provide an 'intermediate' scenario.",1
"Changes in carbon use efficiency (CUE), which is defined as the ratio of net primary production (NPP) to gross primary production (GPP), were analyzed for Abies veitchii Lindl. forests with respect to stand development by developing a simple mathematical model incorporating data on physiological variables and leaf mass ratio. A decrease in CUE with stand development was successfully expressed as a function of stand biomass (y) based on the following three assumptions: (1) a power-law relationship between mean respiration and mean individual tree mass, (2) a power-functional relationship between mean gross primary production and mean individual tree mass, and (3) self-thinning relationship between stand biomass and density. Based on this model, a parameter of CUE-y relationship was defined, and it was clarified that CUE decrease with stand development is caused not by the ratio of specific respiration rate to specific gross photosynthetic rate, but by leaf mass ratio. Since CUE is high in young forests, helpful information on selecting woody species when planting seedlings was provided from the viewpoints of reducing CO(2) in the atmosphere and global warming.

"Potential environmental impacts associated with aerobic in-vessel composting and bioreactor landfilling were assessed using life cycle inventory (LCI) tool. LCI models for solid waste management (SWM) were also developed and used to compare environmental burdens of alternative SWM scenarios. Results from the LCI models showed that the estimated energy recovery from bioreactor landfilling was about 9.6 megajoules (MJ) per kilogram (kg) of waste. Air emissions from in-vessel composting contributed to a global warming potential (GWP) of 0.86 kg of CO2-equivalent per kg of waste, compared to 54 kg of CO2-equivalent from bioreactor landfill. Waterborne emissions contributing to aquatic toxicity is less coming from in-vessel composting than from bioreactor landfilling. However, emissions to air and water that contribute to human toxicity are greater for the composting option than for the landfill option. Full costs for in- vessel composting is about 6 times greater than for the landfilling alternative. Integration of individually collected commingled recyclables, yard wastes, and residual wastes with windrow composting and bioreactor landfilling produces airborne and waterborne emissions with the least environmental effects among the alternatives considered. It also yields greater energy savings due to the conversion of the landfill gas (LFG) to electrical energy than the option that diverts yard waste, food waste and soiled paper for aerobic in-vessel composting. However, this scenario costs 68% more than that where the commingled collection of wastes is integrated with in-vessel composting and conventional landfilling, owing to increased collection costs.",1
"It is reported that seaweeds help to prevent global warming and decrease eutrophication by fixing carbon dioxide and absorbing nutrients such as nitrogen. From June 2007 to June 2008, we investigated the annual net production and annual carbon and nitrogen absorptions of Eisenia arborea in the eastern coast of Ise Bay. The annual production in terms of dry weight was estimated by counting the number of new bladelets and was found to be 5.23 d.w.kg m(-2)y(-1). The annual carbon and nitrogen absorptions were estimated by measuring their concentrations in the bladelets; these were found to be 13 kgC m(-2)y(-1) and 0.09 kgN m(-2)y(-1), respectively.",1
The concept of Earth's thermal balance is used to suggest that solar energy absorbed by a planet is equal to the heat radiated from that planet. Such an approach substantially simplifies estimating the anthropogenic warming of the planet. We compare the solar irradiance with the current heat production caused by burning different kinds of fuel. We show that anthropogenic heating is able to cause global warming of 1 degrees C in a century.,1
"Policy enabling tropical forests to approach their potential contribution to global-climate-change mitigation requires forecasts of land use and carbon storage on a large scale over long periods. In this paper, we present an integrated modeling methodology that addresses these needs. We model the dynamics of the human land-use system and of C pools contained in each ecosystem, as well as their interactions. The model is national scale, and is currently applied in a preliminary way to Costa Rica using data spanning a period of over 50 years. It combines an ecological process model, parameterized using field and other data, with an economic model, estimated using historical data to ensure a close link to actual behavior. These two models are linked so that ecological conditions affect land-use choices and vice versa. The integrated model predicts land use and its consequences for C storage for policy scenarios. These predictions can be used to create baselines, reward sequestration, and estimate the value in both environmental and economic terms of including C sequestration in tropical forests as part of the efforts to mitigate global climate change. The model can also be used to assess the benefits from costly activities to increase accuracy and thus reduce errors and their societal costs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The German electricity sector has recently seen extensive planning and construction of new coal-fired power plants. Within a period of only a few years, new investments amounting to around 15% of the total sector capacity were brought on the way, and plans for a multitude of additional projects are pending. This 'dash for coal' in Germany has raised considerable public concern, especially as it risks to undermine recent political attempts to combat global warming. Yet, the question of why the dash for coal has emerged has not yet been addressed in a thorough analysis. This article attempts to close this research gap, while at the same time contributing as a case study to the general understanding of investment patterns in liberalized electricity markets. It finds that the main reasons for the dash have been (1) replacement requirements due to the nuclear phase out, (2) the onset of a new investment cycle in the power market, (3) favorable economic and technological prospects for coal compared with natural gas in the long run, (4) a status-quo bias of investors in regard to future renewable deployment, (5) explicit political support for coal, and (6) the ineffectiveness of public protest in hampering new projects.

"The nature of the multidecadal variability in the North Atlantic basin is investigated through detailed analysis of multicentury integrations performed using the low-resolution version of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3), a modern atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model. Specifically, the results of control simulations under both preindustrial and present-day perpetual seasonal cycle conditions are compared to each other and also to the results of five simulations with increasing CO2 concentration scenarios. In the absence of greenhouse gas-induced warming, the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) variability is shown to be dependent on the details of the simulation. In the present-day control simulation, the MOC is characterized by a broad spectrum of low frequencies, whereas, in preindustrial control simulations, MOC variability is characterized either by a well-defined periodicity of 60 yr or by a broad spectrum of low frequencies. In all the control simulations, the MOC appears to respond with a delay of 10 yr to synchronous temperature and salinity anomalies in the deep water formation sites located in the subpolar gyre, but salinity dominates the density anomalies. The explanation of the modeled MOC periodicity is therefore sought in the creation of these density anomalies. The influence of increased sea ice coverage under cold/preindustrial conditions is shown to modify the salinity variability, but it is not a sufficient condition for the support of the MOC periodicity. Instead, its source appears to be a modified subpolar gyre circulation resulting from interaction with the bottom bathymetry, which is able to sustain strong coupling between the horizontal and overturning circulations. Based on the global warming analyses, for the simulations initialized from the cold/preindustrial statistical equilibrium run, the North Atlantic variability continues to be dominated by strong coupling between the horizontal and overturning circulations if the imposed forcing is weak. More generally, the delayed response of the MOC to surface density anomalies in the deep water formation regions is preserved under weak forcing.",1
"Continuing increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) will likely be accompanied by global warming. Our research objectives were (a) to determine the effects of season-long exposure to daytime maximum/nighttime minimum temperatures of 32/22, 36/26, 40/30 and 44/34degreesC at ambient (350 mumol mol(-1)) and elevated (700 mumol mol(-1)) CO2 on reproductive processes and yield of peanut, and (b) to evaluate whether the higher photosynthetic rates and vegetative growth at elevated CO2 will negate the detrimental effects of high temperature on reproductive processes and yield. Doubling of CO2 increased leaf photosynthesis and seed yield by 27% and 30%, respectively, averaged across all temperatures. There were no effects of elevated CO2 on pollen viability, seed-set, seed number per pod, seed size, harvest index or shelling percentage. At ambient CO2, seed yield decreased progressively by 14%, 59% and 90% as temperature increased from 32/22 to 36/26, 40/30 and 44/34degreesC, respectively. Similar percentage decreases in seed yield occurred at temperatures above 32/22degreesC at elevated CO2 despite greater photosynthesis and vegetative growth. Decreased seed yields at high temperature were a result of lower seed-set due to poor pollen viability, and smaller seed size due to decreased seed growth rates and decreased shelling percentages. Seed harvest index decreased from 0.41 to 0.05 as temperature increased from 32/22 to 44/34degreesC under both ambient and elevated CO2. We conclude that there are no beneficial interactions between elevated CO2 and temperature, and that seed yield of peanut will decrease under future warmer climates, particularly in regions where present temperatures are near or above optimum.",1
"Energy consumption in data centers is increasing dramatically as the information technology (IT) infrastructure provides higher speeds and capacities and the deployment of IT equipment expands. In a data center, the percentage of energy consumed by air conditioning is high at about 40%, and reducing this energy use has become a major issue against the background of global warming. To make detailed temperature measurements with the aim of achieving energy-efficient data centers, we have developed multipoint measuring technology to increase the spatial resolution by more than twice that of existing technology. This uses a new algorithm for correcting signal processing output from temperature-distribution measuring equipment that utilizes Raman-scattering light in an optical fiber. We have also developed technology for fast and reliable laying of optical fiber on server racks. These technologies enable accurate and detailed measurement of temperature distributions in data centers, which should in turn lead to optimal air conditioning and an energy-saving effect.",1
"The problem of global warming arises from the buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels and other human activities that change the composition of the atmosphere and alter outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). One geoengineering solution being proposed is to reduce the incoming sunshine by emulating a volcanic eruption. In between the incoming solar radiation and the OLR is the entire weather and climate system and the hydrological cycle. The precipitation and streamflow records from 1950 to 2004 are examined for the effects of volcanic eruptions from El Chichon in March 1982 and Pinatubo in June 1991, taking into account changes from El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 there was a substantial decrease in precipitation over land and a record decrease in runoff and river discharge into the ocean from October 1991-September 1992. The results suggest that major adverse effects, including drought, could arise from geoengineering solutions.",1
"The first GCM climate change projections to include dynamic vegetation and an interactive carbon cycle produced a very significant amplification of global warming over the 21st century. Under the IS92a ""business as usual"" emissions scenario CO2 concentrations reached about 980 ppmv by 2100, which is about 280 ppmv higher than when these feedbacks were ignored. The major contribution to the increased CO2 arose from reductions in soil carbon because global warming is assumed to accelerate respiration. However, there was also a lesser contribution from an alarming loss of the Amazonian rainforest. This paper describes the phenomenon of Amazonian forest dieback under elevated CO2 in the Hadley Centre climate-carbon cycle model.",1
"As a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Israel is committed to develop a national inventory of anthropogenic emissions and removals of greenhouse gases. This paper presents the national inventory, which was developed according to the guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The inventory includes the following sectors: energy, industrial processes, agriculture, forestry and waste. In this paper, only the inventory of the direct greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) is presented. Emissions of these gases were converted to CO2 equivalent emissions by means of their Global Warming Potentials (a measure of the radiative effects of the different gases relatively to CO2). CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels to produce energy are by far the largest source (50 million tons in 1996). The contribution of methane emissions from decomposition of landfilled municipal solid waste is second in importance (8 million tons of CO2 equivalent). Industrial processes emit about 2 million tons CO2 equivalent, the most important process being cement production. Agricultural emissions amount to about 2 million tons CO2 equivalent and are due to soil emissions of nitrous oxide, methane emissions from enteric fermentation in domestic livestock and N2O and CH4 emissions from animal waste management. Although most forests in Israel are in a growing stage and atmospheric CO2 is therefore removed to form biomass, this removal amounts to 0.4 million tons only and is very small as compared to emissions from other sectors. On a per capita basis, Israel's emissions of CO2 from fuel combustion are not far behind those of some of the most developed countries.",1
"Simple equations are developed to express regional climate changes for the twenty-first century and associated uncertainty in terms of the global temperature change (GTC) without a dependence on the underlying emission pathways. The equations are applied to regional temperature and precipitation changes over different regions of the world, and relevant parameters are calculated using the latest multimodel ensemble of global climate change simulations. Examples are also shown of how to use the equations to develop probability density functions (PDFs) of regional climate change based on PDFs of GTC. The main advantage of these equations is that they can be used to estimate regional changes from GTC obtained either from simple and intermediate complexity models or from target CO. stabilization concentrations.",1
"As is well known, greenhouse-effect gases causes serious global warming, and it is very important problem for the 21st century. The authors observed the greenhouse-effect of carbon dioxide, whose contribution ratio to warming is most high. Now the concentration of carbon dioxide is presently approximately 350 ppm, and is estimated to become 400 ppm in the year 2000. An absorption-fixation method was applied photosynthesis by Water Hyacinth an aquatic plant. Also, an apparatus was developed that can accurately measure the concentration of carbon dioxide. The authors suggest a plant-cultivating apparatus whose temperature, humidity and illumination can be controlled, and maintains the interior of the cultivating room at constant conditions, for growing Water Hyacinth. A continuous 24-hours measurement was carried out of carbon dioxide in the cultivating apparatus using a gas chromatograph with an auto sampler. We could accurately measure the carbon dioxide concentration in plant cultivating apparatus using this apparatus.",1
"The combined effects of increasing industrialization around the world, the threat of global climate change, and decreasing availability of ""clean"" fossil fuels will make the development of alternative energy sources more important in the coming decades. For fission-based nuclear power to contribute significantly to future energy supplies, it will be essential to maintain the improvements that have been made in plant operational efficiency, to license geological repositories for waste disposal, and to consider again the issue of recycling of spent nuclear fuels to recover its fuel value and to reduce the long-term radiotoxicity of the wastes. In this chapter, we present an overview of the nuclear fuel cycle from spent fuel recycling through the repository performance in the context of its importance to energy production in the 21(st) Century.

"South Asian summer monsoon (June through September) rainfall simulation and its potential future changes are evaluated in a multi-model ensemble of global coupled climate models outputs under World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (WCRP CMIP3) dataset. The response of South Asian summer monsoon to a transient increase in future anthropogenic radiative forcing is investigated for two time slices, middle (2031-2050) and end of the twenty-first century (2081-2100), in the non-mitigated Special Report on Emission Scenarios B1, A1B and A2 .There is large inter-model variability in the simulation of spatial characteristics of seasonal monsoon precipitation. Ten out of the 25 models are able to simulate space-time characteristics of the South Asian monsoon precipitation reasonably well. The response of these selected ten models has been examined for projected changes in seasonal monsoon rainfall. The multi-model ensemble of these ten models projects a significant increase in monsoon precipitation with global warming. The substantial increase in precipitation is observed over western equatorial Indian Ocean and southern parts of India. However, the monsoon circulation weakens significantly under all the three climate change experiments. Possible mechanisms for the projected increase in precipitation and for precipitation-wind paradox have been discussed. The surface temperature over Asian landmass increases in pre-monsoon months due to global warming and heat low over northwest India intensifies. The dipole snow configuration over Eurasian continent strengthens in warmer atmosphere, which is conducive for the enhancement in precipitation over Indian landmass. No notable changes have been projected in the El Nio-Monsoon relationship, which is useful for predicting interannual variations of the monsoon.",1
"Increased decomposition rates in boreal peatlands with global warming might increase the release of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thereby producing a positive feedback to global warming. How temperature influences microbial decomposers is unclear. We measured in vitro rates of decomposition of senesced sedge leaves and rhizomes (Carex aquatilis), from a fen, and peat moss (Sphagnum fuscum), from a bog, at 14 and 20degreesC by the three most frequently isolated fungi and bacteria from these materials. Decomposition rates of the bog litter decreased (5- to 17-fold) with elevated temperatures, and decomposition of the sedge litters was either enhanced (2- to 30-fold) or remained unaffected by elevated temperatures. The increased temperature regime always favoured fungal over bacterial decomposition rates (2- to 3-fold). Different physiological characteristics of these microbes suggest that fungi using polyphenolic polymers as a carbon source cause greater mass losses of these litters. Litter quality exerted a stronger influence on decomposition at elevated temperatures, as litter rich in nutrients decomposed more quickly than litter poorer in nutrients at higher temperatures (8.0%-25.7% for the sedge litters vs. 0.2% for the bryophyte litter). We conclude that not all peatlands may provide a positive feedback to global warming. Cautious extrapolation of our data to the ecosystem level suggests that decomposition rates in fens may increase and those in bogs may decrease under a global warming scenario.",1
"The global environmental consequences of CO2 discharge resulting from energy use are causing mounting concern regarding the sustainability of our development in the future. Japan successfully overcame two energy crisis in the 1970s despite the fragile nature of its energy structure and was able to maintain economic growth, resulting in a dramatic improvement in its industrial technology as a whole. Noteworthy is that such efforts were successful because they included such means as substituting an unconstrained production factor (technology) for a constrained production factor (energy) in a manner similar to an ecosystem. Given the two-directional nature of CO2 discharge and energy consumption, the experience of Japan can provide informative suggestions in response to current worldwide concerns regarding global warming due to CO2 discharge. However, Japan may now face the prospect of energy and environmental constraints again following the fall of international oil prices. In response, MITI established the New Sunshine Program (R&D program on Energy and Environmental Technologies) by integrating related R&D programs. A PV power generation system is one of the priority projects in the Program.",1
"If the ongoing phenomenon of global warming prevails, three main consequences are expected in tropical seas: a higher sea level, a reduction in coral reefs and more intense cyclones. What will shallow-marine carbonate systems be like? Insights can be gained from the Pyrenean Urbasa-Andia Formation, a transgressive heterozoan-like foralgal (larger foraminiferal and red algal) ramp that formed in Middle Eocene times, a greenhouse interval characterized by high atmospheric CO2 content. Firstly, the evolution of future tropical shallow-marine systems subject to a sea-level rise is very likely to be similar to that seen in the backstepping architecture of the Urbasa-Andia Formation. Secondly, Eocene larger foraminifers rose when the Paleocene-Eocene hyperthermal event caused a decline in corals in tropical seas. Coral reefs are again among the ecosystems that are likely to be particularly affected by current global warming. It is therefore probable that future shallow-marine tropical ecosystems will be devoid of platform margin coral reefs, heterozoan ramps being far more common. Thirdly, strong storm influence was common on the Urbasa-Andia carbonate ramp, the most distinctive feature being a distal dune field that was formed below storm wave base by high-energy return currents. Similar features also characterize other Eocene carbonate ramps. Furthermore, numerical simulations highlighted the effect of strong tropical cyclones during the equable climate of the Eocene. Together this information supports the hypothesis that tropical cyclone activity may increase under future greenhouse conditions. Taking everything into account, the transgressive storm-dominated foralgal ramp represented by the Urbasa-Andia Formation can be used as a virtual analogue of future shallow-marine carbonate sedimentary environments developed under greenhouse conditions.

"Based on a recognition of the essence of climate change and the pressure on China to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, this paper interprets the important role that the Chinese iron and steel industry may play in managing emissions. Through an investigation of he key sources of GHG emissions in the Chinese iron and steel industry, a comparison of the current Chinese and international situations, and a survey of the technology and methods available for reducing GHG emissions, and their application in China, the authors analyze the major issues currently faced by the Chinese iron and steel industry, and propose the following four approaches through which the industry might reduce its GHG emissions: (1) encouragement of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects, mainly involving secondary energy reuse, to provide capital and technology for GHG reduction activities in China; (2) stimulation of the social responsibility-based voluntary carbon market (VCM) to increase the long-term benefits for the Chinese iron and steel industry from emission reductions; (3) undertaking of strict energy auditing to help enterprises establish appropriate emission reduction targets and formulate reasonable plans: (4) promotion of emission reduction-oriented investment within the industry to obtain profits from project operation, while at the same time gaining extra compensation for emission reductions. More specifically, the design of each of these approaches should take into consideration the related economic factors and incentive mechanisms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The environmental effect of globalisation has been debated intensively in the last decades. Only few well-documented analyses of global versus local product alternatives exist, whilst recommendations on buying local are vast. At the same time, the European Environmental Agency's Third Assessment concludes that the resource use within the EU is stabilising at the expense of increased resource use for import of products to the EU. Taking its point of departure in vegetable oils, this article compares rapeseed oil and palm oil as a local and a global alternative for meeting the increasing demand for these products in the EU. By using detailed life cycle assessment (LCA), this study compares the environmental impacts and identifies alternative ways of producing rapeseed oil and palm oil to the EU market in order to reduce environmental impacts. The consequential approach for system delimitation is applied (Ekvall and Weidema 2004; Weidema 2003; Schmidt 2008a; Schmidt and Weidema 2008). This approach differs from the attributional approach in a way that the actual affected suppliers and technologies are modelled instead of averages. In addition, co-product allocation is avoided by system expansion. The method for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is EDIP97 updated (LCA-Center 2007). In addition, land use and the associated impacts on biodiversity are assessed using the LCIA method described in Schmidt (2008b). The characterised results of the LCA show that palm oil is environmentally preferable to rapeseed oil within ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical smog and land use, whilst the differences within global warming and biodiversity are less clear. The most significant process contributing to global warming from rapeseed oil is the cultivation of rapeseed, whilst the oil palm cultivation and the palm oil mill (effluent treatment) are equally important. Regarding land use and biodiversity for rapeseed oil, the avoided production caused by system expansion has a major role, whilst system expansion has only limited effect on the results of palm oil. Alternative cultivation practices and technologies are assessed. The findings for rapeseed oil are that local expansions of the cultivated area on set-aside area is preferable to displacement of crops which are compensated for by increased agricultural production abroad and that the full press technology in the oil mill is preferable to solvent extraction. Concerning palm oil, cultivation on peat increases the contribution to global warming significantly with a factor of 4-5 compared to cultivation on the current mix of soils types. The other hotspot related to global warming (effluent treatment) can be markedly reduced by installation of digester tanks and subsequent utilisation of biogas. The results of the scenarios show that the approach to system delimitation matters. When the consequential approach to system delimitation is applied in the agricultural stage, uncertainties show to be significant. These uncertainties are mainly related to the determination of how increased production is achieved, increased cultivated area and/or increased intensification. Overall, palm oil tends to be environmentally preferable to rapeseed oil within all impact categories except global warming, biodiversity and ecotoxicity where the difference is less pronounced and where it is highly dependent on the assumptions regarding system delimitation in the agricultural stage. Since the environmental performance of rapeseed oil and palm oil is a result of the current applied technologies and since improvement options exist in both product systems, it may be more relevant for decision makers to focus on requirements on the applied technologies in the product systems rather than preferring the one oil over the other.",1
"The transient responses of two versions of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled climate model to a climate change forcing scenario are examined. The same computer codes were used to construct the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface components of the two models, and they employ the same types of sub-grid-scale parameterization schemes. The two model versions differ primarily, but not solely, in their spatial resolution. Comparisons are made of results from six coarse-resolution R 15 climate change experiments and three medium-resolution R30 experiments in which levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and sulfate aerosols are specified to change over time. The two model versions yield similar global mean surface air temperature responses until the second half of the 21st century, after which the R15 model exhibits a somewhat larger response. Polar amplification of the Northern Hemisphere's warming signal is more pronounced in the R15 model, in part due to the R15's cooler control climate, which allows for larger snow and ice albedo positive feedbacks. Both models project a substantial weakening of the North Atlantic overturning circulation and a large reduction in the volume of Arctic sea ice to occur in the 21st century. Relative to their respective control integrations, there is a greater reduction of Arctic sea ice in the R15 experiments than in the R30 simulations as the climate system warms. The globally averaged annual mean precipitation rate is simulated to increase over time, with both model versions projecting an increase of about 8% to occur by the decade of the 2080s. While the global mean precipitation response is quite similar in the two models, regional differences exist, with the R30 model displaying larger increases in equatorial regions.

"We explore the extent to which chemistry-aerosol-climate coupling influences predictions of future ozone and aerosols as well as future climate using the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) general circulation model II' with on-line simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry and sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, primary organic carbon, and secondary organic carbon aerosols. Based on IPCC scenario A2, year 2100 ozone, aerosols, and climate simulated with full chemistry-aerosol-climate coupling are compared with those simulated from a stepwise approach. In the stepwise method year 2100 ozone and aerosols are first simulated using present-day climate and year 2100 emissions (denoted as simulation CHEM2100sw) and year 2100 climate is then predicted using offline monthly fields of O-3 and aerosols from CHEM2100sw (denoted as simulation CLIM2100sw). The fully coupled chemistry-aerosol-climate simulation predicts a 15% lower global burden of O3 for year 2100 than the simulation CHEM2100sw which does not account for future changes in climate. Relative to CHEM2100sw, year 2100 column burdens of all aerosols in the fully coupled simulation exhibit reductions of 10-20 mg m(-2) in DJF and up to 10 mg m(-2) in JJA in mid to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, reductions of up to 20 mg m(-2) over the eastern United States, northeastern China, and Europe in DJF, and increases of 30-50 mg m(-2) over populated and biomass burning areas in JJA. As a result, relative to year 2100 climate simulated from CLIM2100sw, full chemistry-aerosol-climate coupling leads to a stronger net global warming by greenhouse gases, tropospheric ozone and aerosols in year 2100, with a global and annual mean surface air temperature higher by 0.42 K. For simulation of year 2100 aerosols, we conclude that it is important to consider the positive feedback between future aerosol direct radiative forcing and future aerosol concentrations; increased aerosol concentrations lead to reductions in convection and precipitation (or wet deposition of aerosols), further increasing lower tropospheric aerosol concentrations.",1
"To distinguish between natural and anthropogenic forcing, the supposedly ongoing global warming needs to be put in a longer, geological perspective. When the last ca. 20 000 yr of climate development is reviewed, including the climatically dramatic period when the Last Ice Age ended, the Last Termination, it appears that the last centuries of globally rising temperatures should be regarded as an anomaly. Other, often synchronous climate events are not expressed in a globally consistent way, but rather are the expression of the complexities of the climate system. Due to the often poor precision in the dating of older proxy records, such a statement will obviously be met with some opposition. However, as long as no globally consistent climate event prior to today's global warming has been clearly documented, and considering that climate trends during the last millennia in different parts of the world have, in the last century or so, changed direction into a globally warming trend, we ought to regard the ongoing changes as anomalies, triggered by anthropogenically forced alterations of the carbon cycle in the general global environment.",1
"Ongoing global warming could persist far into the future, because natural processes require decades to hundreds of thousands of years to remove carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel burning from the atmosphere(1-3). Future warming may have large global impacts including ocean oxygen depletion and associated adverse effects on marine life, such as more frequent mortality events(4-8), but long, comprehensive simulations of these impacts are currently not available. Here we project global change over the next 100,000 years using a low-resolution Earth system model(9), and find severe, long-term ocean oxygen depletion, as well as a great expansion of ocean oxygen-minimum zones for scenarios with high emissions or high climate sensitivity. We find that climate feedbacks within the Earth system amplify the strength and duration of global warming, ocean heating and oxygen depletion. Decreased oxygen solubility from surface-layer warming accounts for most of the enhanced oxygen depletion in the upper 500 m of the ocean. Possible weakening of ocean overturning and convection lead to further oxygen depletion, also in the deep ocean. We conclude that substantial reductions in fossil-fuel use over the next few generations are needed if extensive ocean oxygen depletion for thousands of years is to be avoided.",1
"Development of biofuels from renewable resources is critical to the sustainability of the world's economy and to slow down the global climate change. Currently, a significant amount of bioethanol and biodiesel are produced as biofuels to partially replace gasoline and diesel, respectively, in the transportation sector worldwide. However, these biofuels represent a tiny portion (<4%) of the total fuels consumed. Furthermore, bioethanol is produced predominantly from sugarcane and corn, and biodiesel from crop and plant oils. Production of these raw materials is competing for the limited arable land against food and feed production. It is not feasible to tremendously increase biofuel production using the current technologies. Therefore, it is critical to investigate advanced or 2nd generation biofuel production technologies. This article is trying to summarize the current status of the 2nd generation biofuel technologies including bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials and biodiesel from microalgae. The summary includes the descriptions of the technologies, their advantages and challenges, feedstocks for the 2nd generation biofuels, the key barriers to their commercial applications, and future perspectives of the advanced technologies.

"Clean and renewable energy technologies using ocean energy give us non-polluting alternatives to fossil-fueled power plants as a countermeasure against global warming and growing demand for electrical energy Among the ocean energy resources, wave power takes a growing interest because of its enormous amount of potential energy m the world Therefore, various types of wave power systems to capture the energy of ocean waves have been developed However, a suitable turbine type is not yet normalized because of relatively low efficiency of the turbine systems The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a newly developed direct drive hydro turbine (DDT), which will be built in a caisson for a wave power plant Experiment and CFD analysis are conducted to clarify the turbine performance and internal flow characteristics The results show that the DDT obtains fairly good turbine efficiency in cases with and without wave conditions Most of the output power is generated at the runner passage of Stage 2 Relatively larger amount of the decreased tangential velocity at Stage 2 produces more angular momentum than that at Stage 1 and thus, the larger angular momentum at the Stage 2 makes a greater contribution to the generation of total output power in comparison with that at Stage 1 Large vortex existing in the upper-left region of the runner passage forms a large recirculation region in the runner passage, and the recirculating flow consumes the output power at Region 2",1
"The upcoming ban on battery cages in the European Union is expected to cause a shift in husbandry systems from predominantly battery cages to enriched cages and loose housing systems, such as barn, free range and organic systems. To gain insight into ecological and economic consequences of such a ban, we quantified the ecological and economic performance of the most commonly used egg production systems in the Netherlands, and identified which parameters explain differences in performance. We included the conventional battery cage system and the following loose housing systems: single and multi-tiered barn systems, single and multi-tiered free range systems, and single and multi-tiered organic systems. Ecological indicators used were deduced from a life cycle assessment, and were: global warming potential, energy use, land occupation, fossil phosphorus use, acidification potential, nitrogen and phosphorus deficit, and nitrogen and phosphorus surplus, each expressed per kg of egg. Economic indicator used was net farm income per full time employee. Based on our ecological evaluation of Dutch egg production systems, we predict that a ban on battery cages in the European Union will increase global warming potential, land occupation and acidification potential per kg of egg produced, whereas the effect on energy use, fossil phosphorus use, nitrogen and phosphorus deficit, and nitrogen and phosphorus surplus depends on relative importance of different loose housing systems. Of all loose housing systems, organic systems had lowest global warming potential, energy use, fossil phosphorus use, and nitrogen and phosphorus surplus, whereas land occupation and nitrogen and phosphorus deficit was lowest for barn systems. Acidification potential was lowest for a multi-tiered barn system. Differences in LCA results among production systems can be explained mainly by differences; in feed conversion, in parameters that determine ecological impact per kg feed ingredient (e.g., crop yield per ha; number field operations, type and amount of fertilization), in drying of grain, in transport of concentrates and manure, in type of hen house and in N excretion per hen per year. Free range systems had highest net farm income, followed by organic systems. Multi-tiered systems had a higher net farm income than single-tiered systems. In case differences among egg and cost prices of different systems do not change after a ban on the battery cage, multitiered free range and organic systems are economically most favourable.

"The potential adverse human health and climate impacts of emissions from UK airports have become a significant political issue, yet the emissions, air quality impacts and health impacts attributable to UK airports remain largely unstudied. We produce an inventory of UK airport emissions including aircraft landing and takeoff (LTO) operations and airside support equipment with uncertainties quantified. The airports studied account for more than 95% of UK air passengers in 2005. We estimate that in 2005, UK airports emitted 10.2 Gg [-23 to +29%] of NO(x), 0.73 Gg [-29 to +32%] of SO(2), 17 Gg [-42 to +77%] of CO, 8 Gg [-59 to +155%] of HC, 2.4 Tg [-13 to +12%] of CO(2), and 0.31 Gg [-36 to +45%] of PM(2.5). This translates to 2.5 Tg [-12 to +12%] CO(2)-eq using Global Warming Potentials for a 100-year time horizon. Uncertainty estimates were based on analysis of data from aircraft emissions measurement campaigns and analyses of aircraft operations. The First-Order Approximation (FOA3) - currently the standard approach used to estimate particulate matter emissions from aircraft - is compared to measurements and it is shown that there are discrepancies greater than an order of magnitude for 40% of cases for both organic carbon and black carbon emissions indices. Modified methods to approximate organic carbon emissions, arising from incomplete combustion and lubrication oil, and black carbon are proposed. These alterations lead to factor 8 and a 44% increase in the annual emissions estimates of black and organic carbon particulate matter, respectively, leading to a factor 3.4 increase in total PM(2.5) emissions compared to the current FOA3 methodology. Our estimates of emissions are used in Part II to quantify the air quality and health impacts of UK airports, to assess mitigation options, and to estimate the impacts of a potential London airport expansion.

"The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar, patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.",1
"Air conditioning and dehumidification systems using solid desiccants have been developed and are finding niche applications in commercial building with special humidity problems or requirements. Ongoing research is being directed at materials and components investigations which have the promise of increasing the performance and reducing the cost of air conditioning systems to the point that they will realize broader application for building environmental control. This technical progress, coupled with intensive societal pressures for limiting the growth of peak electrical demand and release of global warming and ozone destruction gases, suggests that desiccant technology will experience an expanding penetration of the building air conditioning market.",1
"A one-dimensional global-energy-balance model is used to simulate the climate response of increasing atmospheric green house gas concentrations and sulfate aerosol loadings. Model output indicates that a change in equivalent carbon dioxide from 300 to 450 ppm produces a global warming of 0.69 degrees C (24 degrees F), and a doubling to 600 ppm generates a warming of 57 degrees C (2.83 degrees F). In both simulation experiments, the greatest warming appears in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Model results show that increasing sulfate aerosol levels generates a global cooling of 0.32 degrees C (0.58 degrees F), with the largest cooling occurring in the industrialized mid-to-h igh latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. When the effects of equivalent carbon dioxide and sulfates are simulated together to represent changes that have occurred in the past century, the model generates a global warming of 0.30 degrees C (0.54 degrees F), with the greatest warming continuing to occur in the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The latent heat transfer values, which provide a rough indication of projected trends in precipitation levels, increase globally by 2.3% as the model's representation of atmospheric composition is perturbed by greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. These basic results from the simple one-dimensional energy balance model are broadly consistent with simulations using far more sophisticated three-dimensional general circulation models and with the trends in global temperature and precipitation observed over the past century.",1

On average, annual floods inundate 20.5 per cent area of the country and this can reach as high as about 70 per cent during an extreme flood event. Floods cause serious damage to the economy of Bangladesh, a country with a low per capita income. Global warming caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect is likely to have significant effects on the hydrology and water resources of the GBM basins and might ultimately lead to more serious floods in Bangladesh. The use of climate change scenarios from four general circulation models as input into hydrological models demonstrates substantial increases in mean peak discharges in the GBM rivers. These changes may lead to changes in the occurrence of flooding with certain magnitude. Extreme flooding events will create a number of implications for agriculture, flood control and infrastructure in Bangladesh. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Global simulation models used to predict climate change typically have resolutions too coarse for resolving small drainage basins, creating a major obstacle to evaluating the hydrologic impacts of climate variability. The writers circumvent this difficulty by using a physical model for severe hurricanes to derive changes in hurricane rainfall under a predicted global warming. The modified rainfall is then transferred to a linked hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to compute the impact of global warming on hurricane-induced flooding in a susceptible watershed. As an example, using simulations of tropical, doubled-CO2 climate change, the hurricane model predicts a 40% precipitation increase for severe hurricanes affecting southeastern Florida. The 40% increase is assumed for a 100-year, three-day event used for flood-management planning in South Florida and applied to the Basin Runoff and Streamflow Simulation (BRASS) model of the Western C-11 drainage system. The increased precipitation provokes substantially greater flooding that could negate most of the benefits of present water-management practices in this basin.",1
"Role and potentials of nuclear energy system in the energy options are discussed from the viewpoint of sustainable development with protecting from global warming by using the energy module structure of GRAPE model. The analysis with respect to carbon emission control and nuclear fissile transaction among regions indicates the need of coordinated further developments of energy conservation, renewable and nuclear energies, and rather drastic nuclear introduction in the presently developing world. The analysis also suggests the need of long-term planning and R&D efforts under the wisdom. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1

"A 70-year history of precipitation 618 0 record has been retrieved using an ice core drilled from a plat portion of the firn area in the Guoqu Glacier (33 degrees 34 '37.8 '' N, 91 degrees 10'35.3 '' E, 5720 m a.s.l.) on Mt. Gelaclainclong (the source region of Yangtze River) during October and November, 2005. Based on the seasonality of delta O-18 records and the significant positive relationships between monsoon/non-monsoon delta O-18 values and summer/spring air temperature from the nearby meteorological stations, the history of summer and spring air temperature have been reconstructed for the last 70 years. The results show that both summer and spring air temperature variations present similar trends during the last 70 years. Regression analysis indicates that the slope of the temperature-delta O-18 relationship is 3 degrees C/parts per thousand. for non-monsoon delta O-18 values and spring air temperature, and 0.4 degrees C/parts per thousand. for monsoon delta O-18 values and summer air temperature. Variation of air temperature recorded in the ice core is consistent with that in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), however, the warming trend in the Gelaclainclong region is more intense than that in the NH, reflecting a higher sensitivity to global warming in the high elevation regions. In addition, warming trend is greater in spring than in summer.",1
"Seagrasses are threatened by multiple anthropogenic stressors, such as accumulating drift algae and increasing temperatures (associated with eutrophication and global warming, respectively). However, few seagrass experiments have examined whether exposure to multiple stressors causes antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects, and this has limited our ability to predict the future health status of seagrass beds. We conducted a laboratory experiment to test whether abundance of Gracilaria comosa (3 levels; 0, 2, and 3.4 kg WW m(-2)), an algae that is resistant to wide environmental fluctuations (e.g. light, temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels), has negative effects on the small ephemeral seagrass, Halophila ovalis and whether the effects are exacerbated by high temperature (3 levels; 20, 25, and 30A degrees C). We found an additive negative effect of the two stressors when tested simultaneously on 14 seagrass performance measures, with most data variability explained by the drift algae. For the individual plant performance measures (above- and below-ground growth and mortality, leaf area, internode distance, and root length and root volume), we found 5 additive effects, 4 synergistic effects, and 5 effects that were significant only for drift algae. We also documented a significant additive effect of drift algae and temperature on dissolved porewater sulphide (DS). A follow-up correlation analysis between DS and the 14 plant performance measures revealed significant or near-significant linear correlations on 9 of these responses (above- and below-ground growth, leaf area and weight, leaf mortality, and internode distance). In summary, we showed (a) that a stress-resistant drift algae can have strong negative effects on a small ephemeral seagrass, (b) this negative effect can increase both additively and synergistically with increasing temperature depending on performance measure, and (c) the negative effects may be mediated by a build-up of porewater DS. An implication of our findings is that resource managers aiming to preserve healthy seagrass beds in an almost certain future warmer world should increase efforts to keep drift algae populations low.",1
"Non-stationary time series such as global and hemispheric temperatures, greenhouse gas concentrations, solar irradiance, and anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, may contain stochastic trends (the simplest stochastic trend is a random walk) which, due to their unique patterns, can act as a signal of the influence of other variables on the series in question. Two or more series may share a common stochastic trend, which indicates that either one series causes the behavior of the other or that there is a common driving variable. Recent developments in econometrics allow analysts to detect and classify such trends and analyze relationships among series that contain stochastic trends. We apply some univariate autoregression based tests to evaluate the presence of stochastic trends in several time series for temperature and radiative forcing. The temperature and radiative forcing series are found to be of different orders of integration which would cast doubt on the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis. However, these tests can suffer from size distortions when applied to noisy series such as hemispheric temperatures. We, therefore, use multivariate structural time series techniques to decompose Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperatures into stochastic trends and autoregressive noise processes. These results show that there are two independent stochastic trends in the data. We investigate the possible origins of these trends using a regression method. Radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases and solar irradiance can largely explain the common trend. The second trend, which represents the non-scalar non-stationary differences between the hemispheres, reflects radiative forcing due to tropospheric sulfate aerosols. We find similar results when we use the same techniques to analyze temperature data generated by the Hadley Centre GCM SUL experiment.",1
"From the viewpoint of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the practical use of electric buses has been expected to be one of the effective solutions to global warming. Even though lithium-ion batteries using lithium manganese oxide have been studied for use in electric vehicles, it is still necessary to improve their characteristics such as energy density, maximum operating temperature and cycle performance. Manganese oxide lithium-ion batteries for an electric bus developed by internal-combustion spray pyrolysis methods and its performance in an actual road test have been studied. The performance of the electric bus was satisfactory; the bus could run for 74 km on a full charge.",1
"This paper aims at examining the role of CO2 removal and disposal among various measures for CO2 abatement. The first part deals with the need of CO2 removal and disposal in the strategy toward stabilization of the air concentration of CO2. A macroscopic survey of CO2 emission in developed world indicates that reduction of CO2 emission will be a hard task as long as we employ only conventional measures and therefore implementation of innovative measures is indispensable for mankind to mitigate global warming substantially. The results of a model study on CO2 stabilization indicates that CO2 removal from flue gas and storage in some niches of the earth will play an important role within several tens years. The second part deals with the issue of CO2 ocean disposal, with referring to a controversy on its effectiveness in mitigating global warming and concludes that it is effective but needs more study both on science of CO2 behavior in the ocean and characteristics of damage function of global warming. Lastly the paper discusses the global strategy for CO2 abatement, taking into full account different stances of countries in the world and stresses the importance of concerted efforts of developed countries for RandD on CO2 removal and disposal technologies.",1
"Methane, which is the main component of natural and biogases, is known to be a very strong greenhouse gas with long lasting effect in the atmosphere that contributes actively to global warming. Releases of the gas commonly described as Fugitive Gas Emissions are an important source of methane emissions. A possible approach to reduce the harmful effects of such methane emissions is to introduce the fugitive methane into a device that can convert it through combustion to less environmentally harmful products. It has been shown that the bulk of such methane can be converted into much weaker green house gases in an IDI diesel engine. However, such applications can bring about changes to engine combustion processes and the resulting performance. The present contribution reports the results of an investigation of the effect on combustion characteristics, emissions and performance of introducing very small concentrations of methane into the intake of an operating diesel engine. It is shown that for wide ranges of gas admission concentrations in the air, unlike with other conventional combustion devices such as burners and furnaces, much of the methane added was indeed oxidized in the IDI diesel engine and increased the power output and thus saving some diesel fuel. Such methane admissions tended to increase carbon monoxide emissions, indicating that part of the methane may not have been fully oxidized. NOx emission increased slightly, but when compared to the diesel operation for the same fuel energy input, it represented a reduction. Consuming a small amount of fugitive methane in the engine could bring about reductions to the global warming effect well in excess of that due to the entire engine exhaust gases resulting from diesel fuel combustion. The introduction of low concentrations of methane into the engine air hardly affected the ignition delay and the combustion duration. However, the total gross heat released and its rate showed correspondingly an increase consistent with a positive contribution of methane to engine power.",1
"It is becoming increasingly probable that emissions of carbon dioxide from the fossil fuels will have to be reduced to deal with the threat of global warming. This issue is likely to be resolved one way or the other in the period 1995 to 2000 which does not leave much time to develop responsive options. In the intervening period, the policy of the Government of Canada is to stabilize emissions of greenhouse gases at their 1990 level by 2000, by encouraging greater efficiency in the use of energy. Should further reductions prove necessary, economic instruments would probably be employed but these would not be applied before a comprehensive international agreement is reached. There are three main themes in this paper: it is assumed that measures to control carbon dioxide emissions will in fact be necessary by the turn of the century; that there will be a rising need for liquid fuels to supply the world's steadily growing fleet of motor vehicles for many years to come, and that the future niche for Canada's industry in such a carbon-constrained world will be the operation of the energy-intensive industries with efficiency and environmental sensitivity. The steel industry, as a large user of both coal and energy in other forms, would be significantly affected by a need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This paper first examines what might be called the conventional responses open to the industry in such a situation and then explores a new possibility for making better use of carbon by the co-production of iron and liquid fuels.",1
"The intensities of the tropical cyclones (TCs) that approach or make landfall in Japan and the possible changes in these intensities due to global warming have been investigated on the basis of the theoretical model of Holland (1997). This theoretical model calculates the maximum potential intensity (MPI) of a TC as a lower limit of central sea level pressure for a given upper-air temperature profile and underlying sea surface temperature (SST). This study uses the climatology of the JRA-25 long-term reanalysis for the present environment, along with global warming anomalies derived from CMIP3 multi model climate experiments, which are added to the reanalysis climatology to form a warmed environment. A characteristic of the tropical atmosphere is that warming anomalies are amplified toward the upper troposphere, so that TC intensification due to a rise in SST is suppressed to some extent by greater warming aloft. This study evaluates the uncertainty ranges for the M PI changes by considering inter model differences in the warming structure. The MPI-SST relationship in the present climate is consistent with the historical minimum surface pressure in the western North Pacific when the eyewall relative humidity (RH), one of the model's key parameters, is set at 88%. The average change in the MPI due to a 1 degrees C rise in the SST is -6.7 hPa [-0.6 to 12.0 hPa], where a negative change indicates intensification and the estimated range in brackets reflects the uncertainty in the warming structure. The error of these MPI changes is estimated to be about 15%, assuming that the likely range of the RH parameter is 88 +/- 2%. The fractional change in the surface pressure drop is 3.6%, 8.4%, and 19%, in response to a 0.5, 0, and 2.0 degrees C rise, respectively, in SST, which is basically comparable to existing studies based on observations and numerical simulations. While TC intensification due to global warming tends to be greater for intense TCs at low latitudes, the tendencies at relatively high latitudes near the main islands of Japan suggest that TC development occurs in a broader region over a more prolonged season in a warmed environment.",1
"Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas, contributing 0.4-0.5 W m(-2) to global warming. Methane emissions originate from several sources, including wetlands, rice paddies, termites and ruminating animals. Previous measurements of methane flux from farm animals have been carried out on animals in unnatural conditions, in laboratory chambers or fitted with cumbersome masks. This study introduces eddy covariance measurements of CH4, using the newly developed LI-COR LI-7700 open-path methane analyser, to measure field-scale fluxes from sheep grazing freely on pasture. Under summer conditions, fluxes of methane in the morning averaged 30 nmol m (2) s (1), whereas those in the afternoon were above 100 nmol m(-2) s(-1), and were roughly two orders of magnitude larger than the small methane emissions from the soil. Methane emissions showed no clear relationship with air temperature or photo-synthetically active radiation, but some diurnal pattern was apparent, probably linked to sheep grazing behaviour and metabolism. Over the measurement period (days 60-277, year 2010), cumulative methane fluxes were 0.34 mol CH4 m(-2), equating to 134.3 g CO2 equivalents m(-2). By comparison, a carbon dioxide (CO2) sink of 819 g CO2 equivalents m(-2) was measured over the same period, but it is likely that much of this would be released back to the atmosphere during the winter or as off-site losses (through microbial and animal respiration). By dividing methane fluxes by the number of sheep in the field each day, we calculated CH4 emissions per head of livestock as 7.4 kg CH4 sheep(-1) yr(-1), close to the published IPCC emission factor of 8 kg CH4 sheep(-1) yr(-1).",1
"An inventory and monitoring program for species of non-volant small mammals was undertaken in Voyageurs National Park on the Minnesota-Canadian border. Other observations of mammals were made in and around the Park (1967-2004). Here we report species range extensions, most noted since 1982, for four species of rodents present in and/or around the Park and Superior National Forest. They are the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), rock vole (Microtus chrotorrhinus), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii) and eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). We also report the expansions within the state of the badger (Taxidea taxus) and the raccoon (Procyon lotor), previously known to occur further north in Canada. The results are discussed in the context of inventorying strategies, anthropogenic global climate change and the reservoirs for diseases transmissible to humans.",1
"To reduce human causes of global warming, large scale implementation of innovative products that save energy is necessary. Innovative products first reach the early market actors who are driven by a visionary attitude. Hereafter, the products must reach the much larger mainstream market whose actors are driven by a pragmatic attitude. Many innovations, however, only appeal to the visionary early market and do not meet the more pragmatic needs of the mainstream. For that reason, innovations often fall in a ""chasm"" between the early market and the mainstream and fail to reach the mainstream. We developed a strategy and a protocol to aid governmental agencies in influencing the mainstream members of housing associations to adopt energy conservation innovations. Our method is an adaptation of an existing marketing method and applicable to other target groups. The first step in crossing this chasm is to find a niche segment in the mainstream as the starting point for winning the rest of the mainstream. By surveying the target group and analyzing the data, we identified 29 housing associations (234 interviewed) that belong to this niche segment. Identifying the niche segment and its determinants of behaviour is part of our 4-step protocol that leads to adapting the innovative product to meet the needs of the niche and setting up a marketing plan to win the rest of the mainstream.

"The solar radiation dose in the oceanic upper mixed layer (SRD) has recently been identified as the main climatic force driving global dimethylsulfide (DMS) dynamics and seasonality. Because DMS is suggested to exert a cooling effect on the earth radiative budget through its involvement in the formation and optical properties of tropospheric clouds over the ocean, a positive relationship between DMS and the SRD supports the occurrence of a negative feedback between the oceanic biosphere and climate, as postulated 20 years ago. Such a natural feedback might partly counteract anthropogenic global warming through a shoaling of the mixed layer depth (MILD) and a consequent increase of the SRD and DMS concentrations and emission. By applying two globally derived DMS diagnostic models to global fields of MILD and chlorophyll simulated with an Ocean General Circulation Model coupled to a biogeochemistry model for a 50% increase of atmospheric CO2 and an unperturbed control run, we have estimated the response of the DMS-producing pelagic ocean to global warming. our results show a net global increase in surface DMS concentrations, especially in summer. This increase, however, is so weak (globally 2%) that it can hardly be relevant as compared with the radiative forcing of the increase of greenhouse gases. This contrasts with the seasonal variability of DMS (1000-2000% summer-to-winter ratio). We suggest that the ""plankton-DMS-clouds-earth albedo feedback"" hypothesis is less strong a long-term thermostatic system than a seasonal mechanism that contributes to regulate the solar radiation doses reaching the earth's biosphere.",1
"Manures and fertilizers are applied to agricultural lands in excess of recommended amounts, resulting in widespread pollution of surface and ground water and contributing a substantial source of greenhouse gases associated with global warming. By developing policies that exploit the value of farm produced nutrients, input costs can be minimized. Better accounting for or crediting of farm produced nutrients is leading to economically beneficial conservation of fertilizer. In addition, hog producers who own enough land may benefit from properly managing manure nutrients. Poultry litter is valuable as fertilizer and can be marketed by independent dealers to farmers in nutrient deficit areas, with very modest assistance from the government. Dairy producers may modify their past income support programs to finance central compost facilities. Although nutrient problems were neglected in the past, recent Federal initiatives and joint initiatives with states exploit many of these and other opportunities to avoid excessive application of nutrients to the land.",1
"It is very important to study eco-physiological processes of plants and to determine quantitative relations between accumulation, distribution of dry matter and environmental factors for regionalization, standardization and precision agriculture. Meanwhile, global changes, e.g., atmospheric CO2 concentration rising, global warming, and climate abnormity, have been effecting on agricultural productivity. This study provides a theoretical basis for predicting productive potentials and development trends in different agricultural regions. One-year-old black walnut (Juglans hindsii) seedlings were employed as subjects for setting up the dynamic models of dry matter accumulation and distribution, based on mechanistic models of photosynthesis, matter conservation and concentration gradient. Under optimum conditions of soil moisture and mineral nutrient, during the period of the canopy construction, the dry matter accumulation of the canopy conformed to logistic curves; but the accumulation of both total biomass and dry matter of stem-root could be divided into two phases: the first phase was exponential increase, the second was linear increase. The total biomass, dry matter of canopy and stem-root all presented a fluctuant increase, which was affected by the environmental factors. Ratio of daily increase of dry matter in the canopy and the steem-root (dW(l)/dW(s)) was changeable along with growth periods and environmental factors. At the initial stage of the canopy forming, dW(l)/dW(s) was larger, about 3.2 on average, which indicated that the photosynthetic product was mainly used to develop leaves; in the midterm, it was about 9, which indicated that the distribution of dry matter in the canopy and in the stem-root was relatively balanced; when the plant tended to stop growing, dW(l)/dW(s) decreased linearly, and the main distribution of dry matter moved to the roots.",1
"characteristics of tropical cyclones (TCs). The analysis has been performed using scenario climate simulations carried out with a fully coupled high-resolution global general circulation model. The capability of the model to reproduce a reasonably realistic TC climatology has been assessed by comparing the model results from a simulation of the twentieth century with observations. The model appears to be able to simulate tropical cyclone-like vortices with many features similar to the observed TCs. The simulated TC activity exhibits realistic geographical distribution, seasonal modulation, and interannual variability, suggesting that the model is able to reproduce the major basic mechanisms that link TC occurrence with large-scale circulation. The results from the climate scenarios reveal a substantial general reduction of TC frequency when the atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled and quadrupled. The reduction appears particularly evident for the tropical western North Pacific (WNP) and North Atlantic (ATL). In the NWP the weaker TC activity seems to be associated with reduced convective instabilities. In the ATL region the weaker TC activity seems to be due to both the increased stability of the atmosphere and a stronger vertical wind shear. Despite the generally reduced TC activity, there is evidence of increased rainfall associated with the simulated cyclones. Finally, the action of the TCs remains well confined to the tropical region and the peak of TC number remains equatorward of 20 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, notwithstanding the overall warming of the tropical upper ocean and the expansion poleward of warm SSTs.",1
"To estimate the changes in the integral fertility index of virgin soils in Mexico upon the expected global climate changes, we applied a method based on revealing the quantitative relationship between the Budyko radiation index of dryness and the modal values of the regional agrochemical properties of soils located on a nearly horizontal surface (with slope of less than 0.001) at elevations ranging from 0 to 2500 m a.s.l. The results of existing forecasts of the alteration of the global air temperature, radiation, and precipitation were also used. In the case that the carbon dioxide content is doubled in the atmosphere by the end of the 21st century, a medium and weak decrease in the soil fertility will be observed in the central (cereal) regions of Mexico; furthermore, a significant (over 20%) decrease in fertility will be observed in the tropical regions, where sugar cane is cultivated.",1
"It has been widely accepted worldwide that global warming is by far the greatest threat and challenge in the new millennium. In order to stop global warming and to promote sustainable development, renewable energy is a perfect solution to achieve both targets. Presently million hectares of land in Malaysia is occupied with oil palm plantation generating huge quantities of biomass. In this context, biomass from oil palm industries appears to be a very promising alternative as a source of raw materials including renewable energy in Malaysia. Thus, this paper aims to present current scenario of biomass in Malaysia covering issues on availability and sustainability of feedstock as well as current and possible utilization of oil palm biomass. This paper will also discuss feasibility of some biomass conversion technologies and some ongoing projects in Malaysia related to utilization of oil palm biomass as a source of renewable energy. Based on the findings presented, it is definitely clear that Malaysia has position herself in the right path to utilize biomass as a source of renewable energy and this can act as an example to other countries in the world that has huge biomass feedstock.

"In a model of ocean-atmosphere interaction that excluded biological processes, the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) was substantially reduced in scenarios involving global warming relative to control scenarios. The primary reason for the reduced uptake was the weakening or collapse of the ocean thermohaline circulation. Such a large reduction in this ocean uptake would have a major impact on the future growth rate of atmospheric CO2. Model simulations that include a simple representation of biological processes show a potentially large offsetting effect resulting from the downward flux of biogenic carbon. However, the magnitude of the offset is difficult to quantify with present knowledge.",1
"Observations indicate that greenhouse induced twentieth-century warming has been strongly modulated by variations in surface solar radiation. Between the 1950s and 1980s, declining surface solar radiation (""global dimming'') likely caused a dampening of global warming, whereas increasing surface solar radiation (""brightening'') may have contributed to the rapid warming in the last 2 decades, and possibly also in the first half of the twentieth century. This is also reflected in the decadal evolution of diurnal temperature range, which is highly correlated with surface solar radiation, and which shows a distinct transition from a strong decrease between the 1950s and 1980s, toward a leveling off thereafter. The present study investigates to what extent these effects are simulated in the latest generation of global climate models used in the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report (AR4) (phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) models). While these models reproduce the overall twentieth century warming over global land surfaces well, they underestimate the decadal variations in the warming and particularly also in diurnal temperature range, indicative of a lack of decadal variations in surface solar radiation in the models.",1
"We established it long-term field study in a sessile oak-turkey oak forest in Central Europe Hungary (Sikfokut Experimental Forest (SIK) to address how detrital quality and quantity control soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation and soil respiration. Due to the climate change the species composition of forest has been changing (Kotroczo et al., 2007), and the total leaf litter production has been slightly decreasing. According to our long-term litter manipulation field experiment, after a 5 year treating period, at the No Liner, No Root and No Input treatments the soil organic carbon, the soil pH, the soil enzyme activity (Fekete et al., 2007: Toth et al., 2007; Kotroczo et al., 2006) and soil respiration decreased. If the average soil temperature raise by 2 degrees C at the dry SIK site, the soil respiration would increase by 22.1%. The increasing soil respiration could speed Lip the global warming by positive feedback mechanism.",1
"Starting with a review of the basic processes that govern greenhouse warming, we have demonstrated that the hydrologic cycle plays a key role in the heat balance of the Earth's surface-atmosphere system. Through the water and other climatic feedbacks, the hydrologic cycle is shown to be a key factor in the climate's evolution as greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere. This paper examines the current predictive capability of general circulation models linked with macroscale and landscape-scale hydrologic models that simulate regional and local hydrologic regimes under global warming scenarios, Issues concerning hydrologic model calibration and validation in the context of climate change are addressed herein, It is shown that the natural uncertainty in hydrologic regimes in the present climate introduces a signal-to-noise interpretation problem for discerning greenhouse-induced variations in regional hydrologic regimes. Simulations of river basins by means of macroscale hydrologic models nested within general circulation models have been implemented in a few selected cases. From the perspective of water resources management, such simulations, carried out in detail under greenhouse-warming scenarios in midlatitudinal basins of the United States, predict shorter winter seasons, larger winter floods, drier and more frequent summer weather, and overall enhanced and protracted hydrologic variability. All these predictions point to potentially worsening conditions for flood control, water storage, and water supply in areas of semiarid midlatitudinal climates currently dependent of spring snowmelt. Little information of this type is currently available for other areas of the world. Practice of sound water resources engineering principles ought to be adequate to cope with additional hydrologic uncertainty that might arise from global warming.",1
"Mechanisms that determine the tropical precipitation anomalies under global warming are examined in an intermediate atmospheric model coupled with a simple land surface and a mixed layer ocean. To compensate for the warm tropospheric temperature, atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) moisture must increase to maintain positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) in convective regions. In nonconvective regions, ABL moisture is controlled by different balances and does not increase as much, creating a spatial gradient of ABL moisture anomalies. Associated with this spatial pattern of the ABL moisture anomalies are two main mechanisms responsible for the anomalous tropical precipitation. In the ""upped-ante mechanism,'' increases in ABL moisture are opposed by imported dry air wherever inflow from nonconvective regions over margins of convective regions occurs. The ABL moisture is not enough to meet the higher ""convective ante'' induced by the warmer tropospheric temperature, so precipitation is decreased. In the ""anomalous gross moist stability mechanism,'' gross moist stability is reduced due to increased ABL moisture. As a result, convection is enhanced and precipitation becomes heavier over convective regions. While the upped-ante mechanism induces negative precipitation anomalies over the margins of convective regions, the anomalous gross moist stability mechanism induces positive precipitation anomalies within convective regions. The importance of variation in gross moist stability, which is likely to differ among climate models, is suggested as a potential factor causing discrepancies in the predicted regional tropical precipitation changes.",1
"Burning fossil fuel in the North American continent contributes more to the CO2 global warming problem than in any other continent. The resulting climate changes are expected to alter food production. The overall changes in temperature, moisture, carbon dioxide, insect pests, plant pathogens, and weeds associated with global warming are projected to reduce food production in North America. However, in Africa, the projected slight rise in rainfall is encouraging, especially since Africa, already suffers from severe shortages of rainfall. For all regions, a reduction in fossil fuel burning is vital. Adoption of sound ecological resource management, especially soil and water conservation and the prevention of deforestation, is important. Together, these steps will benefit agriculture, the environment, farmers, and society as a whole.",1
"The road transportation system (including automobiles, buses and trucks) has not yet made significant use of modern electronics technologies to enhance system operations. Intelligent vehicle/highway systems (IVHS) is the label currently applied to the nascent attempts to use advanced technologies to enable travelers, vehicles and the roadway infrastructure to function as an integrated system. IVHS technologies influence both the supply and demand sides of transportation, to promote enhanced operational efficiency and reductions in vehicle miles traveled. These changes can reduce the contribution of the transportation sector to global warming in ways that are explained qualitatively in the paper. Quantitative evaluation of the global-warming implications of IVHS must follow from further research on the technology and travelers' responses to it, and from development of the policy framework for IVHS implementation.",1
"Theoretical analysis of a solar energy-powered Rankine thermodynamic cycle utilizing an innovative new concept, which uses supercritical carbon dioxide as a working fluid, is presented. In this system, a truly 'natural' working fluid, carbon dioxide, is utilized to generate firstly electricity power and secondly high-grade heat power and low-grade heat power. The uniqueness of the system is in the way in which both solar energy and carbon dioxide, available in abundant quantities in all parts of the world, are simultaneously used to build up a thermodynamic cycle and has the potential to reduce energy shortage and greatly reduce carbon dioxide emissions and global warming, offering environmental and personal safety simultaneously. The system consists of an evacuated solar collector system, a power-generating turbine, a high-grade heat recovery system, a low-grade heat recovery system and a feed pump. The performances of this CO2-based Rankine cycle were theoretically investigated and the effects of various design conditions, namely, solar radiation, solar collector area and CO2 flow rate, were studied. Numerical simulations show that the proposed system may have electricity power efficiency and heat power efficiency as high as 14% and 36.2%, respectively. It is also found that the cycle performances strongly depend on climate conditions. Also the electricity power and heat power outputs increase with the collector area and CO2 flow rate. The estimated COPpower and COPheat increase with the CO, flow rate, but decrease with the collector area. The CO2-based cycle can be optimized to provide maximum power, maximum heat recovery or a combination of both. The results suggest the potential of this new concept for applications to electricity power and heat power generation.",1
"This paper assesses potential changes in the distributions of 12 endemic rainforest vertebrates of the Wet Tropics of Northeastern Australia in response to global warming predictions. It is based on projecting models of current geographic distribution to modelled future conditions taken from regional climate models. In comparing vertebrate species with different mobility, adaptation potential and distribution, consequences of global warming for elements of the regional biodiversity were investigated. The bioclimatic program. BIOCLIM, was used to determine the current climatic ranges and the potential changes in the distributions of the 12 species Linder four climate change scenarios for the year 2100. Results suggest that even species with currently wide climatic ranges may become vulnerable. Species distribution area decreased by more than 50% on average. Furthermore, the remaining predicted range decreased from an average of 90% under a conservative scenario, to about 40% under a less conservative scenario.

"This study assesses the possible impact of climatic change on Saudi Arabia's agriculture and water supplies using climatic change scenarios from GCMs (General Circulation Models) and related research. The resulting assessment indicates that an increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation could have a major negative impact on agriculture and water supplies in Saudi Arabia. To find signs of climatic change in Saudi Arabia a preliminary assessment of systematic changes in temperature and precipitation was made, based on the records of four Saudi weather stations. The analysis of this data, which dates back to 1961, shows no discernable signs of climatic change during the study period. Such data is, however, limited both spatially and temporally and cannot provide conclusive evidence to confirm climatic changes projected by GCMs. Nevertheless, in the light of recent climatic conditions and rapid population growth, Saudi decision-makers are urged to adopt a 'no regret' policy. Ideally, such a policy would include measures to avoid future environmental or socioeconomic problems that may occur in the event of significant climatic change.",1
"Global warming is one of the most serious challenges facing humankind as it has the potential to dramatically modify the living conditions of future generations. In order to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, most countries are implementing regulations aimed at reducing their dependence on fossil fuels, promoting energy efficiency practices and favoring the deployment of low carbon energy technologies, including renewable energy sources. In line with the international commitments assumed as a member of the European Union (EU) and also as a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, Spain developed a National Plan for Renewable Energies (PER 2005-2010) that forms the basis of the national strategy in this field. Spain has often been cited as an example for the rapid growth in the use of low carbon energy technologies. However, despite significant progress in the last decade, Spain is far from meeting the national objectives set in PER primarily due to slow growth in the demand for biofuels and the limited success of biomass fired power plants. The evolution in other energy technologies has been faster, situating Spain as world a leader in solar and wind energy. However, the contribution of these technologies to the national consumption is very marginal. In the midst of intense regulatory, commercial and R&D activity, this paper analyses the current situation with respect to the production of renewable energies in Spain, focusing primarily on the use of biomass resources. The paper offers a general view of policy and regulatory background, illustrates current progress towards meeting national objectives and provides a brief description of representative projects and market activity in biofuel production and biomass valorization.",1
"How to compare the environmental damage caused by vehicles with different fuels and drive trains? This paper describes a methodology to assess the environmental impact of vehicles, using different approaches, and evaluating their benefits and limitations. Rating systems are analysed as tools to compare the environmental impact of vehicles, allowing decision makers to dedicate their financial and non-financial policies and support measures in function of the ecological damage. The paper is based on the ""Clean Vehicles"" research project, commissioned by the Brussels Capital Region via the BIM-IBGE (Brussels Institute for the Conservation of the Environment) (Van Mierlo et al., 2001). The Vrije Universiteit Brussel (ETEC) and the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (CEESE) have jointly carried out the workprogramme. The most important results of this project are illustrated in this paper. First an overview of environmental, economical and technical characteristics of the different alternative fuels and drive trains is given. Afterward the basic principles to identify the environmental impact of cars are described. An outline of the considered emissions and their environmental impact leads to the definition of the calculation method, named Ecoscore. A rather simple and pragmatic approach would be stating that all alternative fuelled vehicles (LPG, CNG, EV, HEV, etc.) can be considered as 'clean'. Another basic approach is considering as 'clean' all vehicles satisfying a stringent emission regulation like EURO IV or EEV. Such approaches however don't tell anything about the real environmental damage of the vehicles. In the paper we describe ""how should the environmental impact of vehicles be defined?"", including parameters affecting the emissions of vehicles and their influence on human beings and on the environment and ""how could it be defined ?"", taking into account the availability of accurate and reliable data. We take into account different damages (acid rain, photochemical air pollution, global warming, noise, etc.) and their impacts on several receptors like human beings (e.g.: cancer, respiratory diseases, etc); ecosystems, or buildings. The presented methodology is based on a kind of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in which the contribution of all emissions to a certain damage are considered (e.g. using Exposure-Response damage function). The emissions will include oil extraction, transportation refinery, electricity production, distribution, (Well-to-Wheel approach), as well as the emission due to the production, use and dismantling of the vehicle (Cradle-to-Grave approach). The different damages will be normalized to be able to make a comparison. Hence a reference value (determined by the reference vehicle chosen) will be defined as a target value (the normalized value will thus measure a kind of Distance to Target). The contribution of the different normalized damages to a single value ""EcoScore"" will be based on a panel weighting method. Some examples of the calculation of the Ecoscore for different alternative fuels and drive trains will be calculated as an illustration of the methodology.",1
"A low-order physical-biogeochemical climate model was used to project atmospheric carbon dioxide and global warming for scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The North Atlantic thermohaline circulation weakens in all global warming simulations and collapses at high levels of carbon dioxide. Projected changes in the marine carbon cycle have a modest impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide. Compared with the control, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 4 percent at year 2100 and 20 percent at year 2500. The reduction in ocean carbon uptake can be mainly explained by sea surface warming. The projected changes of the marine biological cycle compensate the reduction in downward mixing of anthropogenic carbon, except when the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation collapses.",1
"Many aspects of the calculation of the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the costs and benefits of possible response options are highly sensitive to the way in which time preference is incorporated into the computations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) used global warming potentials (GWPs) to standardize inputs of different gases with differing radiative forcings and atmospheric lifetimes; in the results emphasized by the IPCC's Second Assessment Report, a 100-year time horizon and no discounting is used, and this has been adopted by the Kyoto Protocol for use in the first commitment period (2008-2012). Here an alternative unified index is proposed that assigns explicit weights to the interests of different generations. In contrast to discounting (including the zero discount rate used by the IPCC), the generationally weighted index forces policy makers to face the moral assumptions that underlie their choices related to global warming.

"Asia's global warming potential (GWP) is large and growing. Asia releases an estimated 8.4 billion metric tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) each year from fossil fuel use, cement manufactures and ''land use changes'' while its anthropogenic emissions of methane (emissions derived primarily from wet rice cultivation and livestock - estimates from these being highly unreliable) represent nearly half the global total. These greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent 30% (28.3 billion metric tons) of the global total of CO2 equivalent emitted in 1989, Per capita GHG emissions are low but per-unit GDP emissions are very high (anywhere from two to six times more than in the OECD countries). The countries participating in the Asia Least Cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategies (ALGAS)(1) project account for nearly 70% of the total CO2 emissions and over 80% of the methane emissions in the entire Asian region. This paper highlights several key issues that must be considered while developing GHG emissions mitigation options within the context of an overall strategy of moving countries rapidly along a path of sustainable development that increases inter-sectoral energy efficiencies within the economy, enhance sinks, and decrease GHG emissions per capita. In particular, this integrated strategy should promote ''no regrets'' policies and emphasize ''win-win'' options that result in sustainable economic development over and above any GHG abatement benefits that might result from the adoption of such initiatives. This emphasis on long term economic sustainability requires a detailed economic evaluation of environmental impacts of potential ALGAS projects. The GHG emissions mitigation potential of the candidate projects must be evaluated within this overall framework of evaluating anticipated economic and environmental impacts. Part 1 of this paper highlights key issues in economic evaluation of environmental impacts and provides recommendations on how to use accepted evaluation techniques during strategic planning and project economic analysis. Project economic analysis incorporates the economic evaluation of environmental impacts. One important set of environmental impacts is that on global climate change through the candidate project's net impacts on GHG emissions. To assess the relative significance of climate change impacts of potential projects, a systematic screening exercise should be adopted during the strategic planning stage. This screening mechanism would allow a comparison of specific climate change impacts relative to other environmental impacts. A monetization of such impacts would then allow an objective assessment of the candidate project's role in mitigation of the impacts of GHG emissions. The special concerns related to development of strategies based on technical estimates and projections of economic parameters that are highly uncertain, are enumerated in Part  In addition to recognizing specific economic and political considerations while developing such strategies, the importance of private sector participation in pursuing options for abatement of GHG emissions must be acknowledged. Thus, several private sector specific issues must be factored into overall strategy development; these are discussed in Part 2.",1
"Let there be a positive (exogenous) probability that, at each date, the human species will disappear. We postulate an Ethical Observer (EO) who maximizes intertemporal welfare under this uncertainty, with expected-utility preferences. Various social welfare criteria entail alternative von Neumann Morgenstern utility functions for the EO: utilitarian, Rawlsian, and an extension of the latter that corrects for the size of population. Our analysis covers, first, a cake-eating economy (without production), where the utilitarian and Rawlsian recommend the same allocation. Second, a productive economy with education and capital, where it turns out that the recommendations of the two Eos are in general different. But when the utilitarian program diverges, then we prove it is optimal for the extended Rawlsian to ignore the uncertainty concerning the possible disappearance of the human species in the future. We conclude by discussing the implications for intergenerational welfare maximization in the presence of global warming. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Stratospheric water vapor abundance affects ozone, surface climate, and stratospheric temperatures. From 30-50 km altitude, temperatures show global decreases of 3-6 It over recent decades. These may be a proxy for water vapor increases, as the GISS climate model reproduces these trends only when stratospheric water vapor is allowed to increase. Observations suggest that stratospheric water vapor is indeed increasing, though measurements are extremely limited in either spatial coverage or duration. Model results suggest that the observed changes may be part of a global, long-term trend. Furthermore, the required water vapor change cannot be accounted for by increased stratospheric production, suggesting that climate change may be altering tropospheric input. The calculated water vapor increase contributes an additional approximate to 24% (approximate to0.2 W/m(2)) to the global warming from well-mixed greenhouse gases over the past two decades. Observed ozone depletion is also better reproduced when destruction due to increased water vapor is included. If the trend continues, it could increase future global warming and impede stratospheric ozone recovery.",1
"Arrhenius' 1896 model of the influence of carbonic acid (CO2) in the air on the temperature on the ground arose from debates concerning the causes of the Ice Ages in the Stockholm Physics Society. The calculation of the absorption-coefficients of H2O and CO2, which were the key to the construction of the model, was made possible through Arrhenius's use of Samuel P. Langley's measurements of heat emission in the lunar spectrum. The model enabled Arrhenius to show variations in mean temperature in sectors from 70 degrees N to 60 degrees S during four different seasons given five different levels of CO2. The immediate reactions to the model concerned the question which Arrhenius had attempted to answer, i.e., the causes of the Ice Ages. Since the 1970s Arrhenius's work has received much wider attention due to the concern with global warming resulting from the burning of fossil fuels.",1
"The frequency and character of Southern California's Santa Ana wind events are investigated within a 12-km-resolution downscaling of late-20th and mid-21st century time periods of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model global climate change scenario run. The number of Santa Ana days per winter season is approximately 20% fewer in the mid 21st century compared to the late 20th century. Since the only systematic and sustained difference between these two periods is the level of anthropogenic forcing, this effect is anthropogenic in origin. In both time periods, Santa Ana winds are partly katabatically-driven by a temperature difference between the cold wintertime air pooling in the desert against coastal mountains and the adjacent warm air over the ocean. However, this katabatic mechanism is significantly weaker during the mid 21st century time period. This occurs because of the well-documented differential warming associated with transient climate change, with more warming in the desert interior than over the ocean. Thus the mechanism responsible for the decrease in Santa Ana frequency originates from a well-known aspect of the climate response to increasing greenhouse gases, but cannot be understood or simulated without mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. In addition to the change in Santa Ana frequency, we investigate changes during Santa Anas in two other meteorological variables known to be relevant to fire weather conditions-relative humidity and temperature. We find a decrease in the relative humidity and an increase in temperature. Both these changes would favor fire. A fire behavior model accounting for changes in wind, temperature, and relative humidity simultaneously is necessary to draw firm conclusions about future fire risk and growth associated with Santa Ana events. While our results are somewhat limited by a relatively small sample size, they illustrate an observed and explainable regional change in climate due to plausible mesoscale processes.",1
" The anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere will probably induce important modifications of the global circulation in the atmosphere and ocean. Due to the angular momentum conservation of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system, variation of the length-of-day (LOD) can be expected. By using the outputs of the models participating to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP-2), we reach the following conclusions: (1) the models globally agree to an increase of the LOD of the order of 1 m mus/year, (2) the effect is mostly associated with an increase of the mean zonal wind, of which about one third is compensated by a change in mass repartition.",1
"By using life cycle assessment (LCA) modeling, this paper compares the environmental performance of six landfilling technologies (open dump, conventional landfill with flares, conventional landfill with energy recovery, standard bioreactor landfill, flushing bioreactor landfill and semi-aerobic landfill) and assesses the influence of the active operations practiced on these performances. The environmental assessments have been performed by means of the LCA-based tool EASEWASTE, whereby the functional unit utilized for the LCA is ""landfilling of I ton of wet household waste in a 10 on deep landfill for 100 years"". The assessment criteria include standard categories (global warming, nutrient enrichment, ozone depletion, photo-chemical ozone formation and acidification), toxicity-related categories (human toxicity and ecotoxicity) and impact on spoiled groundwater resources. Results demonstrate that it is crucially important to ensure the highest collection efficiency of landfill gas and leachate since a poor capture compromises the overall environmental performance. Once gas and leachate are collected and treated, the potential impacts in the standard environmental categories and on spoiled groundwater resources significantly decrease, although at the same time specific emissions from gas treatment lead to increased impact potentials in the toxicity-related categories. Gas utilization for energy recovery leads to saved emissions and avoided impact potentials in several environmental categories. Measures should be taken to prevent leachate infiltration to groundwater and it is essential to collect and treat the generated leachate. The bioreactor technologies recirculate the collected leachate to enhance the waste degradation process. This allows the gas collection period to be reduced from 40 to 15 years, although it does not lead to noticeable environmental benefits when considering a 100 years LCA-perspective. In order to more comprehensively understand the influence of the active operations (i.e., leachate recirculation, waste flushing and air injection) on the environmental performance, the time horizon of the assessment has been split into two time periods: years 0-15 and 16-100. Results show that if these operations are combined with gas utilization and leachate treatment, they are able to shorten the time frame that emissions lead to environmental impacts of concerti.

"Amphibians are an important and imperiled component of biodiversity. In this study we analyze the efficacy of Italian reserve network for protecting multiple amphibian species in a climate change scenario, considering both nationally designated areas and Natura 2000 sites. Our approach is based on ensemble niche modeling estimate of potential range shift under two carbon emission scenarios (A1FI and B1) and two dispersal assumptions. The predicted distributions were used to perform gap and irreplaceability analyses. Our findings show that the current Italian reserve network incompletely represents current amphibian diversity and its geographic pattern. The combination of the nationally designated protected areas and the Natura 2000 sites improves current representation of amphibians, but conservation targets based on geographic range extent are achieved for only 40% of species. Under the future scenarios, Natura 2000 sites become a crucial component of the protected areas system. Nonetheless, we predict that climate change decreases for many species the amount of suitable range falling into reserves, regardless of our assumptions about dispersal. We identify some currently unprotected areas that have high irreplaceability scores for species conservation and that maintain their importance under all the future scenarios we considered. We recommend designation of new reserves in these areas to help guarantee long-term amphibian conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"World soils and terrestrial ecosystems have been a source of atmospheric abundance of CO2 ever since settled agriculture began about 10-13 millennia ago. The amount of CO2-C emitted into the atmosphere is estimated at 136 +/- 55 Pg from terrestrial ecosystems, of which emission from world soils is estimated at 78 +/- 12 Pg. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems decreases soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by 30-50% over 50-100 years in temperate regions, and 50-75% over 20-50 years in tropical climates. The projected global warming, with estimated increase in mean annual temperature of 4-6 degrees C by 2100, may have a profound impact on the total soil C pool and its dynamics. The SOC pool may increase due to increase in biomass production and accretion into the soil due to the so-called ""CO2 fertilization effect"", which may also enhance production of the root biomass. Increase in weathering of silicates due to increase in temperature, and that of the formation of secondary carbonates due to increase in partial pressure of CO2 in soil air may also increase the total C pool. In contrast, however, SOC pool may decrease because of: (i) increase in rate of respiration and mineralization, (ii) increase in losses by soil erosion, and (iii) decrease in protective effects of stable aggregates which encapsulate organic matter. Furthermore, the relative increase in temperature projected to be more in arctic and boreal regions, will render Cryosols under permafrost from a net sink to a net source of CO2 if and when permafrost thaws. Thus, SOC pool of world soils may decrease with increase in mean global temperature. In contrast, the biotic pool may increase primarily because of the CO2 fertilization effect. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization effect may be constrained by lack of essential nutrients (e.g., N, P) and water. The potential of SOC sequestration in agricultural soils of Europe is 70-190 Tg C yr(-1). This potential is realizable through adoption of recommended land use and management, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems including wetlands.",1
"This paper addresses the possible impacts of global climate change on low streamflows in the Midwest, both directly, through lower precipitation, and indirectly, by rendering irrigation profitable in areas where it has found little application in the past. In the analysis presented here, streamflow data are altered to represent the effect of climate change and stream-supplied irrigation, and then used to estimate new values for two low-flow criteria, the one- and seven-day-ten-year low flows ((7)Q(10) and (1)Q(10)) Under 20 climate change and irrigation scenarios. Additionally, the frequencies of violation of these two criteria, and multiple violations in a three-year period, are determined. Results show that the potential impact of the assumed climate change scenarios on low flow standards is substantial. A 25 percent decrease in mean precipitation results in a 63 percent reduction in design now, even in the absence of irrigation. With irrigation, the reduction can be as much as 100 percent. The frequency of single violations of low flow criteria is found to increase several fold with irrigation. The frequency of multiple violations of low flow criteria in a three-year period is sensitive to climate change, increasing from around 20 percent to nearly 100 percent as the climate change becomes more severe.",1
"Landfill methane (CH4) emissions have been cited as one of the anthropogenic gas releases that can and should be controlled to reduce global climate change. This article reviews recent research that identifies ways to enhance microbial consumption of the gas in the aerobic portion of a landfill cover. Use of these methods can augment CH4 emission reductions achieved by gas collection or provide a sole means to consume CH4 at small landfills that do not have active gas collection systems. Field studies indicate that high levels of CH4 removal can be achieved by optimizing natural soil microbial processes. Further, during biotic conversion, not all of the CH4 carbon is converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) gas and released to the atmosphere; some of it will be sequestered in microbial biomass. Because biotic covers can employ residuals from other municipal processes, financial benefits can also accrue from avoided costs for residuals disposal.",1
"The changes in the thermohaline circulation (THC) because of the increased COZ in the atmosphere play an important role in future climate regimes. In this article, a new climate model developed at the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology is used to study the variation in THC strength, the changes of North Atlantic deep-water (NADW) formation, and the regional responses of the THC in the North Atlantic to increasing atmospheric CO2. From 2000 to 2100, under increased CO, scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2), the strength of THC decreases by 4 Sv (106 m(3)/s), 5.1 Sv, and 5.2 Sv, respectively, equivalent to a reduction of 20 O, 25 %, and 25.1 % of the present THC strength. The analyses show that the oceanic deep convective activity significantly strengthens in the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) Seas owing to saltier (denser) upper oceans, whereas weakens in the Labrador Sea and in the south of the Denmark Strait region (SDSR) because of surface warming and freshening due to global warming. The saltiness of the GIN Seas is mainly caused by the increase of the saline North Atlantic inflow through the Faro-Bank (FB) Channel. Under the scenario AIB, the deep-water formation rate in the North Atlantic decreases from 16. 2 Sv to 12. 9 Sv with increasing CO2.",1
"The historical development of the civil nuclear power generation industry is examined in the light of the need to meet conflicting energy-supply and environmental pressures over recent decades. It is suggested that fission (thermal and fast) reactors will dominate the market up to the period 2010-2030, with fusion being relegated to the latter part of the twenty-first century. A number of issues affecting the use of nuclear electricity generation in Western Europe are considered including its cost, industrial strategy needs, and the public acceptability of nuclear power, The contribution of nuclear power stations to achieving CO2 targets aimed at relieving global warming is discussed in the context of alternative strategies for sustainable development, including renewable energy sources and energy-efficiency measures, Trends in the generation of nuclear electricity from fission reactors are finally considered in terms of the main geopolitical groupings that make up the world in the mid-1990s. Several recent, but somewhat conflicting, forecasts of the role of nuclear power in the fuel mix to about 2020 are reviewed. It is argued that the only major expansion in generating capacity will take place on the Asia-Pacific Rim and not in the developing countries generally. Nevertheless, the global nuclear industry overall will continue to be dominated by a small number of large nuclear electricity generating countries; principally the USA, France and Japan.

"The general reluctance of policy makers to include forests in discussions about global warming has changed with the development of C measures to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD). Mesoamerica presents a logical starting point to promote REDD due to the extent of its forest, and the relatively advanced state of its forest management institutions and policies. This paper reviews the prospects for REDD in Mesoamerica using PES and other instruments, with emphasis on the effectiveness of REDD measures at reducing emissions, and their efficiency and fairness. It Concludes that in spite of reduced deforestation in the region, the growth of payments to avoid deforestation will be the most important policy change related to REDD in the region in the coining years. However, the magnitude and impact of any payments must not be exaggerated and Should be set in context of the overall trends resulting from broader social and economic dynamics.",1
"Reforming of methane with carbon dioxide has recently received an increasing interest since it has significant environmental implications in view of the fact that both methane and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases which have significant contribution on the global warming problem. A series of Ni loading 5, 8 and 11% catalysts supported on gamma-Al(2)O(3) and MgO were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method Their catalytic properties for the dry reforming of methane were studied experimentally. The fresh and spent catalysts and deposited carbon were characterized by means of EDX, SEM, BET and TGA. The combined characterization and catalyst performance tests results reveal that Ni//gamma-Al(2)O(3) provide better catalytic activity than Ni/MgO. But lower stability is due to higher catalyst deactivation rate. Using the 5 wt % Ni/MgO catalyst, at 500 degrees C reaction temperature, the conversions of CH(4) and CO(2) were 12 and 18.4% respectively. While at 800 degrees C, the conversions of CH(4) and CO(2) were 87 and 98% respectively. On the other hand, when 5 wt %Ni /gamma-Al(2)O(3) catalyst was used, at 500 degrees C reaction temperature, the conversions of CH(4) and CO(2) were 15.8 and 24.3% respectively. While at 800 degrees C, the conversions of CH(4) and CO(2) were 91 and 92.5% respectively. Ni//gamma-Al(2)O(3) catalyst is found in sensitive to the amounts of the Ni loading. Alternatively, for all temperatures the Ni/MgO catalyst is improved by the increasing the amounts of Ni loading. Both supports demonstrated the formation of filamentous coke on the surface of the catalyst and formed carbon nanofibers seem almost identical.",1
"Methane (CH4) is produced by fermentation in the rumen of cattle. Methane may play a part in global warming scenarios. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is an important forage in the eastern United States. The toxic syndrome associated with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum (E+) can be mitigated with management strategies that improve forage quality of Ef tail fescue pastures and animal performance. The sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique was used to determine the effects of tall fescue pasture management on CH4 production in 1997-1998. Two steers (Bos taurus) on two pastures each of E+ tall fescue, of endophyte free (E-) tall fescue, of E+/E - (1:1 ratio), and of E+/ladino white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and four steers and four lactating cows with nursing calves grazing either unimproved (UP) or best management practices (BMP) pastures were used to collect eructated CH4 samples. Daily CH4 emissions were about 95 to 200 g d(-1) for steers and 150 to 240 g d(-1) for cows. Steers grazing E+/clover pastures emitted 20% less CH4 kg(-1) d(-1) than steers grazing E+, E-, or E+/E- in summer. Season and animal size were the major factors affecting CH4 emissions. This first estimation of CH4 emissions from free-roaming cattle grazing tail fescue pastures indicates that (i) improved forage management strategies have little effect on daily emissions per animal that are primarily a function of rumen size and intake, and Oil the amount of emission per unit of animal product is reduced when improved practices are implemented.",1
"Aim Greenhouse-induced warming and resulting shifts in climatic zones may exceed the migration capabilities of some species. We used fourteen combinations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) to investigate possible migration rates required under CO(2) -doubled climatic forcing. Location Global. Methods Migration distances were calculated between grid cells of future biome type x and nearest same-biome-type cells in the current climate. In 'base-case' calculations, we assumed that 2 x CO(2) climate forcing would occur in 100 years, we used ten biome types and we measured migration distances as straight-line distances ignoring water barriers and human development. In sensitivity analyses, we investigated different time periods of 2 x CO(2) climate forcing, more narrowly defined biomes and barriers because of water bodies and human development. Results In the base-case calculations, average migration rates varied significantly according to the GVM used (BIOME3 vs. MAPSS), the age of the GCM (older- vs. newer-generation GCMs), and whether or not GCMs included sulphate cooling or CO(2) fertilization effects. However, high migration rates (greater than or equal to 1000 m year(-1)) were relatively common in all models, consisting on average of 17% grid cells for BIOME3 and 21% for MAPSS. Migration rates were much higher in boreal and temperate biomes than in tropical biomes. Doubling of the time period of 2 x CO(2) forcing reduced these areas of high migration rates to c . 12% of grid cells for both BIOME3 and MAPSS. However, to obtain migration rates in the Boreal biome that were similar in magnitude to those observed for spruce when it followed the retreating North American Glacier, a radical increase in the period of warming was required, from 100 to >1000 years. A reduction in biome area by an order of magnitude increased migration rates by one to three orders of magnitude, depending on the GVM. Large water bodies and human development had regionally important effects in increasing migration rates. Main conclusions In conclusion, evidence from coupled GCMs and GVMs suggests that global warming may require migration rates much faster than those observed during post-glacial times and hence has the potential to reduce biodiversity by selecting for highly mobile and opportunistic species. Several poorly understood factors that are expected to influence the magnitude of any such reduction are discussed, including intrinsic migrational capabilities, barriers to migration, the role of outlier populations in increasing migration rates, the role of climate in setting range limits and variation in species range sizes.",1
"Tropical cyclone (TC) activity change due to global warming (GW) has been investigated using general circulation models. However, they involve uncertainty in treating the ensemble effects of deep convections. Here we sidestep such uncertainty by using a global cloud-system-resolving model (GCRM) and assess TC changes with a time-slice experiment for the present-day and future GW experiments spanning 5 months each. The results support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report; reduction in global frequency but increase in more intense TCs. Consistent with recent studies, frequency is reduced over the North Atlantic due to intensified vertical wind shear. Over the Pacific, frequency is almost unchanged and the genesis location shifts eastward under the prescribed El-Nino like sea surface temperature change. With the GCRM's advantage of representing mesoscale properties, we find that the cloud height becomes taller for more intense TCs and that this relationship is strengthened with GW.

"This paper describes the construction of a climate change scenario for a region representing the 'extended' Tropics - 30 degrees N to 30 degrees S - using a methodology that combines results from a simple climate model and a Global Climate Model (GCM) transient climate change experiment. The estimated date by which this climate change scenario might be realized ranges from as early as the end of the 2030s to as late as well into the 22nd century. The central estimate is for this scenario to describe the climate of the 2060s, which would represent a global warming rate of about 0.2 degrees C per decade, with associated atmospheric CO2 concentrations estimated to be about 560 ppmv, 55% higher than 1990 levels. The role of anthropogenic aerosols in offsetting part of this future global warming and altering the regional character of the changes has not been considered. The paper presents changes in mean temperature; mean rainfall; rainfall seasonality, variability, frequency, and intensity and soil moisture. These patterns of change derive from only one GCM climate change experiment; different experiments would yield different patterns for the same global warming. There is also some discussion about possible changes in tropical cyclone (TC) activity, although since TCs remain poorly modelled in GCMs, the full range of possibilities (from reduced activity, through no change, to increased activity) should be considered in any impact assessment.",1

The focus is on anthropogenic sources, assessing the state-of-the- art of quantifying emissions of Ammonia (NH3), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O), the different purposes for which inventories are compiled, and to which extent current inventories meet the needs of atmospheric dispersion modelling. The paper concludes with a discussion of uncertainties involved and a brief outlook on emerging trends in the three regions investigated is conducted. Key issues are substantial differences in the overall magnitude, but as well in the relative sectoral contribution of emissions in the inventories that have been assessed. While these can be explained by the use of different methodologies and underlying data (e.g. emission factors or activity rates), they may lead to quite different results when using the emission datasets to model ambient air quality or the deposition with atmospheric dispersion models. Hence, differences and uncertainties in emission inventories are not merely of academic interest, but can have direct policy implications when the development of policy actions is based on these model results. The level of uncertainty of emission estimates varies greatly between substances, regions and emission source sectors. This has implications for the direction of future research needs and indicates how existing gaps between modelled and measured concentration or deposition rates could be most efficiently addressed. The observed current trends in emissions display decreasing NOx emissions and only slight reductions for NH3 in both Europe and the US. However, in China projections indicate a steep increase of both.",1
"Only recently, within a few decades, have we realized that humanity significantly influences the global environment. In the early 1980s, atmospheric measurements confirmed basic concepts developed a decade earlier. These basic concepts showed that human activities were affecting the ozone layer. Later measurements and theoretical analyses have clearly connected observed changes in ozone to human-related increases of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere. As a result of prompt international policy agreements, the combined abundances of ozone-depleting compounds peaked in 1994 and ozone is already beginning a slow path to recovery. A much more difficult problem confronting humanity is the impact of increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on global climate. The processes that connect greenhouse gas emissions to climate are very complex. This complexity has limited our ability to make a definitive projection of future climate change. Nevertheless, the range of projected climate change shows that global warming has the potential to severely impact human welfare and our planet as a whole. This paper evaluates the state of the scientific understanding of the global change issues, their potential impacts, and the relationships of scientific understanding to policy considerations.

"The microclimate in facilities for studying effects of elevated CO2 on crops differs from ambient conditions. Open-top chambers (OTCs) increase temperature by 1-3 degrees C. If temperature and CO2 interact in their effect on crops, this would limit the value of OTC experiments. Furthermore, interaction of CO2 and temperature deserves study because increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration are expected to cause global warming. This paper describes two experiments in which a recently developed cooling system for OTCs was used to analyse the effects of temperature on photosynthesis, growth and yield of spring wheat (Triticum nestivum L., cv. Minaret). Two levels of CO2 were used (350 and 700 ppm), and two levels of temperature, with cooled OTCs being 6-2.4 degrees C colder than noncooled OTCs. Photosynthetic rates were increased by elevated CO2, but no effect of temperature was found. Cross-switching CO2 concentrations as well as determination of A-Ci curves showed that plant photosynthetic capacity after anthesis acclimated to elevated CO2. The acclimation may be related to the effects of CO2 on tissue composition: elevated CO2 decreased leaf nitrogen concentrations and increased sugar content. Calculations of the seasonal mean crop light-use efficiency (LUE) were consistent with the photosynthesis data in that CO2 increased LUE by 20% on average whereas temperature had no effect. Both elevating CO2 and cooling increased grain yield, by an average of 11% and 23%, respectively. CO2 and temperature stimulated yield via different mechanisms: CO2 increased photosynthetic rate, but decreased crop light interception capacity (LAI), whereas cooling increased grain yield by increasing LAI and extending the growing season with 10 days. The effects of CO2 and temperature were not additive: the CO2 effect was about doubled in the noncooled open-top chambers. In most cases, effects on yield were mediated through increased grain density rather than increased individual grain weights. The higher growth response to elevated CO2 in noncooled vs. cooled OTCs shows that a cooling system may remove a bias towards overestimating crop growth response to CO2 in open-top chambers.",1
"A conceptual model was developed to project the global warming for this century. This model incorporated several important factors associated with the climate and society. Under the forcing of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, the climate system is represented by a global mean surface air temperature (SAT) and carbon storage, which is separated into the atmosphere, land and oceans. The SAT rises due to the atmospheric carbon, which is partially absorbed by the terrestrial ecosystem and the ocean. These absorption rates are reduced by the rising SAT. The anthropogenic carbon dioxide is emitted by society, which is described by global energy production (P) and energy efficiency/carbon intensity (E), yielding a rate of P/E. P consists of the energy production per capita (H) and the population (M) in developed countries and regions, P = H 9 M. These society components were set to grow, based on the historical record from the last 50 years, while societal incentives to reduce the growth rate H and to increase E in proportion to the increase in SAT were introduced. It is shown that, among the basic scenarios in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) for this century, medium-level carbon emission-where the growth rate of H is reduced by 30% and E is doubled, with 1 degrees C of warming-could be achieved. Until the end of this century, both the terrestrial ecosystem and the oceans act as sinks. If societal incentives are eliminated, carbon emission approaches the upper limit considered in the SRES scenarios, and the terrestrial ecosystem changes into a source of carbon dioxide. Since H and E are closely related to lifestyle and technology, respectively, individuals in the developed countries are urged to change their lifestyles, and institutions need to develop low-carbon technologies and spread them to developing countries. When society achieves medium-level carbon emission for a couple of centuries, oceanic absorption was found to become more crucial than terrestrial absorption, so oceanic behavior has to be estimated more accurately.",1
"Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Currently, management approaches are being proposed that intend to (1) mitigate climate change by enhancing forest carbon stores and (2) foster adaptation by maintaining compositionally and structurally complex forests. However, little is known about the compatibility of these two objectives or the long-term efficacy of a given management regime at simultaneously achieving adaptation and mitigation. To address this need, we examined stand-level carbon and complexity responses using five long-term (> 50 yrs) silviculture experiments within the upper Great Lakes region, USA. In particular, live tree carbon stores and sequestration rates, and compositional and structural complexity were analyzed from three thinning experiments in Pinus resinosa and two selection method experiments in northern hardwood systems to elucidate the long-term effects of management on these ecosystem attributes and the general compatibility of mitigation and adaptation objectives. As expected, we observed a general increase in large tree densities with stand age and positive relationships between stand stocking level and live tree carbon stores. More importantly, our results clearly identify tradeoffs between the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives across each study. For example, maintaining higher stocking levels (i.e., enhanced mitigation by increasing carbon stores) resulted in decreases in stand-level structural and compositional complexity (i.e., reduced adaptation potential). In addition, rates of live tree carbon increment were also the lowest within the highest stocking levels; despite the benefits of these stand conditions to maximizing carbon stores. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of avoiding rigid adherence to a single objective, such as maximum on-site carbon stores, without recognizing potential consequences to other ecosystem components crucial to ensuring long-term ecosystem functioning within the context of environmental change. One potential stand-level strategy for balancing these goals may be to employ multi-aged management systems, such as irregular shelterwood and selection systems, that maintain a large proportion of carbon stores in retained mature trees while using thinning to create spatial heterogeneity that promotes higher sequestration rates in smaller, younger trees and simultaneously enhances structural and compositional complexity.

"There is a worldwide interest in renewable electricity technologies (RETs) due to growing concerns about global warming and climate change. As an EU candidate country whose energy demand increases exponentially, Turkey inevitably shares this common interest on RET. This study, using an aggregate economic equilibrium model, explores the economic costs of different policy measures to mitigate CO2 emissions in Turkey. The model combines energy demands, capital requirements and labor inputs at a constant elasticity of substitution under an economy-wide nested production function. Growing energy demand, triggered by economic growth, is met by increased supply and initiates new capacity additions. Investment into RET is encouraged via the incorporation of (a) endogenous technological learning through which the RET cost declines as a function of cumulative capacity, and (b) a willingness to pay (WTP) function which imposes the WTP of consumers as a lower bound on RET installation. The WTP equation is obtained as a function of consumer income categories, based on data gathered from a pilot survey in which the contingent valuation methodology was employed. The impacts of various emission reduction scenarios on GDP growth and RET diffusion are explored. As expected, RET penetration is accelerated under faster technological learning and higher WTP conditions. It is found that stabilizing CO2 emissions to year 2005 levels causes economic losses amounting to 17% and 23% of GDP in the years 2020 and 2030, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) influences global mean temperatures via counteracting effects: CO(2) emissions contribute to global warming, while biogeophysical effects, in particular the increase in surface albedo, often impose a cooling influence. Previous studies of idealized, large-scale deforestation found that albedo cooling dominates over CO(2) warming in boreal regions, indicating that boreal reforestation is not an effective mitigation tool. Here we show the importance of past land use decisions in influencing the mitigation potential of reforestation on these lands. In our simulations, CO(2) warming dominates over albedo cooling because past land use decisions resulted in the use of the most productive land with larger carbon stocks and less snow than on average. As a result past land use decisions extended CO(2) dominance to most agriculturally important regions in the world, suggesting that in most places reversion of past land cover change could contribute to climate change mitigation. While the relative magnitude of CO(2) and albedo effects remains uncertain, the historical land use pattern is found to be biased towards stronger CO(2) and weaker albedo effects as compared to idealized large-scale deforestation.

"The Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) similar to 55 Ma ago, corresponds to a time characterized by extreme global warming caused by a massive carbon input into the ocean and atmosphere. Climate proxies from sedimentary records suggest that fresh water flow from an ice-free Arctic into the remainder of the global ocean increased due to tectonic changes, enhanced runoff, and thermal expansion. In this study we use the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM-3), including a carbon cycle model, to examine the sensitivity of the ocean circulation to freshwater outflow from the Arctic Ocean during the PETM, and whether these changes may have contributed to an additional warming during the PETM. Two experiments, the first with freshwater exchange between the Arctic and Pacific Oceans and the second between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, are compared with a reference experiment with exchange between the Arctic and Indian Oceans and with independent stratigraphic and geochemical records from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP). As freshwater is transported from the Arctic into the North Pacific Ocean, stratification is enhanced in the North Pacific due to a significant reduction in surface salinity. As a consequence, intermediate to deep-water sources shift from both hemispheres in the Pacific Ocean to a dominant source in the South Pacific Ocean and an additional source in the northern Tethys Ocean. This simulated shift of deep-water sources during the PETM is in agreement with recent Nd isotope measurements. The circulation patterns in the Pacific are similar to those inferred from stable isotope reconstructions, but contradicting a strong North Atlantic deep-water source during the PETM. Freshwater input into the Pacific Ocean results in a warming of intermediate water masses of >2 degrees C in the North Pacific. When freshwater flow is routed from the Arctic into the Atlantic Ocean, surface density changes are too small to change vertical stratification substantially, contrary to a previous study. In summary, based upon circulation patterns and temperature increases due to freshwater flux through the Bering Strait, Arctic freshwater input into the North Pacific may have contributed to methane hydrate destabilization, an event suggested to have accelerated warming during the PETM.

"The existence of an ice cover has important effects on the streamflow conditions as well as on the hear transfer between water bodies and the overlying atmosphere, This paper investigates the effects of climate variability on the termination of the ice season in the Baltic region. In particular, trends and fluctuations observed in the cryophenological records from this region are analyzed in detail, searching for possible connections with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO seems to affect mostly the late-winter temperature (January-March) with a significant impact also on the mid-spring (April-May) period, when the air temperature is strongly correlated to the ice dates. A regional analysis shows the existence in the series of winter temperature (JFM) of the same fluctuations as the winter NAO. The same components can be found in the cryophenological records and (partly) in the series of spring temperature. Nevertheless, both ice phenology and spring temperature show the existence of a very well defined trend that is not detectable in the series of winter NAO at time scales of a century or longer, This leads to the conclusion that winter NAO has still a weak, though significant, effect on the regime of spring temperature in the Baltic region and explains the most significant fluctuating components embedded in the cryophenological records. However it is argued that other climatic forcings, related to CO2-induced regional and global warming, acting at the end of the ice season, are able to induce pronounced trends in the regime of spring temperature and have an important impact on the cryosphere leading to the earlier occurrence of ice break-up observed in the last several decades.

"The 1980s have seen an unprecedented growth in awareness of the problem of climatic change. The 1990s will be the critical decade during which collective concern must be turned into concerted action through global Climate Conventions and related Protocols. This article proposes such a strategy with the following elements: setting of a warming ceiling and a rate of change per decade; development of emission scenarios which come close to the set limits using climate modeling; allocation of emission shares by nation; assessment of emission reduction potential by gas, source, measure and nation; development of national emission reduction plans; agreement, implementation and supervision of such plans; establishment of a climate fund. This study addresses the first element of the strategy by making extensive use of model-based climate scenario analysis. The results of this analysis will help identify emission reduction measures which could limit the mean global surface warming to approximately 2 K in 2100 over the preindustrial level and restrict the average rate of global warming to about 0.1 K per decade. The effectiveness of these scenarios is assessed using a one dimensional (1-D) climate model from 1860 to 2100. The results of this research will help widen the scope for a more flexible climate protection policy.",1
"An improved version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model SEAPODYM was used to investigate the potential impacts of global warming on tuna populations. The model included an enhanced definition of habitat indices, movements, and accessibility of tuna predators to different vertically migrant and non-migrant micronekton functional groups. The simulations covered the Pacific basin (model domain) at a 2 degrees x 2 degrees geographic resolution. The structure of the model allows an evaluation from multiple data sources, and parameterization can be optimized by adjoint techniques and maximum likelihood using fishing data. A first such optimized parameterization was obtained for bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Pacific Ocean using historical catch data for the last 50 years and a hindcast from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model driven by the NCEP atmospheric reanalysis. The parameterization provided very plausible biological parameter values and a good fit to fishing data from the different fisheries, both within and outside the time period used for optimization. We then employed this model to forecast the future of bigeye tuna populations in the Pacific Ocean. The simulation was driven by the physical-biogeochemical fields predicted from a global marine biogeochemistry - climate simulation. This global simulation was performed with the IPSL climate model version 4 (IPSL-CM4) coupled to the oceanic biogeochemical model PISCES and forced by atmospheric CO2, from historical records over 1860-2000, and under the SRES A2 IPCC scenario for the 21st century (i.e. atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 850 ppm in the year 2100). Potential future changes in distribution and abundance under the IPCC scenario are presented but without taking into account any fishing effort. The simulation showed an improvement in bigeye tuna spawning habitat both in subtropical latitudes and in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) where the surface temperature becomes optimal for bigeye tuna spawning. The adult feeding habitat also improved in the ETP due to the increase of dissolved oxygen concentration in the sub-surface allowing adults to access deeper forage. Conversely, in the Western Central Pacific the temperature becomes too warm for bigeye tuna spawning. The decrease in spawning is compensated by an increase of larvae biomass in subtropical regions. However, natural mortality of older stages increased due to lower habitat values (too warm surface temperatures, decreasing oxygen concentration in the sub-surface and less food). This increased mortality and the displacement of surviving fish to the eastern region led to stable then declining adult biomass at the end of the century. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"The effects of making a 1000 ha organic farm self-sufficient in renewable fuel were studied. Biomass grown on-farm can be transported to large fuel production facilities and the fuel transported back to the farm. Two fuels, Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FTD) and dimethyl ether (I)ME), produced from either straw or short-rotation willow coppice (Salix), were studied. The environmental impact, land use and energy balance were calculated using life-cycle methodology. It was calculated that the straw-based systems had only 32-39% of the impact on global warming (kg [CO2-eq]) compared to the Salix-based systems. For acidification and eutrophication, the differences between the systems were less significant. The energy balances were 8.9 and 9.6 for FTD and 10.1 and 10.0 for DME, from straw and Salix, respectively. To become self-sufficient in FTD, 108 ha has to be set aside for Salix production or 261 ha of straw collected from the existing crop rotation. For DME the corresponding figures are 38 and 70 ha. The many by-products in the FTD scenarios explain the large difference between fuels. Comparing FTD and DME, the differences in environmental impact were small. Considering this, FTD is a more likely alternative since DME requires a pressurised infrastructure system and engine modifications. (c) 2007 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The assessment of uncertainties in global warming projections is often based on expert judgement, because a number of key variables in climate change are poorly quantified. In particular, the sensitivity of climate to changing greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere and the radiative forcing effects by aerosols are not well constrained, leading to large uncertainties in global warming simulations(1). Here we present a Monte Carlo approach to produce probabilistic climate projections, using a climate model of reduced complexity. The uncertainties in the input parameters and in the model itself are taken into account, and past observations of oceanic and atmospheric warming are used to constrain the range of realistic model responses. We obtain a probability density function for the present-day total radiative forcing, giving 4 to 2.4 W m(-2) for the 5-95 per cent confidence range, narrowing the global-mean indirect aerosol effect to the range of 0 to -2 W m(-2). Ensemble simulations for two illustrative emission scenarios suggest a 40 per cent probability that global-mean surface temperature increase will exceed the range predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), but only a 5 per cent probability that warming will fall below that range.",1
"The changes in the frequency of occurrence of extreme wind storm events in response to anthropogenic global warming are explored using a multi-model ensemble of coupled climate model simulations. These changes, diagnosed using several different metrics based on the daily wind fields, indicate that the frequency of the most extreme wind events decreases over the tropics in association with the model-projected weakening of the large-scale atmospheric circulation. At higher latitudes, the strongest near-surface wind events are found to increase in frequency in association with the amplified baroclinicity and poleward shift of the midlatitude storm tracks. The frequency of the heaviest precipitation events increases in all models, despite a systematic reduction of extreme upward vertical velocities, due to the increased moisture content of the lower troposphere. All of these changes are shown to be robust projections of current climate models. Citation: Gastineau, G., and B. J.

"The problem of global climate change forced by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and sulfur components (SU) has to be addressed by different methods, including the consideration of concurrent forcing mechanisms isms and the analysis of observations. This is due to the shortcoming and uncertainties of all methods, even in case of the most sophisticated ones. III respect to the global mean surface air temperature, we compare the results from multiple observational statistical models such as multiple regression (MRM) and neural networks (NNM) with those of energy balance (EBM) and general circulation models (GCM) where, in the latter case, we refer to the recent IPCC Report. Our statistical assessments, based on the 1866-1994 period, lead to a GHG signal of 0.8-3 K and a combined GHG-SU signal of 0.5-0.8 K detectable in observations. This is close to GCM simulations and clearly larger than the volcanic, solar and ENSO (El Nino/southern oscillation) signals also considered.",1
"The Mekong River Basin is a key regional resource in Southeast Asia for sectors that include agriculture, fisheries and electricity production. Here we explore the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources within the river basin. We quantify uncertainty in these projections associated with GCM structure and climate sensitivity, as well as from hydrological model parameter specification. This is achieved by running pattern-scaled GCM scenarios through a semi-distributed hydrological model (SLURP) of the basin. Pattern-scaling allows investigation of specific thresholds of global climate change including the postulated 2 degrees C threshold of ""dangerous"" climate change. Impacts of a 2 degrees C rise in global mean temperature are investigated using seven different GCMs, providing an implicit analysis of uncertainty associated with GCM structure. Analysis of progressive changes in global mean temperature from 0.5 to 6 degrees C above the 1961-1990 baseline (using the HadCM3 GCM) reveals a relatively small but non-linear response of annual river discharge to increasing global mean temperature, ranging from a 5.4% decrease to 4.5% increase. Changes in mean monthly river discharge are greater (from -16% to +55%, with greatest decreases in July and August, greatest increases in May and June) and result from complex and contrasting intra-basin changes in precipitation, evaporation and snow storage/melt. Whilst overall results are highly GCM dependent (in both direction and magnitude), this uncertainty is primarily driven by differences in GCM projections of future precipitation. In contrast, there is strong consistency between GCMs in terms of both increased potential evapotranspiration and a shift to an earlier and less substantial snowmelt season. Indeed, in the upper Mekong (Lancang sub-basin), the temperature-related signal in discharge is strong enough to overwhelm the precipitation-related uncertainty in the direction of change in discharge, with scenarios from all GCMs leading to increased river flow from April-June and decreased flow from July-August.",1
"Global climate change urges immediate measures to be taken to limit greenhouse gas emission coming from the fossil fuel fired power plants. Solar thermal energy can be involved in different ways in existing power generation plants in order to replace heat produced by fossil fuels. Solar field feed water preheating is mainly discussed in this paper as an option for fast and feasible RES penetration. Rankine regenerative steam cycled power plant has been modelled with Thermoflow software. The plant model incorporates also a field with solar Fresnel collectors that directly heats boiler's feed water. The proposed plant modification yields substantial fossil fuel input reduction. The best results can be obtained when the group of high pressure heaters is replaced and feed water temperature exceeds its original design value. The solar power generation share can reach up to 23% of the power plant capacity in this case, having efficiency higher than 39% for the best solar hour of the year. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"The costs of greenhouse gas emission reduction with abatement of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are investigated using the FUND model. The central policy scenario keeps anthropogenic radiative forcing below 4.5 Wm(2). If CO2 emission reduction were the only possibility to meet this target, the net present value of consumption losses would be $45 trillion; with abatement of the other gases added, costs fall to $33 trillion. The bulk of these costs savings can be ascribed to reductions of nitrous oxide. Because nitrous oxide emission reduction is so much more important than methane emission reduction, the choice of equivalence metric between the greenhouse gases does not matter much. Sensitivity analyses show that the shape of the cost curves for CH4 and N2O emission reductions matter, and that the inclusion of sulphate aerosols makes policy targets substantially harder to achieve. The costs of emission reduction vary greatly with the choice of stabilisation target. A target of 4.5 Wm-2 is not justified by our current knowledge of the damage costs of climate change.",1
"Impact of sea-surface warming upon the fish assemblages of the Portuguese coast was assessed under two scenarios, the A2 and the B2 scenarios (Special Report on Emission Scenarios), which when coupled with a regional circulation model HadRM3 predict 1 and 2A degrees C of sea-surface warming until the year 2100. Species richness increased in the Portuguese coast. In both scenarios, there was a latitudinal gradient in the amount of lost and gained species, increasing from north to south. An anomaly in the latitudinal gradient of species richness was detected in the southernmost area, which presented the lowest species richness of all areas, in the A2 scenario, and appears to be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Very few species were totally eliminated from Portuguese waters. For the Portuguese coast as a whole, there were more new than lost species, in both scenarios. Most of the new species were commercially important species, in the majority subtropical in the north and tropical in the south, mainly demersal and reef-associated. Reef-associated species also increased in relative importance. A commercial opportunity for fisheries may arise from climate warming, since most of the new species were commercial species and not many commercial species were lost. An increasing gradient from north to south was detected in the colonization of new species of herbivores, planktivores, and omnivores, as well as lower mean trophic level, which might have consequences for the future of trophic webs.",1
"I evaluated long-term changes in hydrological conditions (temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen) in Korean sea waters in relation to the regional land climate change (air temperature and precipitation) based on available meteorological and oceanographic data. Regression analyses, spatial patterns and cross-correlations on the climatologic and hydrological factors suggested that industrialization processes and related urban heat-island effects during the past 37 years from 1968 to 2005 in South Korea have increased land surface temperatures by 267 degrees C, at least for the urban areas, and subsequently increased sea surface temperatures by 0.975 degrees C and decreased salinities by 0.229. The influence of land surface temperature on the sea water temperature reached at least 75-m depth. Regarding the causality in the land-ocean climate changes, air-temperature changes preceded sea water temperature change by 0-2 months in spring and summer, but the sequence could be reversed, possibly because of potential heat held by the ocean. This study demonstrated that human factors have been driving warning influences on regional sea waters, impacting marine ecosystems and changing dominant fish species in commercial fishery catches of Korea.",1
"Historically, local, state and federal policies have separately promoted the generation of electricity from renewable technologies and the pursuit of energy efficiency to help mitigate the detrimental effects of global climate change and foster energy independence. Federal policymakers are currently considering and several states have enacted a combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard which proponents argue provides a comprehensive approach with greater flexibility and at lower cost. We examine the financial impacts on various stakeholders from alternative compliance strategies with a Combined Efficiency and Renewable Electricity Standard (CERES) using a case study approach for utilities in Kansas. Our results suggest that an investor-owned utility is likely to pursue the most lucrative compliance strategy for its shareholders-one that under-invests in energy efficiency resources. If a business model for energy efficiency inclusive of both a lost fixed cost recovery mechanism and a shareholder incentive mechanism is implemented, our analysis indicates that an investor-owned utility would be more willing to pursue energy efficiency as a lower-cost CERES compliance strategy. Absent implementing such a regulatory mechanism, separate energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standards would improve the likelihood of reducing reliance on fossil fuels at least-cost through the increased pursuit of energy efficiency.

"A series of model experiments were conducted using an intermediate ocean atmosphere land model for a better understanding of a distinct land sea asymmetry in tropical precipitation differences between the mid-Holocene and preindustrial climates. In austral (boreal) summer, most reduced (enhanced) precipitation occurs over continental convective regions, while most enhanced (reduced) precipitation occurs over oceanic convection zones. This land sea asymmetry of tropical precipitation is particularly clear in austral summer. During the mid-Holocene, the solar forcing presents both spatial and seasonal asymmetric patterns. While the boreal summer insolation is stronger at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in the mid-Holocene than at present, the austral summer insolation is weaker with a more spatially symmetric distribution about the equator. Because of the slow response time of the ocean to forcing, the direct insolation forcing of the current season is cancelled by the ocean memory of an earlier insolation forcing, which in the case of the mid-Holocene is opposite to the current season insolation forcing. As a result, tropical sea surface temperature variation, as well as the tropical atmospheric temperature and moisture changes, is small, which gives rise to a different precipitation response from under the condition of stronger atmospheric temperature and moisture changes, such as in the case of postindustrial global warming induced by an increased concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Thus, the cancellation between the direct and memory effects of the seasonally asymmetric insolation forcing leaves the net energy into the atmosphere to be responsible for the land sea asymmetry of tropical precipitation changes.",1
"Agricultural production plays an important role in affecting atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Field measurements were conducted in Quzhou County, Hebei Province in the North China Plains to quantify carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions from a winter wheat-maize rotation field, a common cropping system across the Chinese agricultural regions. The observed flux data in conj. unction with the local climate, soil and management information were utilized to test a process-based model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, for its applicability for the cropping system. The validated DNDC was then used for predicting impacts of three management alternatives (i.e., no-till, increased crop residue incorporation and reduced fertilizer application rate) on CO(2) and N(2)O emissions from the target field. Results from the simulations indicated that (1) CO(2) emissions were significantly affected by temperature, initial SOC, tillage method, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soils; (2) increases in temperature, initial SOC, total fertilizer N input, and manure amendment substantially increased N(2)O emissions; and (3) temperature, initial SOC, tillage, and quantity and quality of the organic matter added in the soil all had significant effects on global warming. Finally, five 50-year scenarios were simulated with DNDC to predict their long-term impacts on crop yield, soil C dynamics, nitrate leaching losses, and N(2)O emissions. The modelled results suggested that implementation of manure amendment or crop residue incorporation instead of increased fertilizer application rates would more efficiently mitigate GHG emissions from the tested agro-ecosystem. The multi-impacts provided a Sound basis for comprehensive assessments on the management alternatives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"A basin-wide warming in the North Atlantic Ocean has occurred since the mid-1990s; however, the cause of this basin-wide warming is controversial. Some studies argued that the warming is due to global warming in association with the secular increase of the atmospheric greenhouse gas of carbon dioxide (CO2), while others suggested that it is caused by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) - an oscillatory mode occurring in North Atlantic sea surface temperature. Here we show that both global warming and AMO variability make a contribution to the recent basin wide warming in the North Atlantic and their relative contribution is approximately equal. It is further shown that after removing a linear trend and the seasonal cycle, atmospheric CO2 measured from 1958-2008 varies approximately with the AMO. On the assumption that a linear trend can be removed from the CO2 time series, then there are suggestive similarities between CO2 and AMO temperature anomalies. That is, atmospheric CO2 increases (decreases) when the AMO is in the warm (cold) phase. This would suggest that the recent basin-wide warming of the North Atlantic might contribute to global ocean warming via its associated increase of atmospheric CO2. Citation: Wang, C., and S. Dong (2010), Is the basin-wide warming in the North Atlantic Ocean related to atmospheric carbon dioxide and global warming?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 37, L08707, doi: 10.1029/2010GL042743.",1
"The Great Plains landscape is less topographically complex than most other regions within North America, but diverse aquatic ecosystems, such as playas, pothole lakes, ox-bow lakes, springs, groundwater aquifers, intermittent and ephemeral streams, as well as large rivers and wetlands, are highly dynamic and responsive to extreme climatic fluctuations. We review the evidence for climatic change that demonstrates the historical importance of extremes in north-south differences in summer temperatures and east-west differences in aridity across four large subregions. These physical driving forces alter density stratification, deoxygenation, decomposition and salinity. Biotic community composition and associated ecosystem processes of productivity and nutrient cycling respond rapidly to these climatically driven dynamics. Ecosystem processes also respond to cultural effects such as dams and diversions of water for irrigation, waste dilution and urban demands for drinking water and industrial uses. Distinguishing climatic from cultural effects in future models of aquatic ecosystem functioning will require more refinement in both climatic and economic forecasting. There is a need, for example, to predict how long-term climatic forecasts (based on both ENSO and global warming simulations) relate to the permanence and productivity of shallow water ecosystems. Aquatic ecologists, hydrologists, climatologists and geographers have much to discuss regarding the synthesis of available data and the design of future interdisciplinary research.

"The authors investigate the change of atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) in long, transient, coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulations with increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration and sulfate aerosol loading. A significant increase of global AAM, on the order of 4 x 10(25) kg m(2) s(-1) for 3 x CO2-1 x CO2, was simulated by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) coupled model. The increase was mainly contributed by the relative component of total AAM in the form of an acceleration of zonal mean zonal wind in the tropical-subtropical upper troposphere. Thus, under strong global warming, a super-rotational state emerged in the tropical upper troposphere. The trend in zonal mean zonal wind in the meridional plane was characterized by 1) a tropical-subtropical pattern with two maxima near 30 degrees in the upper troposphere, and 2) a tripole pattern in the Southern Hemisphere extending through the entire troposphere and having a positive maximum at 60 degreesS. The implication of the projected increase of global AAM for future changes of the length of day is discussed. The CCCma coupled global warming simulation, like many previous studies, shows a significant increase of tropical SST and includes a zonally asymmetric component that resembles El Nino SST anomalies. In the CCCma transient simulations, even though the tropical SST and global AAM both increased nonlinearly with time, the ratio of their time increments Delta AAM/Delta SST remained approximately constant at about 0.9 x 10(25) kg m(2) s(-1) (degreesC)(-1). This number is close to its counterpart for the observed global AAM response to El Nino. It is suggested that this ratio may be useful as an index for intercomparisons of different coupled model simulations.",1
"Most efforts to define a level of dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI) with the climate system are framed in terms of global annual mean surface temperature change, with 2 degrees C above preindustrial being the most widely accepted climate policy 'target'. Yet, no actual large-scale threshold (or 'tipping point') in the climate system (of which there are probably several) has been clearly linked to 2 degrees C global warming. Of those that can be indirectly linked to global temperature change, the dangerous levels are necessarily imprecise and vary, with estimates ranging from similar to 1 degrees C above preindustrial upwards. Some potential thresholds cannot be meaningfully linked to global temperature change, others are sensitive to rates of climate change, and some are most sensitive to spatial gradients of climate change. In some cases, the heterogeneous distributions of reflective (sulfate) aerosols, absorbing (black carbon) aerosols, and land use could be more dangerous than changes in globally well-mixed greenhouse gases. Hence, the framing of Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in terms of stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations (within a time frame), is too narrow to prevent some types of DAI. To address this, a reframed policy objective is proposed; to limit the overall magnitude, rate of change, and spatial gradients of anthropogenic radiative forcing, and resultant climate change, through restriction of emissions of anthropogenic aerosols, patterns of land use, and concentrations of short-lived, as well as long-lived, greenhouse gases.

"Some future directions for mycorrhizal research are discussed. Data from The IPCC Third Assessment Reports 2001 on elevated carbon dioxide the concentration and consequences regarding global climate change, form the basis for arguments that a better understanding of the mycorrhizal activities with regard to controlling carbon flow and plant nutrient flow is essential. Mycorrhiza can be regarded as energy and nutrient switches in the plant roots and it is suggested that more studies on mycorrhizal carbon relations are necessary. The impact of the genomic research era on mycorrhizal research is suggested to be of major importance during the years to come, and it is claimed that stronger interactions between different disciplines will be essential.",1
"The Triassic-Jurassic boundary marks a major faunal mass extinction, but records of accompanying environmental changes are Limited. Paleobotanical evidence indicates a fourfold increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and suggests an associated 3 degrees to 4 degrees C ""greenhouse"" warming across the boundary. These environmental conditions are calculated to have raised leaf temperatures above a highly conserved Lethal Limit, perhaps contributing to the >95 percent species-level turnover of Triassic-Jurassic megaflora.",1
"Environmental conditions outside the periphery of a species' distribution prevent population persistence, hence peripheral populations live under conditions different from those of core populations. Peripheral areas are characterized by variable and unstable conditions, relative to core areas. Peripheral populations are expected to be genetically more variable, since the variable conditions induce fluctuating selection, which maintains high genetic diversity. Alternatively, due to marginal ecological conditions at the periphery, populations there are small and isolated; the within-population diversity is low, but the between-population genetic diversity is high due to genetic drift. It is also likely that peripheral populations evolve resistance to extreme conditions. Thus, peripheral populations rather than core ones may be resistant to environmental extremes and changes, such as global climate change induced by the anthropogenically emitted ''greenhouse gases''. They should be treated as a biogenetic resource used for rehabilitation and restoration of damaged ecosystems. Climatic transition zones are characterized by a high incidence of species represented by peripheral populations, and therefore should be conserved now as repositories of these resources, to be used in the future for mitigating undesirable effects of global climate change. Preliminary research revealed high phenotypic variability and high genetic diversity in peripheral populations relative to core populations of wild barley and the chukar partridge, respectively.",1
"This analysis of the Copenhagen Accord evaluates emission reduction pledges by individual countries against the Accord's climate-related objectives. Probabilistic estimates of the climatic consequences for a set of resulting multi-gas scenarios over the 21st century are calculated with a reduced complexity climate model, yielding global temperature increase and atmospheric CO2 and CO2-equivalent concentrations. Provisions for banked surplus emission allowances and credits from land use, land-use change and forestry are assessed and are shown to have the potential to lead to significant deterioration of the ambition levels implied by the pledges in 2020. This analysis demonstrates that the Copenhagen Accord and the pledges made under it represent a set of dissonant ambitions. The ambition level of the current pledges for 2020 and the lack of commonly agreed goals for 2050 place in peril the Accord's own ambition: to limit global warming to below 2 degrees C, and even more so for 5 degrees C, which is referenced in the Accord in association with potentially strengthening the long-term temperature goal in 2015. Due to the limited level of ambition by 2020, the ability to limit emissions afterwards to pathways consistent with either the 2 or 5 degrees C goal is likely to become less feasible.",1
"Coalbed methane is considered to be one of the major contributors to global warming. Geological prospecting of the rich-storage zone of methane is an important precondition for gas recovery projects. Shear zones along coal seams have long been considered as a major place where gas outbursts occur during mining, but they also have a positive aspect in coalbed methane prospecting and production because of their great quantity of fractures and high methane content. Mercury penetrating experiments on a series of variously sheared coal samples from the Pingdingshan coalfield, China, were performed. The results showed that tectonically sheared coals possess three to eight times more porosity and two to ten times more specific surface area than their normal counterparts. Moreover, brittlely deformed coals possess larger average fracture apertures representing a good condition for methane extraction whereas ductilely deformed coals show a fracture aperture even smaller than normal coals, which can explain why intensely sheared coals become difficult for methane extraction. The occurrence of a large number of tectonic fractures in a shear zone will make it easier for an artificial fracture to increase the permeability of coals in methane production. Therefore, except for locally ductile deformation areas, shear zones along coal seams are the best source and reservoir for methane gas production and, if this methane is extracted, it will help not only the reservoir but also protect the earth against global warming.",1
"This paper examines several prominent thermodynamic and dynamic factors responsible for the meridional and vertical warming asymmetries using a moist coupled atmosphere-surface radiative transportive four-box climate model. A coupled atmosphere-surface feedback analysis is formulated to isolate the direct response to an anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing from individual local feedbacks (water vapor, evaporation, surface sensible heat flux, and ice-albedo), and from the non-local dynamical feedback. Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback are stronger in low latitudes. The joint effect of the ice-albedo and dynamical greenhouse-plus feedbacks acts to amplify the high latitude surface warming whereas both the evaporation and dynamical greenhouse-minus feedbacks cause a reduction of the surface warming in low latitudes. The enhancement (reduction) of local feedbacks in high (low) latitudes in response to the non-local dynamic feedback further strengthens the polar amplification of the surface warming. Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback lead to an increase of lapse rate in both low and high latitudes. The stronger total dynamic heating in the mean state in high latitudes is responsible for a larger increase of lapse rate in high latitudes in the direct response and response to water vapor feedback. The local evaporation and surface sensible heat flux feedbacks reduce the lapse rate both in low and high latitudes through cooling the surface and warming the atmosphere. The much stronger evaporation feedback leads to a final warming in low latitudes that is stronger in the atmosphere than the surface.",1
"Time-slices of eight global climate model (GCM) response simulations of the IPCC IS92a, CMIP2, SRES A2, B2 and A1B greenhouse gas scenarios have been downscaled using the HIRHAM atmospheric regional climate model (RCM). The area covers Central and Northern Europe, adjacent sea-areas and Greenland. The GCM data were provided from the Max Planck Institute, Germany (MPI), the Hadley Centre, U.K. (HC), the Bjerknes Centre, Norway (BCCR) and University of Oslo, Norway (UiO). The resulting ensemble covers a range of future climate realizations from different global models, different greenhouse gas scenarios and natural climate variability. In order to present trends in statistical parameters including extreme events and their return periods, the downscaled response data are combined as an ensemble of equally valid possible realizations. The combined statistics is obtained after adjustments accounting for (i) different set-ups of the respective GCMs in producing the control climate and (ii) the variable range of time between the control and scenario periods. We find that annual extreme events of daily precipitation and wind speed in the control climate become more frequent in the scenario period over large areas in Northern Europe. The variability in the regional result appears sensitive to the phase of the Scandinavian pattern.",1
"Changes in the East Asian monsoon and the related river discharge under global warming conditions are investigated using 2 time-slice simulations of the IS92a scenario with a T106 atmospheric general circulation model (ECHAM4) for 1971 to 1980 and 2041 to 2050. Daily runoff and drainage calculated by the land-surface scheme are used as input to a hydrological model to diagnose changes in the Yangtze River and Zhujiang River discharges. In the future climate, the simulated annual cycle of precipitation over the southeastern coastal area of China is systematically shifted about 1 mo ahead compared with the present-day climate, and the rainy season starts 1 mo earlier for the Yangtze River Valley and North China. In line with the surface-warming distribution change, the East Asian summer monsoon (EAM) flow strengthens. This causes increased precipitation in North China. In winter, the subtropical part of the EAM flow strengthens and leads to a large increase in rainfall over the EAM region. The discharges of the Zhujiang and Yangtze rivers in the future climate decrease in the late summer and autumn, to which both increased evaporation and an early retreat of the monsoon rainfall contribute. In the early and mid-summer, the Yangtze River discharge increases, mainly due to the large increase in precipitation in the preceding months, which has been stored in the catchment.",1
"The majority of the scientific community involved in climate research is convinced of the reality of a current and future global warming due to the greenhouse effect, a change that must be largely caused by human activities. However, a minority of scientists is still skeptical of the notion that mankind is significantly influencing the climate of the earth, and it therefore argues against taking certain measures to avert this alleged global warming. In recent years the media have given considerable coverage to the statements of these skeptics. Reasons for their statements range from a simple argument that we do not understand the earth's climate system well enough to predict the future, to more complex arguments involving negative feedbacks and changes of solar activity. They question whether the global temperature increase in this century of up to 0.6 K is primarily a result of worldwide burning of fossil fuels. The purpose of this article is to show that the statements of this skeptical school of thought need to be critically analyzed (and in some cases refuted) in the light of current understanding of the planetary system that determines our climate. There is also another school of thought that agrees about the reality of present and future global warming, and claims that this will be beneficial for most of mankind and that it should be encouraged. The policy implications of the latter view are in many respects similar to those of the group that are not convinced that a significant global warming will occur. Both schools of thought argue against taking immediate steps to slow the climate change.",1
"To evaluate the effects of logging on soil greenhouse gas flux in a tropical rain forest, we measured CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes at logged and unlogged sites in Peninsular Malaysia N = 7-27 at each site). Although soil temperature at the logged sites was higher than at unlogged sites, Soil CO2 flux did not differ between sites. The CH4 consumption at the logged sites tended to be less than that at unlogged sites, and some soils at the logged sites emitted CH4. These results suggest that logging can decrease CH4 consumption or even convert CH4 sinks into sources. The increase in soil bulk density after logging might lowered the effective diffusivity of CH4 and O-2 availability in soils, which might limit the CH4 consumption at the logged sites. N2O fluxes were increased significantly for at least 1 year after logging because of an increase in soil nitrogen availability. Logging decreased the CH4 absorption rate and increased the N2O emission rate of the soil. Based on these findings, we conclude that logging in tropical rain forests increases the emission of CH4 and N2O for at least 1 year after logging, thus potentially contributing to global warming.

"Sea level oscillated between 5500 and 3500 years ago at Murrells Inlet, South Carolina (33 degrees 33'N, 79 degrees 02'W). The oscillation is well constrained by marsh foraminiferal zonations. For the same time interval, data from Nova Scotia indicate an acceleration in sea-level rise and a report from the Gull of St. Lawrence suggests an oscillation of sea level at the same time. The implications are: (1) there was a eustatic sealevel oscillation of about 2 m in the mid-Holocene on the east coast of North America that is not detectable in present geophysical models of relative sea-level change; (2) if an anthropogenically derived global warming of 4 degrees C takes place, sea level may rise as much as 2 m in 500 yr along the east coast of North America. It appears that the initial rapid rise is recorded all along the eastern seaboard of North America, but detection of the subsequent fall is dependent on existing glacio-isostatic effects (either subsidence or rebound) that are independent of eustatic sea level.",1
"The use of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and acetylene (C2H2) in the presence of helium has been examined fur oxide etching in an inductively coupled, high density plasma etch tool. Oxide etch rates have been measured for blanket films and For patterned wafers with features of 0.6, 0.45, and 0.35 mum nominal critical dimension, while process performance has been assessed with cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. Optical emission spectroscopy has been employed in situ to characterize the species present in the plasma, and quadrupole mass spectrometry has been used to analyze process affluent sampled between the chamber outlet and the turbo pump inlet. Polymer film deposited on the surface of the oxide layer has been studied with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Global warming emissions for a range of process conditions have been quantified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and are compared to emissions from more typical oxide etch processes on the same tool type. Results indicate that the NF3/C2H2 chemistry is capable of etching oxide anisotropically, while offering a significantly lower global warming impact than current oxide etch chemistries.

"BACKGROUND: The farm animal sector is the single largest anthropogenic user of land, contributing to many environmental problems, including global warming and climate change. OBJECTTVES: The aim of this study was to synthesize and expand upon existing data on the contribution of farm animal production to climate change. METHODS: We analyzed the scientific literature on farm animal production and documented greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as various mitigation strategies. DISCUSSIONS: An analysis of meat, egg, and milk production encompasses not only the direct rearing and slaughtering of animals, but also grain and fertilizer production for animal feed, waste storage and disposal, water use, and energy expenditures on farms and in transporting feed and finished animal products, among other key impacts of the production process as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and far-reaching changes in current animal agriculture practices and consumption patterns are both critical and timely if GHGs from the farm animal sector are to be mitigated.",1
"Reducing the adverse effects of global warming and climate change is a critical issue. For the past 15 years the University of East Anglia has been addressing these concerns through a multi-pronged approach using technical means of low-energy building design, installing renewable energy sources, good energy management and raising awareness. Through good energy management, the university has been able to reduce the energy consumption of already low-energy buildings by as much as 50%. A large-scale building-integrated photovoltaic (PV) array has been installed along with on-site generation of heating, cooling and electricity via a 3 MW combined heat and power (CHP) plant and, recently, an adsorption chiller. In this paper, potential improvements in a more effective utilisation of PV electricity will also be discussed, as will future plans to reduce carbon emissions by installing further sources of renewable energy. The last part of this paper focuses on the CRed ( Community Carbon Reduction) Programme established in 2003 and based at the university. The CRed programme takes up this challenge through innovative and integrated ways in promoting a low carbon economy and, in particular, promoting awareness.",1
"Coral reefs have reconstituted themselves after previous large sea-level variations, and climate changes. For the past 6000 years of unusually stable sea-level, reefs have grown without serious interruptions. During recent decades, however, new stresses threaten localized devastation of many reefs. A new period of global climate change is occurring, stimulated by anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. Coral reefs will cope well with predicted sea-level rises of 4.5 cm per decade, but reef islands will not. Higher sea levels will provide corals with greater room for growth across reef flats, but there are no foreseeable mechanisms for reef island growth to keep pace with sea-level rise, therefore many low islands may ultimately become uninhabitable. Climate change will introduce localized variations in weather patterns, but changes to individual reefs cannot be predicted. Reefs on average should cope well with regional climate change, as they have coped with similar previous fluctuations. Air temperature increases of 0.2-0.3 degrees C/decade will induce slower increases in sea-surface temperatures, which may cause localized, or regional increases in coral bleaching. Changes in rainfall will impact on reefs near land masses. Likewise, increased storms and variations in El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may stress some reefs, but not others. The greatest impact of climate change will be a synergistic enhancement of direct anthropogenic stresses (excessive sediment and pollution from the land; over-fishing, especially via destructive methods; mining of coral rock and sand; and engineering modifications), which currently cause most damage to coral reefs. Many of the world's reefs have been degraded and more will be damaged as anthropogenic impacts increase under the 'demophoric' increases in population (demos) and economic (phoric) activity. This biotic and habitat loss will result in severe economic and social losses. Reefs, however, have considerable recovery powers and losses can be minimized by effective management of direct human impacts and reducing indirect threats of global climate change.",1
"Elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are implicated in global warming. Mitigation of this requires capture of CO, from fossil fuel power sources and storage in subsurface aquifers or depleted hydrocarbon fields. Demonstration projects and financial analysis suggest that this is technologically feasible. CO2 must retained below ground for 10(4) y into the future to enable the surface carbon cycle to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. To provide robust predictions of the performance of disposal sites at the required timescale, one approach is to study natural CO2 accumulations, which give insight into rock-CO2-brine interactions over timescales of 10(3)-5.10(6) y. In contrast to geochemical modelling predictions, natural CO2 fields in the North Sea (Brae, Miller, Magnus, Sleipner), at 4.0 km and deeper, do not show the mineral products which are predicted to form. Calcite and feldspar still comprise 5-20% of the rock, and dawsonite is absent. SE Australian and Arizona reservoir sandstones also do not fit to geochemical predictions. A state of disequilibrium possibly exists, so that existing geochemical modelling is not capable of accurately predicting kinetic-controlled and surface-chemistry controlled mineral dissolution or precipitation in natural subsurface sandstones on the required timescales. Improved calibration of models is required. Geochemical evidence from laboratory experiments (months to years duration), or from enhanced oil recovery (30 y duration) are again too short in timescale. To help to bridge the 10(4) y gap, it may be useful to examine natural analogues (10(3)-10(6) y), which span the timescale required for durable disposal. The Colorado Plateau is a natural CO2 system, analogous to an hydrocarbon system, where 100 Gm(3) CO., fields occur, sourced from 0-5 Ma volcanics. Deep erosion has exposed the sediments which formed CO2 source, CO2 carrier, CO2 reservoir, CO2 trap, CO2 seal. Some very large CO2 traps are now exhumed, and some are currently leaking to form cool travertine springs at the surface. Natural examples at Salt Wash Green River, and at Moab Fault are briefly described. These show extensive bleaching of haematite which may be locally redeposited, carbonate cementation delta C-13-7 parts per thousand around point sources, and silica precipitation, which may seal leak-off on buried anticline crests. Accurate geochemical modelling of the long-term performance of CO2 storage sites, requires improved understanding of CO2 reaction paths and reaction rates with aquifer reservoirs and with overlying seals. Robust prediction of disposal site performance is not possible without this.",1
"Collectively, man-made emissions of a few greenhouse gases may cause about the same amount of global warming as increasing carbon dioxide. Among the most potent of these non-CO2 greenhouse gases are the perfluorocarbons that have extraordinarily long atmospheric lifetimes of 10 000 to more than 50 000 yr. We report atmospheric concentrations over two decades, between 1978 and 1997, of the three most abundant perfluorocarbons-CF4, C2F6, and C3F8-and delineate the sources that account for the present abundances and trends. We show that C2F6 and C3F8 are present at only 2.9 and 0.2 pptv, respectively. CF4 is the most abundant perfluorocarbon at 74 pptv (in 1997) of which about 40 pptv are from natural emissions, 33 pptv from aluminum manufacturing, and 1 pptv from the semiconductor industry. The increasing trend of CF4 has slowed in recent years due to the major reductions in the emission rate per ton of aluminum produced. The effect of the falling emission factor is partially offset by increased production and increasing use by the semiconductor industry.",1
"While poleward species migration in response to recent climatic warming is widely documented, few studies have examined entire range responses of broadly distributed sessile organisms, including changes on both the trailing (equatorward) and the leading (poleward) range edges. From a detailed population census throughout the entire geographical range of Aloe dichotoma Masson, a long-lived Namib Desert tree, together with data from repeat photographs, we present strong evidence that a developing range shift in this species is a 'fingerprint' of anthropogenic climate change. This is explained at a high level of statistical significance by population level impacts of observed regional warming and resulting water balance constraints. Generalized linear models suggest that greater mortalities and population declines in equatorward populations are virtually certainly the result, due to anthropogenic climate change, of the progressive exceedance of critical climate thresholds that are relatively closer to the species' tolerance limits in equatorward sites. Equatorward population declines are also broadly consistent with bioclimatically modelled projections under anticipated anthropogenic climate change but, as yet, there is no evidence of poleward range expansion into the area predicted to become suitable in future, despite good evidence for positive population growth trends in poleward populations. This study is among the first to show a marked lag between trailing edge population extinction and leading edge range expansion in a species experiencing anthropogenic climate change impacts, a pattern likely to apply to most sessile and poorly dispersed organisms. This provides support for conservative assumptions of species' migration rates when modelling climate change impacts for such species. Aloe dichotoma's response to climate change suggests that desert ecosystems may be more sensitive to climate change than previously suspected.",1
"Climate models predict that the concentration of water vapor in the upper troposphere could double by the end of the century as a result of increases in greenhouse gases. Such moistening plays a key rote in amplifying the rate at which the climate warms in response to anthropogenic activities, but has been difficult to detect because of deficiencies in conventional observing systems. We use satellite measurements to highlight a distinct radiative signature of upper tropospheric moistening over the period 1982 to 2004. The observed moistening is accurately captured by climate model simulations and lends further credence to model projections of future global warming.",1
"Understanding the natural variation of carbon within the soil, and between soil types, is crucial to improve predictive models of carbon cycling in high and mid-latitude ecosystems in response to global warming. We measured the carbon isotope distributions (C-12, C-13 and C-14) in soil organic matter (SOM) from Podzols, Brown Podzolic soils and Stagnohumic Gleysols from the British uplands, which were then compared with the total amounts and turnover of carbon in these soils. We did so by sampling at 2-cm intervals down six profiles of each soil type. The average amount of carbon stored in the top 28 cm of the Stagnohumic Gleysols is twice that of the other two soils. The C-13 content and C-14 age show a general increase with depth in all soils, and there is also a significant correlation between isotopic variation and the main pedogenic features. The latter suggests that soil-forming processes are significant in determining the carbon isotope signatures retained in SOM. Organic matter formed since 1960 is not found below 5 cm in any of the soils. Evidently organic detritus in the surface layers (LF and Oh) is rapidly mineralized. This accords with our modelled net annual C fluxes which show that more than 80% of the CO2 emanating from these soils is derived from the top 5 cm of each profile. Although these soils contain much carbon, they do not appear to assimilate and retain SOM rapidly. The mean residence time of most of their carbon is in the 2-50 years range, so the soils are fairly ineffective sinks for excess CO2 in the atmosphere. Under the predicted future 'greenhouse' climate, likely to favour more rapid microbial decomposition of organic materials, these soils are a potential source of CO2 and are therefore likely to accelerate global warming.",1
"In the context of their role in net global warming, CO2 emissions were calculated for fuel-consuming processes associated with arable land crop production in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Fuel-consuming processes included tractor-based field operations, transportation of products and materials and grain drying. In conventional tillage (CT) systems, total CO2 emissions from fuel consumption were 826.2, 605.4, 424.2 and 738.7 kg CO2 ha(-1) for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), adzuki bean (Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi and Ohashi) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production, respectively. In winter wheat production, 55% of total CO2 emission were released from kerosene and electricity use for grain drying, the remainder from tractor-based field operations. In contrast, for sugar beet, adzuki bean and potato production, field operations were the main contributors to CO2 emissions. Of the field operations, tillage and harvesting required the largest amounts of fuels. Under reduced tillage (RT) systems in which soil preparation in early spring was reduced and plowing after harvesting was omitted, 47.51 ha(-1) of diesel oil equivalent to 125.4 kg CO2 ha(-1) could be saved, regardless of crop species. Consequently, total CO2 emissions could be reduced by 15-29%, respectively, in winter wheat and adzuki bean production. In the Tokachi region of Hokkaido, a primary arable crop production region in Japan, annual CO2 emissions under CT and RT for the four crops produced were estimated at 82.7 Gg CO2 per year and 67.4 Gg CO2 per year, respectively. Besides reduced fuel costs, the use of RT production systems could significantly reduce the large quantities Of CO2 released as a result of arable land crop production in northern Japan.

"The forest cover of Thailand has been characterized according to the Holdridge Life Zone Classification, a model that correlates climatic features with vegetation distribution Six Holdridge life zone types of forest cover are found in Thailand: subtropical dry forest, subtropical moist forest, subtropical wet forest, tropical dry forest, tropical moist forest, and tropical wet forest. Climate change scenarios were simulated by three general circulation models: two United Kingdom Meteorological Office models (the low and high resolution versions) and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies model. These scenarios were used to simulate the effects of future climate change on Thai forests. The ratios of precipitation and the absolute values of temperature changes were incorporated into a baseline climate scenario from the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis. Under the climate change scenarios simulated by the three general circulation models, the subtropical dry forest could potentially disappear, and areas of tropical very dry forest would appear. In general, the area of subtropical life zone would decline from about 50% to 20%-12% of total cover, whereas the tropical life zone would expand its cover from 45% to 80%. All three general circulation model scenarios suggest that the tropical dry forest has the greatest potential to extend into the subtropical moist forest. This analysis suggests that global climate change would have a profound effect on the future distribution and health of Thai forests.",1
"Humans are engaged in an uncontrolled experiment in planetary heating. Each decade, the concentration of CO2, methane and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is increasing by about 4%. All signs point toward unprecedented rates of warming and climate change. Many plant and animal species living in natural ecosystems will perish because they will be unable to keep up with shifting climatic zones. Warming exacerbates another biomedical problem - the influx of alien animals, plants and pathogens. These introduced species, many from the tropics, will not only increase the variety and incidence of tropical diseases, but will also affect the quality of the wilderness experience and hence, the popularity of outdoor recreation. Some personal actions and political prophylaxis are recommended.",1
"An overview of the importance of fossil fuels in supplying the energy requirements of the 21st century, their future supply, and the impact of their use on global climate is presented. Current and potential alternative energy sources are considered. It is concluded that even with substantial increases in energy derived from other sources, fossil fuels will remain a major energy source for much Of the 21st century and the sequestration of CO2 will be an increasingly important requirement.",1
"Releases of halocarbons into the atmosphere over the last 50 years are among the factors that have contributed to changes in the Earth's climate since pre-industrial times. Their individual and collective potential to contribute directly to surface climate change is usually gauged through calculation of their radiative efficiency, radiative forcing, and/or Global Warming Potential (GWP). For those halocarbons that contain chlorine and bromine, indirect effects on temperature via ozone layer depletion represent another way in which these gases affect climate. Further, halocarbons can also affect the temperature in the stratosphere. In this paper, we use a narrow-band radiative transfer model together with a range of climate models to examine the role of these gases on atmospheric temperatures in the stratosphere and troposphere. We evaluate in detail the halocarbon contributions to temperature changes at the tropical tropopause, and find that they have contributed a significant warming of similar to 0.4 K over the last 50 years, dominating the effect of the other well-mixed greenhouse gases at these levels. The fact that observed tropical temperatures have not warmed strongly suggests that other mechanisms may be countering this effect. In a climate model this warming of the tropopause layer is found to lead to a 6% smaller climate sensitivity for halocarbons on a globally averaged basis, compared to that for carbon dioxide changes. Using recent observations together with scenarios we also assess their past and predicted future direct and indirect roles on the evolution of surface temperature. We find that the indirect effect of stratospheric ozone depletion could have offset up to approximately half of the predicted past increases in surface temperature that would otherwise have occurred as a result of the direct effect of halocarbons. However, as ozone will likely recover in the next few decades, a slightly faster rate of warming should be expected from the net effect of halocarbons, and we find that together halocarbons could bring forward next century's expected warming by similar to 20 years if future emissions projections are realized. In both the troposphere and stratosphere CFC-12 contributes most to the past temperature changes and the emissions projection considered suggest that HFC-134a could contribute most of the warming over the coming century.",1
"The quantitative values of the urban warming effect over city stations in the Korean peninsula were estimated by using the warming mode of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of 55 years of temperature data, from 1954 to 2008. The estimated amount of urban warming was verified by applying the multiple linear regression equation with two independent variables: the rate of population growth and the total population. Through the multiple linear regression equation, we obtained a significance level of 0.05% and a coefficient of determination of 0.60. This means that it is somewhat liable to the estimated effects of urbanization, in spite of the settings of some supposition. The cities that show great warming due to urbanization are Daegu, Pohang, Seoul, and Incheon, which show values of about 35, 17, 16, and 10 degrees C, respectively. The areas that showed urban warming less than 0.2 degrees C are Chupungnyeong and Mokpo. On average, the total temperature increase over South Korea was about 37 degrees C: the amount of increase caused by the greenhouse effect is approximately 0.60 degrees C, and the amount caused by urban warming is approximately 0.77 degrees C.

"When changing from grass and croplands to forest, there are two competing effects of land cover change on climate: an albedo effect which leads to warming and an evapotranspiration effect which tends to produce cooling. It is not clear which effect would dominate. We have performed simulations of global land cover change using the NCAR CAM3 atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab ocean model. We find that global replacement of current vegetation by trees would lead to a global mean warming of 3 degrees C, nearly 60% of the warming produced under a doubled CO2 concentration, while replacement by grasslands would result in a cooling of 0.4 degrees C. It has been previously shown that boreal forestation can lead to warming; our simulations indicate that mid-latitude forestation also could lead to warming. These results suggest that more research is necessary before forest carbon storage should be deployed as a mitigation strategy for global warming.",1
"The rate coefficients for the reaction of OH with CH3F, CHF3, C2H5F, C4H2F8, and C5H2F10 were measured at temperatures between 232 and 378 K using the pulsed laser photolysis-laser-induced fluorescence technique. The rate coefficients for the reaction of O(1D) with the above molecules and CH2F2 were measured at room temperature using time-resolved vacuum-UV atomic resonance fluorescence detection of O(3P). The atmospheric lifetimes needed for the evaluation of global warming potentials were calculated for all six molecules using a one-dimensional atmospheric model using the kinetic data obtained in the present study.",1
